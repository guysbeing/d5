my semesterly planner by Veronica P. '27,mentally preparing for the trials ahead,by Veronica P. '27,"August 18, 2025","In less than a week I’ll be hopping on my flight back to Boston, and I’m so excited that I’m just about ready to kiss the Logan Airport floor, maybe even passionately make out with said airport floor 01 .!#@p!#@Anyways, without meaning to I’ve gotten attached to this organizational ritual to prepare for the start of each new semester. I think some bullet-journaling-sleeper-agent in my brain kicked in orientation week freshman year, deciding that a digital calendar simply wasn’t going to cut it. Instead, I took advantage of my brand new Goodnotes subscription to create my own digital planner, whose format I have remained loyal to five semesters down the line.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1273-400x264.png]!#@There are only really three components to each setup, and I’ve found these are the perfect spreads I need to feel like I have my bearings without overdoing it. Everyone’s brain works differently, of course, but the act of writing things out really helps me internalize information. So, if you’re looking for inspiration— or just to reaffirm that Google Calendar is all you need— here is my setup broken down:!#@p!#@The first page of my calendar is devoted to my recurring weekly schedule: from classes, to meetings, to highly-frequented office hours. This comes particularly in handy during those first few weeks when I’m still trying to remember room numbers or the minute difference between my Monday and Wednesday lineup.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1269-400x250.jpg]!#@Next in my planner you’ll find a page for each month of the semester. I write down holidays, assignment due dates (color coded of course), events I’m looking forward to, and other appointments. Getting this birds eye view helps me plan ahead for particularly stressful weeks, or get motivated by the promise of a three-day weekend.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1271-400x251.jpg]!#@The very final page of my planner is the most frequently edited, and that is my todo list. It tends to contain 5-7 days worth of tasks at any given time, with completed tasks being erased to make room for the next set. This is also color coded by class, and I add the due-date to the side of each one. Often, I’ll start my mornings off by outlining the tasks I want to tackle before the end of the day.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1272-400x526.jpg]!#@And that’s it!! Time to bask in these final precious weeks where my todo list doesn’t feel absolutely full to the brim. Happy back to school season, everyone <3!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1273-400x264.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1269-400x250.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1271-400x251.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1272-400x526.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-semesterly-planner/
Rejection Therapy by Kayode D. '27,and my insatiable urge to collect trading cards,by Kayode D. '27,"August 16, 2025","Today I flew back to campus!!#@p!#@I returned earlier that most students because I am an Orientation Captain. I have to come early for training and to help prepare everything for the prefrosh⁠01  impending arrival.!#@p!#@I was in the airport for my 8AM flight from Louisville to Boston, when I ran into Andrew P. ’28 Haylea B. ’27! They were flying early as well for orientation and REX⁠02 , and our seats were next to one another!!#@p!#@On the plane!#@p!#@I listened to You Did It! a delightful new album by a band called Bugs Frogs & Snakes.  Would recommend!!#@p!#@When the plane landed, we made jokes about clapping so the pilot knows they did a good job. Otherwise how would they know, you know? I suggested asking for a photo with the pilot. Hailey mentioned a recent trend on tiktok⁠03 called “rejection therapy,” where people ask for things that they know they won’t get knowing they’ll face rejections, so that they become more used to it. Here’s a video:!#@p!#@The thing is, though, that in this video, he isn’t rejected, and they do let him climb inside the firetruck! So I said I was gonna do it, I was gonna ask the pilot for a picture. Andrew said he would, too, to make it less awkward.!#@p!#@When we got down there, we asked the pilot, and he said yes!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pilot-picture.jpg]!#@We began talking with him about how long he had to train to be a pilot⁠04 and how the Titans are gonna do this season⁠05 . Then he asked if we wanted trading cards.!#@p!#@DID HE JUST SAY TRADING CARDS??? Like, PILOT TRADING CARDS?? Like, I can talk to MORE PILOTS and collect PILOT TRADING CARDS????!#@p!#@My nerd brain neurons were activated. He grabbed his briefcase and pulled out a stack of DELTA AIRLINE TRADING CARDS.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/card-front-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/card-back-800x1067.jpg]!#@He told us that they have these on all Delta Airline planes⁠06 .!#@p!#@This rejection therapy experience worked, but not in the way that I expected at all!! Now I want to take pictures with EVERY pilot I meet! You literally never know when someone might hand you a trading card [👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀].!#@p!#@So now it’s  🫵 YOUR TURN 🫵!#@p!#@As you come to campus for the first time or for the nth time, ask your pilot for a picture! Ask for a trading card! Put a picture in the comments! I wanna see what the other ones look like.!#@p!#@Also, don’t fear rejection, I guess? That’s probably the moral of this story, but I can’t get over how STINKING COOL MY AIRPLANE TRADING CARD IS. Maybe I’ll try doing things that are awkward more now. I watched a few more of those rejection therapy videos and they are so awkward, but look like they teach so much. I hate “failure”, but I know how good it is for you.!#@p!#@Also, reject technology, embrace tradition. Why limit yourselves to the confines of “technological advancement” [escalators] when you can unleash your potential and forge your own path? [take the stairs]!#@p!#@OK, I need to go to the store now because I have no food.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@Update: I bought only fruit and now I just have fruit. If you killed my character I would drop trading cards and fruit, like a common enemy.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pilot-picture.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/card-front-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/card-back-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/rejection-therapy/
proof of life by Gloria Z. '26,hmm :thinking-face:,by Gloria Z. '26,"August 16, 2025","preface:!#@p!#@Last fall, I took a lighter academic load, two classes, so that I could work an internship during the daytime hours. I was writing embedded code for hardware systems, which was somewhat engaging, but, in true Severance fashion, I felt myself blink out and in of existence as I crossed the threshold of the office each morning and evening. The meat of each day was some combination of staring at Jira, VS Code, C++ docs, and the free snack selection in the mini-kitchen; what I remember best, instead, are the bones before and after, the slow trek through Cambridge and Somerville, first past looming biotech towers, then through not-quite-suburban residential areas, then into an area in the midst of construction, still carrying the vestiges of 1900s industrial Cambridge. The image is vivid: a placid fall scene with sidewalks covered in paper-mache leaves and a strange sort of black dirt residue, with adorable houses lining the two-lane (no bike lane!) streets. They sported dusty candy colors, worn and chipped in all the right ways; in the front lawns, there were half-open grills, smudged plastic toys, and low-slung lounge chairs faded by weather and use. Proofs of life.!#@p!#@I found myself staring at these houses each day as I passed, wondering about the poor souls oxidizing inside. I felt myself grow thirty years older in the span of a block; the horizon melted from my thoughts, replaced by stacks of unopened mail and grocery store receipts. A ticking timer on a carton of milk and a slab of chicken waiting to be thawed. An overwhelming sense of doom would trickle and pool in my chest, like syrup, softening.!#@p!#@Maybe it’s because I grew up in the suburbs, but I’ve always felt a creeping sense of dread at this vision of settling–not settling as in settling for something less, but settling as in stopping, resting, putting down roots deep into the dirt. With this dread came an aversion to all those elements of domestic or “traditional” life: having kids, getting married, buying a single-family home. Filling up gas, having a mortgage. Planting a sapling in the front yard. I’ve realized I like the feeling of always being somewhat agitated, having something on the horizon, and, probably unrealistically, I have this idea of “adulthood” as a flat circle: mostly always the same, spinning uniformly, stable, settled, secure, satisfied. In some way, then, I’m scared of being satisfied–not in a sigma male productivity core way, but in an almost childish way, like a kid who has eyes bigger than her stomach and wants to have it all, no matter the cost.!#@p!#@Every summer I feel that I get a taste of this settling. Whether I’m doing research or working an internship, life slows down, to an almost sluggish pace, no more random events, no more chance encounters, no more long nights in the library. My calendar is empty save the occasional social event, and I don’t need notifications to remember what’s going on in my day: I leave the house at 8:02AM and take the 8:13AM bus; my days are work plus workout plus meals, and maybe one other thing if I have the time and energy. The weeks, minus minor differences, seem to blur together, especially when I’m in the office. It’s somewhat monotonous, yet very comfortable. After all, on many counts, life is better than when I’m in school. I sleep consistently and well, I eat healthy meals at regular times, I feel generally more in control and steady, more relaxed in my off hours. The weekends mean free time and leisure, rather than extra time to catch up on psets. I have more time to watch movies, to try new restaurants, and to spend extended periods of time in nature.!#@p!#@And yet, there’s still a part of me that thrashes and whines: “Is this it? Is this all?” It feels uncomfortable to rotate slowly in place, without some menacing goal on the horizon. So maybe this is why people enter midlife and run a marathon. (As someone who picked up running this summer, this is mostly a dig at myself.) Grabbing coffee from the micro kitchen, I can blink and see the afterimage of ten more years unrolling in front of me – graduating, working, having a family, baking bread on the weekends. By all means a happy life, really.!#@p!#@Maybe I’m preempting a midlife crisis (and therefore inciting one), prompted by an impending graduation and an immense sense of newness with each passing season. Over the past year I’ve felt a guttural drop into early adulthood, not a swan dive off a cliff but a slow winding descent, as I started booking my own flights and travel plans and scheduling monthly payments into my Roth IRA. First apartment, first taxes, first conversation with my mom as (almost) equal adults rather than child and parent. At the same time, the future slit itself open and fell splayed like a cake box; my classmates graduated or took leave and generally dispersed, calling new cities “home” and sinking their own pincers deep into the black dirt. I felt that there was never any rush after all. I felt more pressure than ever to pick the figs up off the ground.!#@p!#@Anyway –!#@p!#@May in Boston means 65 degrees, air the same temperature as your body, on the precipice of sweat. The end of junior year means sitting in a sticky circle with friends you think you understand a little better now, tracing conversations you’ve already had a million times, but now with slightly different vocabulary and a bit more shared history. It’s asking them how much they value their relationships versus their work, in a meta impersonal sort of way, and hearing the same answer that you would give, but maybe not the answer you’re supposed to want to hear. It’s folding all your belongings over themselves into two tired boxes, carrying them by hand over the bridge, and stashing your bike in an anonymous emailer’s backyard shed. I had spent spring semester frantically and methodically reducing, simmering my life on medium heat until the moisture steamed off, trying to loop into a point I couldn’t quite grasp. There was a strange freneticism to the semester, of collapsing a billion possible futures into one, and of gently parting soft lips and peeling one back into many, every conversation tinged with slight hopeful premonition.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ye-800x325.png]!#@May in Boston is – false beginnings, casual goodbyes, a sky seeping honey and salt. It’s pinch, blink, smile, turn. It is the summer ahead like an overripe orange. It is joy, after all.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ye-800x325.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/proof-of-life/
first time in cdmx by Aiden H. '28,"and first time out of the US, but not the first time having an ethnicity crisis",by Aiden H. '28,"August 15, 2025","Last week, I left the country for the first time! This was really important to me for a couple of reasons:!#@p!#@So for four-ish days my girlfriend and I went to visit my cousin who lives in the city. Here’s a photo dump/itinerary of what we did:!#@p!#@Monday, August 4!#@p!#@fly DEN -> LAX -> MEX and get obsessed with Good Coffee, Great Coffee⁠03 for the entire 10 hours!#@p!#@Tuesday, August 5!#@p!#@We woke up starving and went to get brunch in Condesa around Parque México, which is only like a 5 minute walk from where my cousin lives.

They were pretty strict about taking photos inside of the house, but it was definitely pretty. I always get weird in museums, so a part of me did have a existential moment about how these international icons and forever-important historical figures literally slept in the room I was standing in, but I would argue this adds to the ambiance.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Snapchat-1956486233-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Snapchat-1468996125-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Snapchat-806870589-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250815_171417-800x600.jpg]!#@After stalking around Coyoacán for a couple of hours, we went back north to eat dinner at Ling Ling, which, as much as I hate to admit, was a TikTok recommendation that was really good.

The Courage to Change by Kayode D. '27,Even Through the [Tough] Mud[der],by Kayode D. '27,"August 11, 2025","Last summer, I got into running. And it was really fun! I enjoyed it a lot! So much so that when my friend offered me her ticket for the Cambridge Half marathon last fall, I accepted. But first, I went on a run through Boston and tried to run to the airport [ THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA DON’T TRY THIS IT”S IMPOSSIBLE ⁠01 ]. I never ended up running the race after that. I did ended up writing a blog about it all, though.!#@p!#@This summer, I wanted to get back into running. I’ve been on break for too long, and it’s time to get back at it. So among a bunch of other goals, I told myself⁠02 that I was going to run a half marathon by the end of the summer.!#@p!#@But that didn’t end up happening. My friend, Paul I. ‘24 recently told me that I don’t keep my word. And that’s no shade to him at all! He told me that I say I’m going to do a lot of things, but don’t follow through. I reflected on myself and realized that he’s right. I have no trouble coming up with cool ideas but my execution is not there. I have SO MANY ideas for projects and blogs and things I want to do with my life, but I am not seeing any sustainable progress towards those goals. And most of that comes from never starting. And that sucks.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@Growing up, my family played a lot of board games. During covid we would play a full game of monopoly every night for weeks. You heard me right, a full game. Of MONOPOLY. Every night. And sometimes when I was losing I would get upset. But my dad would just repeat the same thing over and over: “Change your strategy.” If my brilliant plan wasn’t working, then why not switch directions? The only thing worse than beating a dead horse is betting on one, so why keep putting your hope in something that isn’t working? Sure, it could magically start working next turn and you could win it all. But it hasn’t magically worked so far, and it hasn’t magically worked any of the other nights, either. So what’s so different about tonight?!#@p!#@I realized that I needed to change my strategy. I’m trying to magically will myself to change, like somehow I’ll wake up tomorrow and just have the motivation and mojo to do everything I’ve ever dreamed of. But that’s a bad strategy– I would know, it hasn’t worked for me yet.!#@p!#@So now I know I need to make a change. But how? How do I get out of this rut of overthinking and spinning a wheel in place and actually start moving towards my goal?!#@p!#@Go to someone stronger than me.!#@p!#@Part 2: The Piano Analogy!#@p!#@I struggle with asking for help. It’s something I’ve been working on, but it’s still hard. I feel like I should be strong enough to get things done on my own, and I shouldn’t need help. In reality, I do just OK and refuse help belligerently.!#@p!#@One time I was asked what wish I would make if I had a genie. What immediately came to mind was something I’ve been wishing for a long time: That I would wake up tomorrow and magically know how to play the piano beautifully. Any song I could think of, just like that. I feel⁠03 like I can speak through drumming, like there is no buffer between idea and actualization, and I want to be able to do that on piano.⁠04!#@p!#@But as I told my friend this wish I had, I realized what I was missing out on. I was skipping all of the hard work. Yes, it sucks. And it’s hard. And it’s not always fun. But nothing worth doing is easy. If I woke up tomorrow and just knew how to play piano magically, I would only be cheating myself on what makes piano worth playing! It being hard is what makes it fun to do. So I don’t want to just know it all instantly, I want to work for it.⁠05!#@p!#@But recently I saw a second side to this analogy. If I have turned down this offer for instant magical piano skills, I am now sitting at a piano, trudging through learning to play. A friend or mentor comes up to me at my little piano and says “Kayode! I see you’re learning piano. You’re struggling a little bit. Here, let me teach you what I know.” I reply, “No! If I take handouts from people like you, I’m cheating myself out of the experience of learning! I need to grow on my own!”!#@p!#@And doesn’t that sound so stupid? The book of Proverbs, chapter 12 was literally written for people like me: “Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid… the way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.”!#@p!#@And I hear this and I say “That’s harsh, isn’t it?” But that’s the truth! Time and again, I try to do things–not just playing music, but even living life– without any help from those around me. I try to do it all by myself, as if that proves I am capable of doing it all on my own, when I don’t think that’s the lesson I need to be learning. It hasn’t worked for me yet.!#@p!#@Part 3: Enter B-Dawg!#@p!#@My friend, Brendan, is a BEAST. We grew up together, and I knew he was the perfect person to ask for help. I told him about my running aspirations and my fears with so little of the summer left. He got really excited and we signed up for a more manageable race: a 10k.!#@p!#@At first I thought this was lame. Why not go for the gold and do the half marathon? Maybe because I have never run in a real race ever and needed a benchmark to actually see my efforts actualize? I started running every night, and eventually was able to run 4 miles in a go. I got this in the bag.!#@p!#@My big running song this summer has been “Baseball Card” by Worthikids. I’m on the rise.!#@p!#@As we prepared to run over the next few weeks, Brendan told me he was going to stick with my pace, and that we weren’t going to stop. We were going to finish this thing.!#@p!#@And we did!!#@p!#@Haha, he never let me stop the entire time. We ran or jogged or walked for a bit, but we did the whole thing without stopping. We ended with a time of 1:12:00, which is pretty good, I’d say! Better than never running at all, at least.!#@p!#@I walked and he encouraged me, and we ended up running a full 10k! I ate like 5 bananas when it was over. Brendan told me that I would want to run another one in two weeks, and I did NOT believe him. But now it’s been two weeks…and lowkey kinda yeah. I could do that again. Whatever, man, I’m learning that when I’m wrong about something it’s not the end of the world.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/strava-running.png]!#@Tough Mudder?!#@p!#@After getting home, my dad told me that I should join him the NEXT weekend for the Tough Mudder.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MM-1-scaled-1-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tough-mudder-1-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EST-2-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PSX_20250131_183953-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BW-5__1_.jpg]!#@If you don’t know what that is, It’s like a 5k through the woods and mud, and there’s all these obstacles along the way. There are walls to climb and trenches to crawl through, and even an electric barbed wire. This is the kind of thing that band nerd Kayode would have noped RIGHT OUT OF in high school. But if I could run a 10k, I could run half of that where I’m allowed to stop at obstacles. And so I did.!#@p!#@Tough Mudder!!!!#@p!#@This thing was literally a blast. It was in my old hometown in Columbus Indiana, and was like summer camp and survivor mixed into one. A grand old time. I did it with my dad, brother, Brendan, and some other people from my church, and for the first time in literally my entire life, I felt athletic. I know that’s such a dorky thing to say, but I’ve always thought of myself as a band nerd who was bad at sports and anything athletic. That was just a mental jail! I could’ve been doing stuff like this the whole time!!!#@p!#@I texted The Boys right after and said we are 10,000% running a Tough Mudder this semester. Although, there aren’t any slated for this fall, there is a spartan race in FENWAY PARK this fall, so I might try to do that.!#@p!#@So the moral of the story!#@p!#@If you can’t find the courage to change, ask someone for help. I know I needed it, and I still need it now. I have soooooooooo many things I want to do, and so many blogs that I want to write. But I’m so obsessed with being perfect that I can’t even bring myself to write them. I’m sure someone out there wants to read about how Cru has been at MIT this last year, or how I placed SECOND at the MIT 2.007 competition, or maybe somebody wants to see Minesweeper Monday Episode 3…but probably not. No one ever asks me when it’s coming out or anything like that.!#@p!#@But that’s my goal with this blog, and this school year. To keep my word. And I don’t mean with the precision of a diamond encrusted plasma cutter. Just something–anything– to get moving.!#@p!#@So that’s what this blog is. I know my dad will say that this blog is too long, haha, but I needed to write it. Because until I start, I’ll never get anywhere.!#@p!#@When I used to get art journals in school, I would scribble all over the first page to break any idea that this journal had to be perfect. I would get so scared of making a bad drawing that I would never make anything. I was afraid of failure.!#@p!#@No more! No more trying to be perfect! We’re making a lot of mistakes this year so we learn and get better!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/strava-running.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MM-1-scaled-1-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tough-mudder-1-800x800.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EST-2-800x800.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PSX_20250131_183953-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BW-5__1_.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-courage-to-change/

"[Guest Post] Because Racecar, Friendships, and Family by Gloria Z. '26","By Monica C. '25: ""What I’ve learned about being an engineer, friend, and teammate by building three racecars with my best friends""",by Gloria Z. '26,"July 31, 2025","This is a blog by Monica C. ‘25 about her experience on the MIT Formula SAE team! Eight years ago, her brother, Kevin C. ‘17, wrote a guest post of his own about his time on the team, so now we’re bringing it full circle 😊. You can learn more about the team at https://fsae.mit.edu/.!#@p!#@I’m Monica C., an M.Eng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (6-2), and I wanted to write a blog about MIT Motorsports, a team that builds, designs, and competes a Formula style electric passenger racecar. Each year we build a new racecar from scratch, starting from the design stage to two annual competitions in May and June, where we race against colleges across the nation in the Formula SAE competition series. Our team consists of around 80 people now, divided into Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, Autonomous, and Business.!#@p!#@I’m the Software and Autonomous Engineering Lead, which means I am responsible for what I like to call “the soul of the car”: custom PCB low level firmware, data acquisition and telemetry, controls algorithms, and our very first autonomous driving system.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NEW_IMG_0456-800x493.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5800-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2639-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5889-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5492-800x533.jpg]!#@Our team has been around since 2001, and we started building electric vehicles in 2014. This year we’ve built our first 4 wheel drive vehicle, a major advancement in our team knowledge and technical prowess. This year is the largest technical jump we’ve made in my time on the team, requiring us to learn how to build a custom gearbox, our 550-Volt custom battery, controls algorithms for torque vectoring, and decoupled suspension. Our car’s 0-60⁠01 is 2.5 seconds, and we placed 9th at our most recent competition out of 90 teams. Our team is also developing our first driverless racecar. But none of this would be possible if we didn’t love the team we were on.!#@p!#@Being in Motorsports has taught me a lot about the engineering process, but more importantly, it’s taught me what it takes to work on a cross-functional team.!#@p!#@My advice boils down to: anything worthwhile building is hard, no one is going to have all the answers. Just go for it.!#@p!#@During my time at MIT, especially in the EECS⁠02 department, I’ve noticed that it’s easy to get funneled into one specific kind of software engineering role: building software products for software companies. I’ve heard classmates complain about there not being enough classes that teach you frontend/backend development or more practical skills that are used day to day in the industry. I think the real point of MIT isn’t to learn how to use specific tools, it’s to teach you how to think.!#@p!#@Through my work at MIT Motorsports, I’ve realized that software engineers can do much more, particularly when working on hardware-focused teams.!#@p!#@Being a software engineer in a hardware-heavy project is a unique experience. You’re not just writing code. You’re responsible for understanding mechanical and electrical systems you didn’t design, figuring out how different components interface and communicate, and often connecting all the pieces together. You spend time reading datasheets to understand sensor limitations, learning how signals propagate, and solving problems that span both hardware and software.!#@p!#@For example, from February to March, the EE⁠03 and software teams push to test our electrical system off the car by placing all our boards on a table and wiring them together for a full integration test. We call this process “EE on Bench,” where the final goal is to spin the motors that power the car with our custom battery. During that time, the software is actually mostly written, so I spend most of my time helping with assembly. I help make the wiring harnesses, assemble the boxes, and do full integration tests with the help from the electrical team.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ee_on_bench-1000x667.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF3644-1000x667.jpg]!#@To write good software, you need to understand the design requirements and constraints. What components does the software interface with? Who is going to be using the code, and what is their skill set? What are the latency, memory, and power design requirements?!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-800x450.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-1-800x450.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-2-800x450.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-3-800x450.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-4-800x450.png]!#@These are engineering questions. They are unrelated to writing code and syntax, but they shape your end product. Knowing how register timing works or how to use specific Python libraries helps with implementation. But writing good and useful software requires thinking carefully about integration, usability, and trade-offs; problems that engineers solve no matter their discipline. As a CS or EECS student, it’s often easy to lose sight of those values when hung up day to day in the implementation details and debugging code. Most importantly, I’ve realized how easy it is to get caught up writing code without asking yourself why am I writing this? I think the boom of the software and artificial intelligence era has encouraged people to learn how to code, but software engineers need to learn how to design.!#@p!#@That is why to be a good software engineer, you must first be a good engineer.!#@p!#@Nobody tells you how to build a driverless racecar. There’s no book with step by step instructions, lecture slides, or professors that have 20+ years of experience that are advising you. Formula SAE is a crash course on being pushed off the edge of a cliff and learning how to fly.!#@p!#@When I decided this year to build an autonomous subteam, I realized a lot of it was thinking about how in class we’d learn a lot about perception, motion planning, and controls, but how few opportunities there were to put all those concepts in practice. I wanted to create a team who wanted to learn how to build an autonomous car by building one. The autonomous team consists this year of 10 software engineers who, together, have learned about many different fields, including optics, motion planning, and even fundraising :).!#@p!#@None of us are AI experts; many of the autonomous team are freshmen who hadn’t even taken introduction to machine learning yet. But what I was selecting during recruiting were team members who were willing to take the risk and get their hands dirty.!#@p!#@Before I entered MIT, and even as I started as an undergraduate, I really looked up to the juniors and seniors on the team or in my classes who seemed so sure of themselves and to me, so much smarter. But now that I myself am a senior about to graduate I realized that they probably didn’t know that much more than me. They learned it all themselves. My best mentors didn’t really teach me any step by step processes. They instead gave me projects and the emotional encouragement that I could do it.!#@p!#@Transitioning from student to engineer requires starting to make your own design decisions and advocating for your own system. The best engineers I’ve met have a common trait: they’re not afraid to ask questions or look like they don’t understand something. That’s how they learn.!#@p!#@I think there are limits to this statement that are vaguely in the realm of “move fast and break things.” But generally speaking, I’ve seen too many student-run teams or startups fail because they aren’t decisive enough. They spend months in the “kickoff” phase of a project or idea and never commit to the first decisions, first purchases. Building anything worthwhile has its risks, and part of what I learned during my time in college is to stop being afraid of making mistakes. I purchased the wrong type of ethernet hub 4 or 5 times, and then we realized we didn’t even need it since we discovered we needed a hardware trigger for our cameras. But how would we have discovered that if we never tried?!#@p!#@From years that were more of a struggle, we learned that the team has to work well together in order to build a good car. Those years showed the younger generation on the team the vital importance of putting the team first before the car. When I say a good team, I don’t mean technically excellent; I mean a team that is capable of working together as a unit.!#@p!#@Therefore, since then, we focused a lot on building the team. Focusing on things like team bonding, trips, and just having fun in the workshop. We go on an annual ski trip, retreats, and competitions together! Throughout the year, we eat dinner together multiple times a week, watch Formula 1 races together in our shop, and have social events including mixers with other build teams and movie nights. If the team likes being around each other, they will enjoy working together to build the car.!#@p!#@Ultimately, if the team doesn’t like working together, the project won’t get done. Once we learned that, we built the best car in our team history in 2025.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC01892-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000045080028-800x530.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000045080002-800x530.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000080100027-800x530.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000026610003-800x530.jpg]!#@Sometimes all that people want is someone to listen to their concerns. On a team where you work 40+ hours a week, it is natural that disagreements come up, and we are not perfect people. As a leader, I’ve noticed that the most important thing is to listen. This might seem obvious, but I’ve had to learn how to be a good listener. I’ve come to realize that empathy, that is deeply feeling and understanding people’s feelings, has a few components:!#@p!#@When people are working super hard and it gets late at night, there’s something like sunk cost fallacy that occurs and people just keep bashing their head debugging instead of going home. Problems often look better in the morning with a fresh mind, as hard as it is to stop working when you’ve invested so much time. Going to bed early sets you up for a better attempt the next day.!#@p!#@One perk of working on Motorsports is that we have a boba shop and ice cream store right down the street. We often take breaks to go walk there and get a sweet treat when things aren’t working as we expect. We also have a playlist that we listen to throughout our late nights working together, which I will attach here:!#@p!#@Eight years ago, my older brother Kevin Chan ‘17 M.Eng ‘18 wrote Because Racecar and it’s fun to reflect on how much has changed:!#@p!#@“While our team can only dream about carbon fiber monocoques, four-wheel drive systems with in-hub motors, and semi-active suspensions…”!#@p!#@I’m proud to say that our Model Year 2025 car features our first four-wheel drive vehicle with in hub motors. This car also features our first decoupled roll-heave suspension. My whole family made it out for my last competition this year!!#@p!#@My dad and mom, Eric ‘85 and Mary, raised both of us to have a deep love for problem solving and engineering. In many ways, Formula SAE is a dream our family came up with together, albeit indirectly. My parents raised us to be able to fix our own bicycles and cars, to help around the house with maintenance, and encouraged us to pursue whatever silly things we wanted to build. None of them were even phased when I told them I started building a driverless car.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/family-1000x750.jpeg]!#@Some people ask me, “why do you do this to yourself?”!#@p!#@They ask me this because it’s hard to believe an MIT student would spend 40 hours a week doing anything except their schoolwork. When the nights are long and the car is not working, I often ask myself this question.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4263-2-400x533.jpg]!#@One of my favorite feelings is when we’re out on the track testing. If you close your eyes, you can hear the sounds of the car, which often indicate to you how the car is operating, how much the driver is slipping, whether any components are interfering. Often, listening to the car will tell you more than seeing it. You can hear everything working together, the cooling, the controls, the drivetrain, etc. I get a moment to process that wow. We built that car.!#@p!#@But if you listen a little closer, you hear the laughter from the team watching the car that we built driving around. “Woah, I can’t believe it! It’s going so fast! It sounds so good!” I can hear my teammates pacing around, watching the car closely.!#@p!#@On one hand, you have the car, a physical manifestation of our work as engineers and the countless hours poured into it. On the other, you have the people, joy, and friendship that was required to get there. For me, MIT Motorsports is a combination of all the things I love most about being at MIT. Working with incredibly talented engineers and scientists to build something cool, partly for fun, partly because of the challenge.!#@p!#@But mostly, it’s because we love what we do and who we do it with.!#@p!#@MIT is a hard place, as any student at Tech knows. Some days are hard to get through and understand why we put ourselves through it. I used to think my dreams would get smaller after I achieved what seemed a lofty dream of attending MIT. But to my dismay, my dreams only got bigger. And on the days that are hard, as there are many, I am guided by the people around me, my team.!#@p!#@The most important lesson that I’ve learned through my time at MIT is that we build things to attain the craft and scientific prowess, but anything worth building takes a village. You need the right village to build a fast racecar. Technical knowledge allows you to accomplish your goal, but people provide the purpose.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/last_photo-1000x667.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NEW_IMG_0456-800x493.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5800-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2639-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5889-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF5492-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ee_on_bench-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF3644-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-1-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-2-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-3-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Telemetry-DR-4-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC01892-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000045080028-800x530.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000045080002-800x530.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000080100027-800x530.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/000026610003-800x530.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/family-1000x750.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4263-2-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/last_photo-1000x667.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/because-racecar-friendships-and-family/
[Guest Post] Take Me *Home* to the Ballgame by Nicole Cooper,By Claire S. '25,by Nicole Cooper,"July 31, 2025","Of all the things to happen in college, I never expected baseball to become the antidote to my homesickness.!#@p!#@I’ve always been a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals—it was practically a requirement to live in the small town I grew up in. But it actually wasn’t until I left Missouri for college that I started following the team as closely as I do today. It’s no coincidence that was also when I started to feel homesick. I was no stranger to being away from home and my family at that point, since I’d gone to overnight camps during my summers for up to three weeks at a time. But something about college felt different.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-10.23.03 AM-1000x740.png]!#@Suddenly, the end date for my stay was years away instead of days or weeks. College was supposed to be my new home, but it was so different from the one I left behind. It was so much bigger, so much busier, so much louder. And no one I knew was there to go through it with me. When my mom left to drive home (yes, all 1200 miles back to Missouri) after my freshman orientation, I broke down crying.!#@p!#@Despite the homesickness, there wasn’t a single moment when I regretted coming to MIT or wished I’d chosen a different college. I knew MIT was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up and that being here was the right thing for me, even if it was unfortunately far from home. Thankfully, over time I learned how to manage the homesickness. I joined clubs where I was able to find a great community of friends. Knowing I had friends I could lean on helped make this place feel more like a home and less like a temporary stop along the way. But another factor that helped me feel more settled was keeping that connection to my hometown, knowing that just because I’d left my home didn’t mean I’d lost it. And I was able to do that through baseball.!#@p!#@Because when I close my eyes, I’m back in the car with my dad, listening to the game on the radio as he drives me back and forth between scholar bowl (think team trivia on steroids), tennis tournaments, and math competitions. I’m back in my grandparents’ house, the game on the TV as we complain about all the decisions we would make differently if we were managing the team. I’m back at weekly dinners with my extended family at Culver’s (if you know you know), the ballgame playing in the background.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-10.23.18 AM-1000x753.png]!#@Maybe you hate baseball (in which case I’d argue you just don’t get it, but that’s a conversation for another time). But whatever it is that connects you to your home, hold onto it. Let it get you through the homesickness, through the times you feel displaced, through the times you just need some sort of comfort. Because those times likely will come—especially if you’re from far away or an environment very different from the city atmosphere of Boston—but they’ll be easier to manage if you have that connection to your hometown to ground you.!#@p!#@After all, college may take you far from home, but it doesn’t have to take home from you.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-10.23.03 AM-1000x740.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-10.23.18 AM-1000x753.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-take-me-home-to-the-ballgame/
"Robots, Space, and the Stories In-Between by Richard O. '28",Using Sci-Fi to Procrastinate,by Richard O. '28,"July 30, 2025","One thing about me is I love science fiction. Whether it be movies, books, shows, or short stories, science fiction always gives me an opportunity to imagine life in a world different than ours and envision what future technology and future societies can look like. I actually talked a little about my science fiction obsession in my MIT applications since sci-fi is part of where I get my inspiration for wanting to be a part of the computer science world. That being said, I’ve found myself indulging and catching up on a lot of science fiction shows that I’ve been saving up during the school year in between my work hours this summer and decided to share a few of my many, many favorites:!#@p!#@Richie Rating: 10⁹/10!#@p!#@Current Status: Finished/Caught Up!#@p!#@Concepts/Themes: Interplanetary Conflicts, Future Societies, Government, Corruption, Time Travel, Math, Technology, Ethics, Cloning, Artificial Intelligence, Space!#@p!#@Richie Analysis: If Star Wars and Dune had a baby, Foundation would be the child. This show is the pinnacle of what science fiction shows should look like. Cinematic production, intriguing storyline, and amazing acting all while bridging together so many different science and space concepts into one beautifully executed show. Basically, some super smart math professor predicts that the entire galaxy is about to enter into a state of chaos for several thousand years but is exiled for his predictions by the sitting empire and tries to gather people to fix things himself. It’s based off of an original novel series by Isaac Asimov with the same name that I have yet to read so I can’t really compare the accuracy of the adaptation, but either way this show is so amazingly well done. Getting to the end of episode 1 is all you need to be hooked on.!#@p!#@Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c!#@p!#@Stills:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051123_Highly_Anticipated_Second_Season_Foundation_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.slideshow_large-800x451.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/8pwrXJ7u58EB4M6hRCaS6H-800x340.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/050725_S3_Premiere_Foundation_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large_-800x451.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Foundation_cineSync_3-800x400.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-204-800x400.png]!#@Richie Rating: 10/10!#@p!#@Current Status: Finished/Caught Up!#@p!#@Concepts/Themes: Artificial Intelligence, Robots, War, Investigation, Emotions, Corruption!#@p!#@Richie Analysis: A beautifully written Japanese animated short series about an investigation into the death of several artificially intelligent robots that exist in a world where AI has reached the same level of intellect as humans. From AI ethics and politics to war and grief, this series has so many amazing layers and character lines that tie into one overarching story that really makes you contemplate a lot of different societal topics.

Essentially a colony of extraterrestrial creatures start overtaking earth and the show follows several different stories of characters all across the globe experiencing the same conflict and slowly begins to merge all their stories together.

Used to watch it with my family and just remember being in awe after each episode. From what I remember the show follows a family on a ship on course to a planet in the Alpha Centauri star system but ends up getting marooned on another planet after their main ship gets damaged. Main character, Will Robinson, meets an AI robot and the show follows the family’s experiences as they try to return to their intended planet.

More of a magical fantasy-based show but is so beautifully produced that it deserves a spot up here. Main character is called Dream, and he essentially controls the dreams of humanity. But on top of that he has a lot of interesting relationships with people in the human world and outside of the human world. A lot of interplay between different mythologies such as Greek and Norse. Most episodes focus on a main plot but some of the more intriguing episodes drift away from it and focus on side characters!#@p!#@Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJXamnPUm0I!#@p!#@Stills:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/the-sandman-netflix-review-1200x675-1-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AAAAQToGvAHI-oMPdgxXtrMnTpW3DettjRLrItNKrZi6v84WL4XrUV-mTdufdR8LuHNbh_YL1Ne71ygaNGS6JW_UOhBngc9geThzZz1o3yVPZWQgNyVE2DQQ4gqsYBX4VGhcWv7LlvcFitWuX3OXOhl9OKNFNho.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/thesandman_season1_00_05_21_06r_wide-9df2dfec3e8d55e17468b5efa34a1a7902ba4d7f-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/the-sandman-desire.avif]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Netflix_The_Sandman_108_Playing_House_02_Jed_The_Corinthian-800x534.webp]!#@Richie Rating: 9/10!#@p!#@Current Status: In progress (on ep 8)!#@p!#@Concepts/Themes: Space Exploration, Survival, Trust, Nature, Artificial Intelligence, Conflict!#@p!#@Richie Analysis: A beautiful animated series about several people who get deserted on a unique planet after using escape pods to get off of their damaged freighter ship.

Anyways: a great story about a dad who goes up into space to get data on some viable alternatives for humanity to replace Earth with after their society began experiencing a mass food shortage. While in space he experiences some drastic time dilation due to different space phenomena, and the movie basically follows the experiences he has as well as those on earth (including his daughter) who experience time a lot faster than him.!#@p!#@Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LqzF5WauAw&t=19s!#@p!#@Stills:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/8a7dd34b09c9c25336a3d850d4c431455e1aaaf0-scaled.avif]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/maxresdefault-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/millers-planet.avif]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2mdvqkw8-1415620078.avif]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nl8KjBO_-_Imgur-800x583.webp]!#@Richie Rating: 9/10!#@p!#@Current Status: In-Progress (on ep8 of s2)!#@p!#@Concepts/Themes: Space Race, NASA, Moon and Mars Exploration, Relationships, Family, Government, Conflict, Decisions, Trauma!#@p!#@Richie Analysis: A well written alternate retelling of the space race between the US and the Soviet Union during the latter half of the 1900s.

Essentially, earth began experiencing a water shortage due to climate change so several scientists are sent up to retrieve a sample of something that could help address it on an abandoned lunar base that experienced some sort of catastrophic event and bring the sample back to earth. Lots of suspense. Lots of mysteries. Great story.

Essentially there’s an intelligent species coming to earth and a ton of random phenomena start happening. And then the intelligent species send these weird VR goggles and start manipulating people’s visions and then manipulating people and then technology and yea. It’s just a crazy show.

This show was alright. Watched the first season with my dad like 2 years ago. Ending of the first season made my jaw drop and I realized like a month ago that they made a second season so I finished watching that. But basically, some aliens leave an artifact on earth so a crew is put together to investigate and follow a signal it produces in hopes that they will uncover its origin. Pretty decent space travel show that shows you all the things that can go wrong in space though the second season was kind of meh.!#@p!#@Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAtBbgtMnZ8!#@p!#@Stills:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/another-life-netflix-review-1200x675-1-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AL101_shot_001-800x422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Another-Life-02-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Zakir1x10-800x394.webp]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Niko_and_William_talk_about_who_was_hooking_up.webp]!#@Richie Rating: 6.8/10!#@p!#@Current Status: In progress (ep5 of s1)!#@p!#@Concepts/Themes: Corporate Society, Memory Auditing, Family, Life Choices, Consciousness, Emotions!#@p!#@Richie Analysis: Unique show that follows these people who opt-in to a procedure at an office for a corporation called Lumon that basically makes them forget all their work memories when they leave the office and all their personal life memories when they re-enter the office.

my hottest STEM takes by Aiden H. '28,actively starting internet wars,by Aiden H. '28,"July 28, 2025","I famously have perfect taste, and with little to do over the summer, I’m left to just sit around and ponder endlessly, refining my taste and opinions indefinitely.!#@p!#@I offer you the following takes with limited to no explanation. Feel free to argue in the comments…I’m ready to defend.!#@p!#@1. Proofs are boring!#@p!#@Don’t you dare show me a mathematical proof. If I care that much, I’ll have the internet explain it to me like I’m five. 90% of things I’m learning very much can be explained in simple words or with common logic. Who is asking to read LaTeX and then going “let’s show this to other people–it makes a lot of sense”?!#@p!#@I’m not saying we shouldn’t have mathematical proofs, I’m just saying that these should not be the ways in which I’m learning something. It should be merely a formality on the way to making something common knowledge.!#@p!#@I choose not to concern myself with the “jth particle” or “nth term”.!#@p!#@I choose happiness.!#@p!#@2. Course 16⁠01 is just Course 2⁠02!#@p!#@This is mostly just out of ignorance, but isn’t 16 just specialized 2? You just do plane mechanics. Also what is mechanical engineering?!#@p!#@3. Organic Chemistry is a great class!#@p!#@Loved it.!#@p!#@4. Pie Charts are good!#@p!#@It is such a valid way to present information, especially demographics and any classification.!#@p!#@5. Φ is pronounced fi, not fee!#@p!#@Why when talking about greek life everyone agrees it’s fi, and then suddenly in physics y’all are switching sides and saying fee.!#@p!#@6. Always put spaces in code!#@p!#@Readability > typing “efficiency” in every case!#@p!#@On that note…!#@p!#@7. I’m not using recursion unless it’s by accident!#@p!#@If I just so happen to have my natural, logical instincts be recursive, then I will write the code that way. I will not sit there thinking about time complexity and memory storage yada yada and drawing a little recursive path on a piece of paper.!#@p!#@If it’s that serious then it either a) has to be done with recursion, so lectures/tutorials/the internet will tell me how or b) it will be edited by ChatGPT to be recursive.!#@p!#@Also I thought recursion was bad-ish.!#@p!#@8. Golgi is pronounced goal-g, not goal-guy!#@p!#@Do NOT disrespect the apparatus like that!#@p!#@9. Mendel’s Laws Are Awfully Named!#@p!#@“Segregation” is a type of “assortment” and it notably has an “independent” nature to it such that the alleles are “segregated” “independently”.!#@p!#@It should just be gametes vs daughter cells.!#@p!#@10. The number 7 should always have a dash when handwritten!#@p!#@11. Matrices are brackets not parentheses!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-3.07.20 PM.png]!#@12. Lim has a cursive l, ln has a print l!#@p!#@Last but not least (if not most important)…!#@p!#@13. Math is blue!#@p!#@science is green, english is yellow, and social studies is red fight me byeee!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-3.07.20 PM.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-hottest-stem-takes/
"My design won an MIT merch contest by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",I don't know why,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","July 23, 2025","Author’s note: The original title was going to be “I DUPED THE COOP!” but I decided that was too much. I still wanted to mention it though.!#@p!#@Back in March, the Harvard/MIT Coop announced their very first merch design competition for the graduating Class of 2025 (that’s me!). Four winners were going to be picked overall, with one undergrad and one grad student from each university. Each of the winners is going to win $500, and four finalists were going to win $100. The objective was to “craft bold, memorable designs that capture the unique spirit of the Class of 2025.”!#@p!#@I’ve thought about making custom merch since freshman year, but I’ve just been too lazy to start. So when I got the email from the Coop, I knew it was my calling. This was the universe telling me to go for it and make my dreams come true.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_mit_shirt-400x400.png]!#@Under the “What inspired you to draw your design” question in the submission form, I wrote some bullshit about how I wanted to capture the complexities of the Class of 2025 experience: coming out of the COVID lockdown and right into college, not knowing what to do after graduation, realizing that your friends are moving away, waiting for grad school decisions, etc.!#@p!#@I wrote all that because it’d be funny to write a serious justification for whatever the heck this was supposed to be. I didn’t expect to win; that wasn’t really my goal. All I wanted was to make somebody on the judges’ panel laugh, or at least mutter a perplexed “…what?”!#@p!#@Turns out, I’m not the only one with an odd taste in graphic design.!#@p!#@I got this email in the middle of a media studies class I was taking. I had to excuse myself to go the restroom so I wouldn’t interrupt the class discussion about online privacy with my idiotic laughter.!#@p!#@Mind you, the Harvard/MIT Coop sells official Harvard/MIT merchandise. Visitors from all over the world come into their stores, so I’d imagine it’s important for them to capture the essence of their respective universities. But now, the MIT Coop had to figure out how to publicize this neurotic rat-animal-thing along with their usual selection of merch. Boy, they tried.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150338_Instagram-800x941.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150415_Instagram-800x1378.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150529_Gallery-800x1107.jpg]!#@When I went to pick up my $500 check, I expected them to go “haha SIKE!” and then laugh me out of the building. Nothing happened, and I successfully deposited my check. That money probably came from an innocent alum who thought they were supporting a library or something meaningful like that. It found its way into my hands instead, and a week later I spent a part of it on GTA IV.!#@p!#@I really want to know what the judges were thinking when they made me a winner. Did they not get enough submissions? Did they want to prank the Board of Directors and the general public? Or did they see something in this vulnerable and anxious creature that they resonated with?!#@p!#@To be fair, I wasn’t entirely lying in the submission form. I’ve tried writing a senior year post that would wrap up my personal college experience, but every attempt ends up going on and on about how I should’ve done things differently. I guess I’m not alone in this post-graduation ambivalence though, because whenever I showed this drawing to my friends, they would say something like “IT’S BEAUTIFUL” but then end with “God, I feel that though.”!#@p!#@Don’t get me wrong, I’ve also made fond memories at MIT. However, it can feel disappointing to not get the story-book college experience that I hoped for. But this is one of those fond memories, and I get to brag that I designed official MIT merch. Props to the Coop for taking a chance on my ugly, yet endearing, creation.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_mit_shirt-400x400.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150338_Instagram-800x941.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150415_Instagram-800x1378.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot_20250723_150529_Gallery-800x1107.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-design-won-an-mit-merch-contest/

how to be a microcelebrity by Janet G. '27,"or micro-microcelebrity, or micro-micro-microcelebrity, or...",by Janet G. '27,"July 18, 2025","I’m not very good at impulse management. In my last (real) post, I spent like 15 hours writing ⁠01 about the food I ate for a solid month. At the end of it, I admitted defeat:!#@p!#@… and proceeded to fall into a food coma for the entire spring semester. ⁠02 Anyway, spring came and went, we’re now in the middle of summer, and last night I couldn’t sleep until 3am because I hit a critical mass of a desire to write. So here I am. Hello again!!#@p!#@I knew I wanted to write something, but in my flurry of thoughts last night ideas kept on popping up and getting knocked down. So as a bit of a cop-out and hopefully a new jumpstart, this blog will be about how and why you might want to blog and become the microcelebrity of your dreams. Meta, I know.!#@p!#@For some background, I’ve barely written anything blog-like over the past half year for a multitude of reasons, mostly enumerated below.!#@p!#@But here I am, writing about myself on a public platform, and planning on writing more.!#@p!#@Why?!#@p!#@Because I think blogging is worth it, and I think maybe you should consider it too.!#@p!#@Blogging, as I’ll define it, is about jotting down personal thoughts/takes, and then putting them out into the world via one platform or another. If you jot down personal thoughts and keep them to yourself, that’s called journaling. If you jot down something that isn’t personal thoughts and then put them out into the world, that’s like, propaganda or something.!#@p!#@I think there are primarily three classes of benefits that come with blogging: personal, professional, and social.!#@p!#@I think personal benefits are the most important, because they stand independent of any external validation/feedback that you might get. In any case, even if you write something and you only show it to a few friends/family members, it’s worth it. These benefits also apply obviously to journalling, so if your privacy concerns are too high for you to count blogging as worth it, you should just journal instead.!#@p!#@1) Blogging helps you record down experiences and thoughts for later.!#@p!#@You get to remember what past you cared about; there’s also something so idyllic about recalling the ‘good old times.’ You also get to review past mistakes that you made, and try not to make them again. I love reading old diary entries for this reason — how I’d felt petty against some kid who had laughed at my lack of loom bands, the little games I played with my siblings, the first time I took the courage to go to the local dairy and buy a 2 dollar ice block. I still read the letters to my past selves over the past few years, feeling bittersweet and relieved about things that happened and did not.!#@p!#@2) Blogging helps you make thoughts legible and synthesize ideas in the context of your own life.!#@p!#@I think many of the MIT blogs are great examples of this: I’ll reference Aiden H. ‘28 and Allison E. ‘27’s blogs here, although I know many many other bloggers have done the same. ⁠04 Allison’s recent blog on life tokens captures such a lovely idea about living life to the fullest; Aiden’s blog about boringness captures a different but similarly meaningful idea about being content with what is already here. Both of them made me think a lot, and they capture these ideas in grounded little snapshots in a way that made them stick in my mind. I was not lucky enough to write those blogs, but I have had a similar case with my blog about instagram and choosing to not engage with social media. I can tell you for sure that it made me think more deeply about the life I’m living.!#@p!#@Beyond these personal benefits, I think professional and social benefits are also pretty important and tend to scale up with audience.!#@p!#@3) Blogging helps you with articulating and communicating ideas that you otherwise might loosely understand!#@p!#@The Feynman Technique is a pretty famous learning technique. There’s also the trick for asking questions on forums, which is that you ask a question, and then give a bad answer for it on the forum. Other people are more likely to correct a bad answer than be the first to give an answer, ⁠05 so in the same way, if you write a blog on some concept, you could also get good clarifications on the ideas because you’ve put your understanding out there for other people to correct.!#@p!#@4) Blogging helps you meet people you resonate with!!#@p!#@There’s a quote that I think is really funny, but is also really true: “everything is a dating app if you try hard enough.” Of course, I’m not saying that you should write a blog so that you can pull. You can do that if you want I guess? But the more generalisable observation is that if you think about dating apps as a way to just meet people you might like, blogs are a way for you to meet people you resonate with. You get to showcase your thoughts, and people who resonate with your thoughts might reach out, in which case new friendships and relationships (;D) just may as well bloom! Henrik Karlsson, an essayist who writes a lot about meta-blogging, has a great post about this.!#@p!#@5) Pleasant surprises!#@p!#@Something similar but not quite identical to the previous idea is that you can get pleasant surprises. These can include interesting people, but also the occasionally cute fan-mail and old friend who texts you about a blog you write. I remember everyone who has reached out to me about my blogs before — whether emails, comments, in-person or otherwise — and I am always grateful to each and every one of you <3!#@p!#@6) Fame, income, career… a book deal… eternal legacy blah blah blah!#@p!#@Alright, we all can dream. But this is a possibility, no matter how slim!!#@p!#@1) Too much effort!#@p!#@Sure. Writing takes time; if you’re going to write something that the public might see, it’s probably worth a look-over and proof-reading before you put it out. That takes time and effort, and when you have school/work/other life stuff, it makes sense to deprioritize blogs. But I do think it’s worth it to do hard things, and things expand to fill the time you give it. I’ve been doing some private daily writing with a few friends, and it’s been great for helping me write without burning myself out again.!#@p!#@2) Loss of privacy!#@p!#@This is a fair concern. Scrapers can take your content and let people use this against you; you should probably also not share all of your thoughts online for both professional reasons and otherwise. I also worried a lot about scrapers taking my content; at some point, I think I just realized that I was probably losing way more data than a few blogs, so on net the benefits are probably more worth it.!#@p!#@3) AI slop!#@p!#@This was a surprisingly big reason that contributed to my inactivity. I felt a little tired of all the AI slop that I was reading everywhere. What do you mean I can’t use my elegant em-dash without being taken for ChatGPT anymore? Is there any point in writing work you want to be seen if it’s just going to be drowned out by people literally churning AI slop out by the day? It’s pretty upsetting. Until I thought about some pieces I used to like a lot, and then realised that they were also slop in a different way. There’s already plenty of bad writing out there; you can’t escape it. Also, this is hopefully liberating in the sense that you can sleep soundly knowing that even if your writing is shit, there’s probably worse shit out there that people are somehow reading and praising anyway.!#@p!#@4) Over-narrativization!#@p!#@I talked to Kayode D. ‘27 about this a lot; a pit people who write too much can fall into is “too much writing, not enough living.” Spending too much time in your head does things to you. Sometimes you should focus on living life in the present rather than trying to document everything, and sometimes you should not live life just to fulfill a specific narrative. Andrew, a good friend of mine and one of the best writers I (personally) know, has some good notes about this.!#@p!#@If you think maybe the benefits are worth the potential costs, here are a couple of ways to get started with blogging.!#@p!#@If you don’t know what to write about, there’s a lot of blog prompts out there. Streams of consciousness are okay; just feel free to record whatever you were thinking about. If there’s any concepts that you want to understand better, you can also spend time writing about that.!#@p!#@If you feel insecure about your ideas, you can also just treat blogging as a way for friends to keep in touch with you. Back when I kept a private blog, my friends would respond and comment and it was a really lovely way to keep in touch. Once you get over the activation energy of your first blog, the other blogs may be easier than you think.!#@p!#@Blogging for MIT admissions has been one of the best things I’ve done in college. The benefits are numerous:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-11.54.24 PM-1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-1.08.59 AM-800x181.png]!#@With that said, you should not apply to blog with admissions if…!#@p!#@Otherwise, why not? Use the application as an excuse to write some stuff down and recognise how rich and interesting your life is.!#@p!#@Anyway, I had a lot of fun writing this. I might start writing again when I have time, but in the meantime this blog has persuaded me that I should start genuinely writing again. I think I’m literally just pent up with not journalling OR blogging OR essaying for the past couple months, because I’ve been busy writing briefs and long ass slack messages or whatever.!#@p!#@If you’ve made it to the end of this, congrats! Thanks for reading — I am always grateful for the infinite series of coincidences that lead my words to other people. I hope to come across yours one day :)!#@p!#@And perhaps, just perhaps… I’ll see you in The Office ⁠09 one day!!#@p!#@Additional notes:!#@p!#@I wrote this, and then while proofreading, realised that in fact Vincent H. ‘23 wrote about like exactly this on his blog a couple weeks ago. And that I had read it. Whatever ideas overlap here is possibly a convergence but more likely reframed from his piece; you should read his piece too! https://mindslice.substack.com/p/what-is-the-point-of-blogging!#@p!#@Henrik Karlsson has some great advice here: https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/start-a-blog!#@p!#@There’s a lot of blogging advice out there. This is an opinion piece, so please feel free to get other opinions on blogging (although you will be biased towards people who decided to write in the first place, so try and just talk to your friends too).!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-11.54.24 PM-1.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-1.08.59 AM-800x181.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-be-a-microcelebrity/
Day in the Life of a MIT Mechanical Engineering UROP Student by Kayode D. '27,I built an underwater robot :p,by Kayode D. '27,"July 14, 2025","One of the coolest things at MIT is how easily undergrads can join research through UROPs (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program). I did my first one this past semester and finished it over the summer, working in Professor David Wallace’s lab. Alongside a grad student named Chuck, I helped design underwater robots for students at a university in Portugal. Here’s a quick look at some highlights from the project—and what a random day⁠01 might’ve looked like!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ROV-Final-1400x933.jpg]!#@The biggest challenge in this was that they did not have the labs and equipment we have, so if it breaks it needs to be repairable with Home Depot parts.!#@p!#@9:38 – Wake up really late because my alarm didn’t go off.!#@p!#@This summer, I’m staying at ET, an off-campus fraternity. What’s really interesting is that while everyone has a room to put their stuff in, almost no one sleeps in them. Instead, everyone sleeps on the third floor of the house, in a giant room with bunk beds like at a summer camp. It is kept dark and quiet 24/7 to not disturb anyone’s sleeping, and we use vibrating alarm clocks to wake up. I unfortunately set mine incorrectly and did not wake up on time. Whoops.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF0031-800x611.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF0015-800x611.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF0022-800x611.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF0023-800x611.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSCF0012-800x611.jpg]!#@10:00 – I BlueBike over to MIT Campus!#@p!#@As MIT students, we get a discount on the Boston bike share system, called BlueBikes. For $50 a year, you get unlimited rides on the bikes around Boston and Cambridge. This is an absolute STEAL for when the T doesn’t go where you need and you don’t have a car. [Having a car on campus is pretty impractical unless you’ve got a frat parking spot. Otherwise, parking is expensive and unnecessary most things you need are within walking/biking/train distance.]!#@p!#@10:30 – Meet up with my advisor, Chuck.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cadlab-gyro-pic.jpg]!#@Here’s the problems we were having:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Doombot-diagram-one-3-800x724.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Doombot-Drift-Diagram-800x645.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wings-diagram-800x754.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/didnt-work-png-800x754.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-drawing-2-800x600.png]!#@When the ROV propels forward, a torque is put on the system causing it to flip over and drift upwards. My first idea didn’t work the way I expected it to, and we still wanted to do something to counteract the torque. So what did I do?!#@p!#@11:00 – I HIT THE BOOKS!!!!#@p!#@I went to Barker Library to research ROVs and how designers counteract this problem. Most ROVs have the motors places in line with the COM, so they don’t really have this problem.!#@p!#@Thinking back, I remembered a lecture from last semester’s 2.007 class, Design and Manufacturing. Professor Amos Winter talked about how he designed a new fan blade for XYZ company when he was younger. He had no clue how fan blades worked, but he knew he could research airplane wings, and that led him to his design that increased air flow by a good amount!!#@p!#@I had tried this approach, researching how tail wings on an airplane and rudders on big ships work:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/plane-diagram-one-800x934.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wing-diagram-two-800x934.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rudder-three-800x934.png]!#@So I researched how they worked and made a design for new “wings” to add to the robot.!#@p!#@From this and measurements of the ROV, I was able to make a design for the rudders [which I drew onto the sheet metal and is now on the robots halfway across the world. Sorry I didn’t take a picture…].!#@p!#@12:30 – Lunch at Chipotle!#@p!#@Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of food on campus during the summer. You have to walk a little ways out to the Chipotle by Kendall Square, or Roxy’s Grilled Cheese⁠05 up Mass Ave.!#@p!#@I ran into my friend, Isa J. ‘27, at Chipotle. I don’t remember what we talked about, it was a month ago. I think we talked about having a bonfire⁠06 with whoever was still on campus at some point. It never happened.⁠07!#@p!#@1:15 PM – Go to Pappalardo to make part!#@p!#@Pappalardo is one of the biggest Mechanical Engineering makerspaces on campus, and it’s where 2.007 is held in the spring semesters. I’ve tried making sheet metal parts at other places on campus, but none come close to the speed at which I can iterate and create at Pappalardo. This is thanks to the three horsemen of my fabocalypse: The Shear, Break, and Punch.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/spongebob-pappa-bow-meme.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pappa-machines.jpg]!#@Most makerspaces have bandsaws and drill presses for woodworking, but few are set up to cut sheet metal at the thickness I needed. But with these tools, you don’t even need electricity! It’s powered by sheer will…and the shear will, too!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wings-two.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wings-one.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wings-four.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/empty-papa-1.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bears-AHHHHH-1.jpg]!#@2:00 PM – Time to test!!#@p!#@I met back up with Chuck at the Alumni Swimming pool to test out the ROV.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doombot-ethernet.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/clearbot-cart.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doombot-cam.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doombot-pool.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doombot-coords-800x1067.jpg]!#@The rudders work great! Yippee!!#@p!#@4:00 – I clean up and go home!!!#@p!#@While I’m rinsing off the ROV, an older gentleman mentions to me that he used to do testing in the Alumni pool when he was an undergrad. I asked what he was testing.!#@p!#@His name is Dave Schloerb. His senior thesis was designing a speaker to be used underwater by divers to communicate. He told me that it didn’t work perfectly and that the thesis likely does not exist online, so I probably couldn’t read it. It was a really interesting conversation, though.!#@p!#@Later on, I looked him up online to see if I could find his work.!#@p!#@Excuse me??? Dave Schloerb is the GOAT????!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-13-214546-2.png]!#@In 1974, Dave submitted an article to Skin Diver Magazine which you can read here. When he was in high school, he wanted to spend 24 hours at the bottom of the lake near his house. So with the help of a buddy, he constructed a two room base out of oil drums and scrap metal. Using a pump and hose to pipe water down to the base [dubbed “Julius”], he started his time spent in the murky depths. Read on to see how things turned out for our hero!!#@p!#@He went on to do projects for a diving company after college and came back to get a masters, continuing his pursuits with underwater engineering. Literally so cool.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@MIT is so cool. Like obviously it’s a cool place, but what CJ Q. ‘23 said is also true. The best part of MIT is the people. People here get curious about something and actually go build it, test it, break it, and try again. I don’t think I fully understood that in high school, but I’m glad I can be here now. And you don’t have to be creating underwater bunkers in high school to belong at a place like MIT, heck I was making board games out of cardboard in high school. But those sort of passions can be applied and reapplied to future ideas and pursuits, and it makes these super cool things. Whether it’s building a robot, designing an egg incubator out of a trash can, or figuring out how to wake up with a vibrating alarm, there’s room for all of it.!#@p!#@Maybe I’ll try to get coffee with Dave this fall.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@We also tested the robot in the Charles river later that week:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bot-charles-river.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dock-doombot.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/foggy-charles.jpg]!#@As of right now, the ROVs are being used in Portugal in the program!

Tour of an MIT student’s notebook by Anika H. '26,my brain is a mess so my pages have everything,by Anika H. '26,"July 8, 2025","Note: This is not a guide to keeping a notebook because everyone has their own style of taking notes and keeping organized. But if you’re looking to start keeping a little notebook or everything and have no idea where to start, feel free to use this as inspiration.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notebook-400x533.jpg]!#@Historically, I’ve only ever finished three notebooks out of the dozens I’ve had over the years, including the most recent one. The first was a composition notebook filled with spelling practices from elementary school. The second was a multipurpose notebook that I handcrafted and bound in 8th grade, filled with sketches, diary entries, and brainstorming. My most recently completed one, which I finished a month ago is also multipurpose, though far more technical with more diverse content.!#@p!#@It has everything has notes from all my classes, doodles from any TTRPGs I happen to be playing, notes from my summer internships, sketches, technical drawings, and scrapbooking.!#@p!#@Obviously, it’s impractical to take a picture of each and every the 100+ pages I’ve scrawled across, so what you’re getting will just be the highlights. The brown colored pages are from the completed notebook, and the white dotted pages are from the current one I’m using right now.!#@p!#@Diagrams and Technical drawings!#@p!#@If I had to pick, this is my favorite part of my notebook. I use CAD (Solidworks, Fusion360, OnShape) for different projects, but because drawing is way faster for me, I like to sketch it out first to get the rough shape and dimensions down and also have a preliminary design to get feedback on.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-1-scaled-e1751927091500-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-3-800x1190.jpg]!#@Class Notes!#@p!#@My notes vary from day to day depending on everything from my interest in the subject, the pace of the lecture, how much sleep I’ve gotten the previous night, and how nice the ink pen I’m using feels on the page. Especially for technical classes, I like to include diagrams to help with understanding. They’re not the best notes to give a friend when they miss class and want to catch up on what happened, but they’re good enough to be helpful for psets and test review.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-1-800x1121.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-2-800x583.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-5-800x1119.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-4-800x1128.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-3-800x608.jpg]!#@I will also keep note of things that confuse me by writing little footnotes and such around that actual content.

The main way I was able to finish my notebook was by accepting that it was not going to be neat and ✨aesthetic✨ the entire way through.

My new notebook has a table of contents, which is really really nice, but I was too lazy to make one for my old notebook.!#@p!#@Contact information: If you plan on keeping a notebook or sketchbook of any kind, you should write down your name and contact information on the first page in case it gets lost. I know from experience that losing a sketchbook you’ve worked hard on is one of the most devastating things that can happen to an artist. It’s not that much different for notebooks, especially if it has all your class notes.!#@p!#@My preferred writing implement: I don’t use pencil for my notes when I can help it. I like the finality of using an ink pen and enjoy leaving a record of my mistakes, not to mention it shows up better on the page and doesn’t fade.!#@p!#@My pen of choice is the 0.1mm Pigma Micron pen. It uses archival ink, so the ink doesn’t bleed when it gets wet or fade over time. It flows wonderfully, and the only problem I’ve encountered is that the tip is fairly fragile. When I drop the pen on it’s tip, it either splits into two or leans on its side, making thicker, more inconsistent lines. For finer details, I use the 0.05mm one, though the lines are too thin for notetaking and the tip will shrink back into the metal support if I push too hard on the page over a period of time. When available, I use white gel pens for highlights on my drawings.!#@p!#@Ballpoint pens are ew. Still prefer them to pencil though.!#@p!#@Holding the book together: My old notebook has a button clasp and my new one has a rubber band attached to the back to hold it shut. Many of my pages have come loose, so it’s nice to have a way of keeping everything together. When it’s bouncing around in your backpack with laptops, books, and all the rest of your stuff, keeping it shut will prevent pages from folding and tearing out.!#@p!#@If by your last page you have formed an emotional attachment to your notebook, you’ll know that you’ve kept it well.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-4-400x400.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notebook-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-1-scaled-e1751927091500-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/technical-3-800x1190.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-1-800x1121.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-2-800x583.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-5-800x1119.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-4-800x1128.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/notes-3-800x608.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/quips-1-800x629.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/quips-2-800x557.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scratch-3-800x1144.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scratch-2-800x1195.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scratch-1-800x1229.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/planning-2-800x913.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/brainstorm-2-800x481.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/extra-notes-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-15-800x795.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-13-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-7-800x1040.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-12-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-3-scaled-e1751927698192-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-10-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-5-800x815.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-8-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-2-800x946.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-11-800x435.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-14.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-9-800x376.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrapbook-1-800x1188.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrapbook-4-scaled-e1751928201440-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrapbook-2-800x1175.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrapbook-5-800x646.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/scrapbook-3-800x1086.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/brainstorm-1-800x1177.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/poetry-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/art-4-400x400.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/tour-of-an-mit-students-notebook/
Life Tokens by Allison E. '27,the currency of joy,by Allison E. '27,"July 6, 2025","When I was younger, one of my favorite board games to play with my family was “The Game of Life.” It’s a bit like the mobile game BitLife, I suppose. You start as a young adult, and walk along the pathways of life–choosing a career, getting married, having kids, getting promoted (or fired), buying a house, and eventually retiring. The goal is to collect as much money as possible over the course of your life. There’s a bunch of different squares that you might land on–some are “payday” squares, some are “lawsuit” squares, and some just involve random actions like paying taxes or donating to a charity. Sometimes, though, you land on a “LIFE” square. Each of these squares represents an interesting life experience–maybe you visit the Grand Canyon, maybe you host a family reunion, maybe you break a world record.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/91XSa1fIoTL._AC_SL1500_-800x540.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/s-l1200-800x600.jpg]!#@More importantly, though, when you land on these squares, you also get to pick up a life token⁠01 , which you cash out at the end of the game in exchange for money–$10,000, $20,000, even $50,000, equivalent to the payday salary of a “computer designer” in-game.!#@p!#@The reason that The Game of Life has to quantify life experiences as money is just game mechanics– the game rules determine the winner by amount of money.⁠02 But I think it’s a value system that has truth even outside the rules of the game.!#@p!#@Right now, while we’re young, there’s plenty of short term gain from interesting life experiences–joy, new knowledge, friendship, etc. Sixty years from now, though, the ability to look back on all the interesting life experiences we’ve had will be all the more valuable to us when we’re all retired, our friends and family have dispersed, and our bodies are too worn out to do much. If/when I turn 80, how much money would I give up to have the memories and experience of cooking a sixteen-dish Thanksgiving with ten college friends? Honestly, probably at least $2,000. How much to have dragged 24 pumpkins through the streets of Boston? Maybe $300. How much to have investigated possible arson in Burton-Conner after a 4:00 am fire alarm? Probably at least $500.!#@p!#@I’ve spent the past year or so living by this philosophy. Shenanigans are worth it not only for the joy in the moment, but also for the value of their memories later in life. It’s led me to incredible tomfoolery–building a snow fort at 3:00 am, howling at the moon in Central Park, chasing the aurora at Tufts on a random Thursday. Each of these memories is worth more to me than most of the objects I own, but we don’t have a good system to value experiences the way we do objects. So I think about them as life tokens, and I collect as many as I can.!#@p!#@P.S. I once convinced a friend, Ojas G. ‘27, to snort a line of li-hing powder⁠03 using the life token argument. At first, we were going to pay him $5 to do it, but I managed to convince him that it would be worth at least $100 in life tokens when he was retired and reliving the good old days, and he agreed to do it. I stand by the truth of that claim. He might not 😆!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/91XSa1fIoTL._AC_SL1500_-800x540.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/s-l1200-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/life-tokens/

To ASE Or Not To ASE by Aiden H. '28,preparing academically for freshman year,by Aiden H. '28,"June 26, 2025","It’s June! Which means of course you’re not interested in the graduating seniors, or Hank Green’s commencement address, or all the cool things people are doing over the summer–you’re interested in me, because I just finished my freshman year, and what a scary and tumultuous time it was! Nonetheless, it is done.!#@p!#@Looking back to last summer, everything I questioned about coming into MIT is absolutely not all what I should have been concerned about. Tragically, I see my peers falling into the same trap. On r/mit,⁠01 all of the prefrosh seem to be freaking out over imposter syndrome/is MIT too hard/am I smart enough to be here. And while I do see validity in these questions, what I think is more important is how they answered–instead of answering yes/no, I think simply understanding the class system and the choices you have freshman year will clarify what academic situations you can find yourself in (not just “am I smart enough to be in it”).!#@p!#@Allow me to half-explain/half-give advice on academic preparation for your freshman year.!#@p!#@PNR!#@p!#@This is the simplest and most commonly known, so we’ll start here!!#@p!#@Freshman fall, all classes are taken on PNR, or Pass/No Record. This means that if you get a passing grade (70-100) it will show up on your transcript as simply a P for pass. No it doesn’t matter if you got a 71 or a 99, it will be exactly the same. If you receive a failing grade, it simply won’t show up at all (there will be “no record”). These classes do not contribute to your GPA.!#@p!#@Freshman spring you will start earning letter grades for passing that do affect GPA, but you still will have NR if you fail a class. Failing grades only “count” starting sophomore year.!#@p!#@This should take a lot of the burden off of your shoulders, because you simply won’t need to meet the same standards freshman fall that you did in high school. Yes, MIT is harder than high school, but getting a 60 on a test won’t be the end of the world in the same way. Also, if you’re curious about your academic abilities in these upper-level classes, you literally have a trial period to assess yourself so you know where you should place yourself in classes moving forward.!#@p!#@ASEs are exams taken before every registration season that allow students to test out and receive credit for a class by taking the final for that subject. Scores for ASEs do show up on transcripts but do not affect GPA. ASEs can be taken during any year at MIT, but are most common entering freshman fall because ASEs also fall under PNR.!#@p!#@Some ASEs are known to be more difficult than others. 5.111⁠03 is known to have a much lower pass rate than tests like 6.100A.⁠04 This shouldn’t entirely scare you, though, because most of this is external factors (the average MIT student knows more code than college chemistry). The biggest thing to be aware of is how different the ASE is from high school/prior content. 5.111 notably covers content that is not included in AP or IB chemistry, while 18.01 is pretty similar to AP Calc BC. Depending on the test you want to take, you might need to learn new content on your own. No matter what, you should study before.!#@p!#@Now the bigger question: should you even take an ASE, and if so, how many?!#@p!#@In my opinion (which is not fact and not the only one you should refer to), this is how you should approach taking an ASE:!#@p!#@I have extreme interest in this topic and have already taken a similar college-level class — Go for it! You have nothing to lose on PNR, you like the subject, and it wouldn’t be a time suck because you already know a decent amount.!#@p!#@I have taken an AP/IB equivalent and think the class would mostly be review — Take it if you want, but study before and review the test content to see if you’ve actually covered it all before.!#@p!#@I hate this subject and don’t want to spend a semester learning it — This is fair and a common reason for taking an ASE. Go for it if you have a lot of spare time, but remember that you’re still learning the content either way. Is it worth your summer studying something you don’t like instead of taking it with friends later on?!#@p!#@I haven’t taken this class but I think I should so I look smart and can get as far ahead as possible and get started on senior-level classes ASAP — Don’t.!#@p!#@While ASEs seem like a great thing (they can be!), there is something to be said about taking these classes with your peers. Being too studious can bar you from everything else that makes college and MIT special. There was always something fun about walking out of my dorm at 7:00 PM to go to a physics exam and seeing 700 other students trek across campus at the same time, all knowing we were about to go through the exact same pain at the same time, and then hearing everyone on the way back gossip about the answers and that one proctor who was really annoying for no reason etc. etc.!#@p!#@My biggest piece of advice: don’t try and go crazy on the ASEs just cause. There are so many people who have to take every single GIR, and are still just as successful and smart as everyone else here. Yes, you will graduate on time–the majors are designed to be that way.!#@p!#@For me, I’m going to MIT so I can go into biotech, not physics research–there’s no reason I should be a physics genius before having taken the classes (or the bio/chem classes, too, considering I’m here to learn and therefore should not expect myself to know everything that I’m going to be taught in my major).!#@p!#@There is very very little shame here that I’ve experienced. Everyone has a collective understanding that we’re cracked nerds, so we don’t walk around flexing about AP/SAT scores or what we self-studied. In fact, I feel like I talk about academic validation so much less than I did in high school because I know everyone here is smart and just trying their best. No one will praise you if you take an ASE. No one will shame you if you take a slower-paced class. You’ll be fine nonetheless.!#@p!#@Math/Physics Prep!#@p!#@By far most people freak out that they don’t fit the “math genius” standards of MIT students in popular culture. I’m here to tell you that you don’t need to know the graph theory from Good Will Hunting or win the MIT Integration Bee to be adept enough for MIT math.!#@p!#@As a part of the GIRs, everyone must take 18.01,⁠05 18.02,⁠06 8.01⁠07 , and 8.02.⁠08 Unlike potential expectations/assumptions, most students will take these classes. It is rare to meet someone who knows all the material of the classes already for two reasons: 1) Most people don’t have access to/don’t spend the time studying ahead in these subjects in high school, and 2) The MIT version of these subjects (8.01 and 8.02 specifically) are notably harder and involve more complex foundational math. The most common class to have tested/placed out of is 18.01 through an ASE or a 5 on AP Calc BC (a 2009 newsletter said about 1/2 of the freshman class does–however, I don’t know if this is still true). From there, a handful test out of 18.02 or 8.01, and even fewer test out of 8.02. If this is you, that’s beautiful! I, and many many other students didn’t!#@p!#@To make things even more confusing, these classes come in ~flavors~. Each class has a regular and an “advanced” version (e.g. 8.01 and 8.012). The “advanced” version is typically much more mathematically rigorous with a focus on proofs, but covers the same content and counts for the same credit. (Before you ask, no, taking the advanced version does not make you cooler, it just means you might have a harder time or you really really love the math behind Newtonian Mechanics). The vast majority of students will opt for the “regular” version.!#@p!#@18.01 and 8.01 also include slower-paced versions (18.01L and 8.01L) for students with no prior experience or students who find the grueling pace of your first semester to be easily fixable with these versions. These classes continue into IAP⁠09 and have that extra month to spread out content over. People on the outside of MIT assume we judge when people do/want to learn at a slower pace, which is absolutely not true. Every single time I’ve heard 8.01L come up in conversation, it has never been “oh my god are you stupid why aren’t you good at physics” and has always been “I should’ve taken 8.01L, too”.!#@p!#@So where should you start? You’ll talk with your advisor when you register for classes, and I should of course not be the only person you take advice on this from, but if you ask me:!#@p!#@Physics!#@p!#@If you like physics and got a 5 on both AP Physics C exams: Take 8.02 or 8.022!#@p!#@If you don’t like physics/forgot it all and don’t know how in the world you got two fives: Take 8.01 or 8.012!#@p!#@If you take AP Physics 1 or 2, or didn’t get two fives: Take 8.01!#@p!#@If you’ve never taken any physics: Take 8.01L or 8.01!#@p!#@Calculus!#@p!#@If you like math and got a 5 on AP Calculus BC: Take 18.02!#@p!#@If you don’t like math/forgot it all/don’t know how you got a 5: Take 18.01A/18.02A (good if you don’t want to completely restart but also don’t want to jump straight into multi)!#@p!#@If you only took AP Calc AB, didn’t get a 5 in BC, or would just feel better learning it again: 18.01!#@p!#@If you’ve never taken calculus: Take 18.01 or 18.01L!#@p!#@tl;dr you’ll be great!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/to-ase-or-not-to-ase/
alone in cologne by Veronica P. '27,"homesickness, better late than never",by Veronica P. '27,"June 26, 2025","I counted today, and since freshman year orientation I have said goodbye to my parents ten times.!#@p!#@The first time they dropped me off at MIT, my mom couldn’t contain her tears. Holding my hand, she was the only one of us truly overcome with sadness. She’d squeeze tighter and tighter, as if enough pressure would coax the misery out, but, for all she tried, the moment refused to hit me. Almost accusingly, I remember, she pivoted towards my dad, “How can you not be upset? Are you not going to miss her?”!#@p!#@“Of course I’m going to miss her, but why would I be sad? I’m too excited for her.”!#@p!#@My dad had moved even further for college. After qualifying for a scholarship program, he traveled from Venezuela to Germany without knowing a single German sentence. As a student, he could only afford to call his family once a month— a drastic change for a sixteen year old. (He spent my entire childhood swearing it was fifteen, but after his fortieth retelling or so my sister and I gathered enough skepticism to do the math)!#@p!#@If I had to guess, there are a number of reasons he revisits the experience so often. Anytime I felt too scared, too young, too out of my comfort zone, he would use his story to convince me that I was capable of more than I believed. He always seemed to look back on his German years as one of the best periods of his life. From a young age, my sister and I were raised with his itch to travel, with that sense of independence and exploration. For my dad, watching me leave Texas was like watching everything he had ever wanted for me come true.!#@p!#@And every goodbye since, for both of my parents, has mirrored the emotions of that very first time. This tenth one, however, was particularly sentimental; inspired by my dad, I’ve set off to intern in Germany for the summer!!#@p!#@Back home, my little sister is preparing to go to college herself. Not to be outdone, she’s moving out of state as well. She’s one of the bravest people I know, but even so, it’s hard not to see the fear in her. She’s closer to my parents than I was at her age; since visiting me in February, she’s struggled to stomach the idea of leaving home. Recently, I tried to tap back into how I felt when I was in her shoes. For some reason, I couldn’t remember being nearly as scared.!#@p!#@Perhaps that’s because, for the most part, I’ve always held the same mindset as my dad. I remember not feeling as homesick as many of my friends freshman year, I was too caught up in the novelty that was right in front of me. If anything, I wasted no time in applying to MISTI, in finding ways to spend my breaks even further away from Texas. When I reflect on my adventures, I’m quick to recall that sense of accomplishment, the thrill of having ventured out into the unknown.!#@p!#@But that thrill has to be earned somehow. It has to be earned through fear. If I dig a little deeper, into the less savory parts of my memory, I can recall those nights of crying to my mom on the couch, of slipping into accidental tears over FaceTime.!#@p!#@And while this is my tenth goodbye, my third MISTI adventure, this time around the fear feels more acute. I’ve called my parents more in the past week than I usually do over an entire month. I thought I was immune to homesickness, and here I am, feeling it two years too late. My previous MISTI’s have been no longer than three weeks, in countries where I had a better grasp of the language and culture. Here, I feel uncharacteristically hesitant to venture out on my own: certain I’ll miss some social cue, certain I’ll come into harm’s way.!#@p!#@Despite this, my dad’s encouragement has its permanent place in the back of my mind. I trust that if I lean into the fear, I’ll ultimately be glad I did. I remember as a kid, he’d drag me onto rollercoaster after rollercoaster. During the line, I’d watch the ride and knot my stomach around every single loop; I’d beg him to let us turn around, try to convince him that this next ride was truly too much for me. But without fail, by the time we lifted our seatbelts, I was always exclaiming “that was AWESOME!” and racing to ride again.!#@p!#@So, last Sunday, I set off without my roommate to take a day trip to Cologne. At lunch, I sat behind another American girl, also a table for one. When the waiter arrived with our plates, I found that we had ordered the same exact dish. My phone buzzed with messages from my parents. Maybe I wasn’t so alone, after all.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/alone-in-cologne/
the fear and delight of fire spinning by Anika H. '26,do not this at home! I am a trained (semi?)professional.,by Anika H. '26,"June 21, 2025","quick note: i did a TED talk with kano about fire spinning once, but we were asked to do it four days before the event, so we had three days to prepare, and i shrivel from embarrassment every time someone mentions or finds it. so, i’m writing a very high effort blog about fire spinning to redeem myself and wipe that talk from my memory.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fire-1-400x439.jpg]!#@Once upon a time…!#@p!#@I joined MIT Spinning Arts when I was a freshman, and since then I have spun countless props on fire, danced and performed with it, gotten accidental fire haircuts, and lit myself on fire (on accident and on purpose). Besides committing to MIT, joining Spinning Arts was the boldest decision I made in my life, but also one of the best. I’ll spare you the whole “the real fire was the friends I made along the way!” speech, because I’d spend forever and a half gushing about how cool and supportive and hilarious everyone I met there was. By joining this community, I went from tiptoeing around a lighter to loving fire with a passion just short of a pyromaniac’s.!#@p!#@Is it real fire?!#@p!#@Yep. We don’t have a magic coating that makes us fireproof, which means it’s hot and will burn you if you screw up. The fire isn’t any less real than the one you sit around toasting marshmallows in on a camping trip.!#@p!#@Isn’t it dangerous?!#@p!#@Of course it is, but so is football, and archery, dance, and sailing, all for slightly different reasons. Fire spinning is just another sport with it’s own set of precautions people need to take to stay safe. The only reason we can look dangerously hot (pun totally intended) is because we have proper procedures and trainings. Every firespinner has at least one “safety” with a fire blanket. We have a separate fuel dump area from the spinning field and a double bucket system in case things do catch fire. And for every prop we spin and every move we try, we spend hours practicing it off fire before we try it on fire for the first time.!#@p!#@We have this and many more measures in place to keep ourselves alive and uninjured WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TRY THIS WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. While I’d love this blog to be the reason someone new joins the club, I’d rather not be the reason a lovely stranger on the internet ends up turning into a human-shaped flaming hot Cheeto.!#@p!#@How does fire spinning work?!#@p!#@Fire spinners use props that they light on fire and manipulate. It consists of at least one wick, and a handling end. The handling end is for the spinner to control the fire, and can be any length of rope for a dynamic prop, or a rigid structure for static props. The wick itself does not burn and instead soaks up the fuel, which is then lit on fire. the burn time of the prop varies depending on the size and shape of the wick, as well as the speed you’re spinning it at.!#@p!#@Here’s a rough list of common props! This is not an extensive list though, there are way more.!#@p!#@Some people choose to make their own props, and you can get pretty creative considering the grip and wick can be basically any shape and attached any way you want. Aside from the fire frying pan, people have made hook swords, a fire bird puppet, puppy darts (which slide from a puppy hammer into a meteor dart, and even laser cut their own intricate fan designs out of aluminum. As far as number of different props goes, the list includes this and whatever else you crazy engineers come up with.!#@p!#@Practice practice practice!#@p!#@Many club members choose a one or two props they specialize in and hone their skills, getting into really really advanced tricks. As such, we end up with some absolutely cracked staff and poi spinners. I chose the route where I try a lot of different props and get okay at them before getting excited about another challenge and trying something new. I would consider myself practiced at about four props, though I have tried everything i could get my hands on. There’s also the crazy talented people who spin a lot of props and are good at all of them, but it all depends on how much time you spend practicing.!#@p!#@There are other fire arts including fleshing (contact fire), fire eating, and fire breathing, that club exec has formally reintroduced after a lot of planning and effort (including both training and paperwork). I mainly do firebreathing, practice fleshing occasionally, and don’t really eat fire. This would make the post too long, so I’ll maybe talk about these some other time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fire-8-400x276.jpg]!#@Why I like fire!#@p!#@After all that talk of fear danger, I still chose to stay, because it’s really really fun. It’s not something I can fully describe in words, but I will try anyway.!#@p!#@When I’m spinning fire, I forget about everything else. Basically, when I’m spinning, I’m in “the zone”. It’s a level of calm and focus I usually don’t get in the hectic day-to-day of an MIT student.!#@p!#@Fireshows are always some of the best highlights of my year. I get to show off how much I’ve improved, and I get to watch my friends perform insane tricks and choreography. We love the audience and the audience loves us too. When I’m not performing or safetying, I’m cheering my lungs off in the crowd. So if my throat doesn’t hurt the next day, I didn’t cheer loud enough. At the end of the show, I go find my friends to go throttle them and tell them how freaking awesome they are, and we’re all talking and congratulating and giving each other rib-cracking hugs, and I absolutely love these moments.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fire-1-400x439.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fire-8-400x276.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-fear-and-delight-of-fire-spinning/
Pictures From a Year of Classes by Richard O. '28,The End of a Saga,by Richard O. '28,"June 20, 2025","So, about a month ago, I submitted my last exam for the year in Johnson Athletic Center which marked the end of a very, very, very long first year at MIT. So, like the first and second two times, I’m going to finish off the year by giving you all a full run down of everything that happened during this last semester…but with pictures (because I like pictures).!#@p!#@So as you may know by now, MIT has this silly one month period during January called the Independent Activities Period (better known as IAP – learn more about it here, here, and here) where you pretty much get to do whatever you want with your life for the whole month of January.

And the bus had only 2 times it cycled between the mountain and the station in the afternoon: 4PM and 6PM. So we had planned on leaving at 4PM to play it safe. So before we left I wanted to get a vid of me snowboarding down so I did like my last run at 3:30PM. Got to the bottom of the mountain and realized I never pressed record… So here I am thinking: “dang – I didn’t get a single vid of my first time snowboarding”. Turns out, by the time we got to the bus station we missed the bus by like 30secs cause it really left at like 3:55PM. Pretty much a blessing and a curse cause now I had two hours to get a new video before we absolutely had to make the last bus. (We actually also missed the second bus and had to get driven by one of the mountain staff to the train station with like 10 seconds to spare before the last train left for the night…but that’s a story for another time).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7551-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7687-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7939-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9307-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8570-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7028-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6952-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7487-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7389-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-16-075948-800x1073.png]!#@Learn more about DesignPlus in Ellie’s joint blog post with Gloria and Teresa here!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9337-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9258-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9703-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9702-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9751-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8298-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9405-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9410-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9402-800x1422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9576-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8936-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9431-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9425-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9375-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9059-800x600.jpg]!#@Spring break took too long to come by.

for change in (expected + unexpected): by Allison E. '27,print(change.get_thoughts()),by Allison E. '27,"June 19, 2025","Before coming to MIT, I consumed a lot of Content™ about college. Probably too much content. Some of that was my own doing, whether it was YouTube advice videos or romanticized audiobooks or way too many of the MIT Admissions blogs (oops). But some of it was also partially unwilling, mainly via the endless stream of short-form videos spoonfed to me by various algorithms. Whether or not I consumed this content intentionally, though, it all added up to a lot of expectations—both conscious and subconscious—about what college would be like. Picnics on a sunny quad, aesthetic library study sessions, late night conversations… the list goes on.!#@p!#@But now I’ve been here for two years. At real college, not imaginary internet college! There’s been a lot of the ways my life has changed, both expected and unexpected, so I figured I should compile a (non-comprehensive) halfway-done list!!#@p!#@Expected — Weather!#@p!#@This is the one that everyone from [insert place without seasons] probably brings up way too much. I’m exceptionally guilty of this, because even though it’s completely expected, it’s still exciting and confusing and most definitely different. Most people who know I’m going to school in Boston remark on how cold it is, but the most jarring part isn’t actually the lower temperatures—it’s how abruptly the weather can change. At home, the closest I came to checking the weather was reading a school email once every month or two: “With the consideration of our current rainy conditions, I am letting you know that slippers are allowed for tomorrow”. Now, I have to check the weather every morning to decide how many layers to wear, whether to bring an umbrella, etc.!#@p!#@For reference, here’s some snapshots⁠01 of October weather in Cambridge vs. Honolulu:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2884-800x856.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2885-1-800x874.jpg]!#@As you can see, I was incredibly weather-spoiled at home. So far, though, the radically different weather has been really fun! I like cold weather much better than hot, and it’s fun to put together outfits with layers or snuggle under heavy blankets at night. Also, I LOVE SNOW.!#@p!#@Expected — Sleep Schedule!#@p!#@In high school I went to sleep around 10:30 pm, and woke up at 5:30 am.⁠02 When some of my friends started college on the east coast, sometimes I’d text them in the evening, eventually signing off with an “I should go to sleep…” And then they’d say “I should probably do that too.”!#@p!#@Hawaii Standard Time is six hours earlier EST…!#@p!#@Based on that alone, it was pretty evident that college was going to change my very respectable high school sleep schedule. And, as my roommates can attest, it most certainly has—my bedtime is now around 3:00 am, and I wake up around 10:00 am⁠03 . In general, I’m getting about the same amount of sleep as in high school, but the problem is that I’m more naturally an early bird. That’s generally a very lucky thing to be at any time except for college. I feel more tired than the number of hours say I should, and when the days get short I’m sometimes only awake for three or four hours of sunlight…!#@p!#@In my defence, I do have classes or club meetings til 8:30 pm several days a week, and since most of my friends do as well, we’re mainly able to hang out late at night. Thankfully, most days my classes also start around 11:00 am, so I’m able to sleep in much later. But yeah, these are largely excuses. I could go to sleep at normal hours, but I think I’ll just wait til I graduate 😆!#@p!#@Expected — Schoolwork Difficulty!#@p!#@Everyone says that MIT is hard. Everyone⁠04 hears that MIT is hard, and everyone tries to prepare themselves for the fact that MIT is hard, and then everyone is sad when MIT is, in fact, hard. By everyone, I mean me. Freshman fall was great, because PNR⁠05 made the transition much less stressful, and last semester I tried my best (and I think succeeded at) renormalizing my expectations of grades away from the obsessive straight A’s. But that doesn’t mean MIT still isn’t hard 😭. I think the biggest challenge so far for me has been that PSet problems require much more creativity than I’m used to. A lot of them feel more akin (in spirit) to problems I’ve seen in math competitions like the AMC–except that for those tests, a score of 70% (on a multiple choice) might put you in the top 5% of competitors, so the pressure of solving any given problem isn’t as intense. PSets are often collaborative efforts, which definitely helps, but it’s still been something to adjust to. (It’s been two years). (I am not adjusted). (Send help).!#@p!#@Expected — Food!#@p!#@As hard as the folks over at Soylent are working to eliminate humanity’s constant need for food (I firmly disbelieve that Soylent belongs to this category), my body needs food. Several times a day. In reasonably large quantity. How to food?!#@p!#@As I’d heard before arriving, MIT’s dining halls⁠06 are decent, but tiring if repeated. I knew I’d want to start cooking relatively often, and cook I have! It’s been really fun playing with new recipes, cooking with friends, or trying to replicate foods from home (Hawaii has the BEST food and I will fight you on that). I’ve also re-confirmed my conviction that the best way to make friends is freshly baked cookies :)!#@p!#@Unexpected — Roommates!#@p!#@Dorm rooms! Roommates! Shared bathrooms! Oh my! This is probably the most archetypal aspect of the American college experience, and consequently the one for which I’ve been force-fed the most misleading content. After a thousand different TV shows and YouTube videos, I was under the impression that my college roommate, especially my freshman year roommate, would either become my best friend or my worst enemy. That they’d shape my college experience, the other friends I’d make, and the kind of person that I’d grow into. It felt like a lot of pressure for someone randomly chosen out of a hat⁠07 , and I was worried that if I didn’t become best friends with my roommate, I’d be missing out on a core part of the college experience.!#@p!#@These are all lies. LIES, I TELL YOU!!#@p!#@Ok, maybe not lies. There are definitely people who become incredibly close with their roommates, and people who have absolutely terrible experiences. It’s 100% worth the effort to try to get to know your roommate(s). But my freshman year roommates are not my best friends in the whole world. They’re amazing people, and were absolutely awesome to live with. But we weren’t attached at the hip like people are in the movies. And more importantly, I didn’t miss out on a core part of the college experience because of it. I made the most incredible friends outside of my dorm, and we had all those special moments without being roommates–4 am conversations in study rooms, giggling on couches in lounges, and cooking up monstrosities in dorm kitchens. And in a stroke of great luck, this past year I even got to move in with my bestest of friends, Miranda :D!#@p!#@Unexpected — Sleep Ability??!#@p!#@I’ve always had trouble falling asleep—nothing debilitating, but it always takes me a while. Because of this I was a little worried about falling asleep with roommates, especially since I was sleeping on the earlier side⁠08 for the first few months. Turns out, however, that I’m constantly just TOO TIRED for it to matter. I can now fall asleep in ten minutes with the lights on, people talking, and the window wide open, and I’ve even slept through an air mattress being blown up! I know that this doesn’t work out so nicely for everyone, so I’m really grateful that sleep is coming so easily to me now, but I guess occasionally our bodies are more adaptable than we think?!#@p!#@Unexpected — Confidence!#@p!#@I have never felt as confident and comfortable in my own skin as I do now. I think this is partly a function of being more social, and partly a function of being a nerd at a nerd school surrounded by nerds who think being a nerd is cool, but whatever the cause is, it’s great. I can make phone calls without needing a 20 minute cool-down period afterwards. I can strike up conversations with new people without running out of things to say three sentences in. I don’t think about laughing too loud with my friends, and if I feel like skip-run-dancing down dorm row, I’ll do it (…if it’s 4 am and the street is mostly empty). It’s an improvement from a very low baseline, but it’s still a step up that I didn’t expect.!#@p!#@Unexpected — Social Needs & Energy!#@p!#@I’ve always considered myself an introvert, sticking to the corners of rooms or outskirts of social circles, and generally feeling self-conscious. Over the last two years of high school, I definitely became more social, and a lot more comfortable with putting myself out there, but it always felt like I was just getting better at cosplaying extroversion, or just learning more social skills.!#@p!#@After my first couple months at MIT, though, I started to wonder if I wasn’t an introvert after all, but rather a very shy extrovert⁠09 that was finding their people and slowly coming out of their shell. Freshman fall was an avalanche of social situations, and somehow I was coming out of them with more energy than I went in with. It was just… so much fun. When I did start feeling tired, I tried my usual self-care method–staying in and relaxing–but it didn’t seem to do much. Instead, every outing with friends left me feeling refreshed and re-energized. More importantly, when I didn’t have time for those hang outs, I could feel the loneliness getting to me. A lot.!#@p!#@The tail end of freshman spring was rough. I was busy, my friends were busy, and the chasms of time between being together were widening, widening, widening. I could feel my mental health falling into those gaps, and it was scary to realize that I was relying on other people for my happiness. How does one deal with that? Well, I guess by coming up with a weird personal pseudoscience to explain it:!#@p!#@The reason I think this change wasn’t an intrinsic, introvert -> extrovert change, but rather environmental factors bringing out dormant extroversion is that I’m now looking back at high school with slightly different eyes. I did get energy from some social situations, I just didn’t have the chance to hang out with those people often enough to notice. I’ve also realized that just ‘being around’ my friends–studying in the same room, sometimes silent, sometimes with some background chatter–is just as beneficial for me as going out on an excursion. I think the reason I never noticed my ambient social time needs is that in high school, I always had it. My friends had a specific table in the courtyard where we sat every day. Before school, between classes, during lunch, and oftentimes after school til 6:30 pm, many of us would be there working, or chatting, or relaxing. Last summer, as well, I was working in an office with two other interns, and there was the same ambient social energy to existing and working in the same space as other people.!#@p!#@In the year since I figured this out, keeping an eye on my social needs has helped a lot with mental health, and having my best friend as my roommate this year also doesn’t hurt :D. All this to say, I maybe should’ve been more flexible about my identity as a supposed “introvert” and paid attention sooner to what my body/mind were actually telling me about my needs.!#@p!#@Unexpected — Drive and Ambition!#@p!#@Sometimes, I feel like I used up my whole gas tank in high school, and for the last two years I’ve been coasting on fumes and inertia. I don’t think this is unusual, but it’s not something that I fully expected, and not to this degree⁠10 . I think some of it comes from MIT being such an intense place. I end up using most of my drive just to get through classes, and when everyone around you is doing absolutely insane things–things you know you literally aren’t capable of–it sometimes feels like it’s not worth striving at all.!#@p!#@That sounds terrible. And from many perspectives, it is terrible. But I’m not entirely unhappy with my “lack of drive.” Sometimes I think of it as an issue of diminishing marginal returns. If I put in the effort to do well in my classes, find decent-but-not-prestigious work opportunities, and generally develop useful skills, that’s plenty enough to set up a future. For every extra hour of grinding, the additional reward diminishes exponentially, and the total amount of time I’d have to spend turning myself into the model MIT intellectual is simply enormous. I’d get so much more utility out of that time if I spent it supporting my friends, or making music, or helping run a high school science tournament. More importantly, in the words of Hank Green, “your own joy can be something you produce.”⁠11 Sometimes, I just want to produce joy for myself and my friends, and I’m ok with that. Because it brings another change:!#@p!#@Unexpected — Happiness!#@p!#@https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cant-stop-smiling/!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2884-800x856.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2885-1-800x874.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/for-change-in-expected-unexpected/

"From East to West: An American’s Cross-Atlantic Voyage by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",The start of my MISTI UK experience,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","June 10, 2025","I’m currently in the exotic land of England. Over a week ago, I flew into Heathrow Airport on a dragon, and then I rode with a group of knights from London to Bristol, where I currently reside in a castle.!#@p!#@I’m here through MISTI, or MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives. Through MISTI, students can either participate in internship programs with companies and labs all over the world, or teaching programs where students teach STEM and entrepreneurship at high schools in different countries.!#@p!#@Right now, I’m staying in Bristol with Anika (READ HER POST HERE), who’s another blogger! We’re both working in the Dexterous Robotics group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, although we’re in different projects. It’s a relief that I’m staying with someone I know, since this is the first time I’ve ever been in the UK.!#@p!#@My journey involved three phases:!#@p!#@The few days leading up to my flight to London were hectic. I was graduating, so along with the two ceremonies I went to, I was moving all over MIT and Boston with family. I finally got that damn diploma that I shed so many tears over. Then, I had to pack up everything that was left in my room, and I moved out of Next House. As someone who lived there for all four years of undergrad, it felt weird. But I’ll leave post-graduation feelings for another post.!#@p!#@I arrived at Logan International with Anika through a shared Uber, and then we went off to our separate gates — she was taking Delta, and I was taking British Airways. I pretty much bummed around at the gate for two hours, where I finished the rest of Season 2 of The Rehearsal.⁠01 Admittedly, I was getting nervous. This was my first solo international flight, after all.!#@p!#@Half an hour before boarding, an old man rushed over and sank down in the seat next to me. He closed his eyes and heaved a sigh. Turning to me, he grumbled, “Of all the airports I’ve been in, Logan International is on my shit list.”!#@p!#@He sounded a lot like David Sedaris, with a similar amount of his wit. He asked me if I’ve been to the UK before, and I told him that it was my first time. When I asked him how much he’s visited, he said, “Oh, many times. I was a medieval history major back in my post-doc years, so I’ve given tours for cathedrals and such. England is a lovely place.”!#@p!#@It was an uneventful flight, and therefore a good flight. I watched Madagascar and the first half of Pee-wee as Himself, and then I dozed off. Throughout the short moments where I was awake, the sky sped from sunset to sunrise in only a handful of hours, like the world outside was on fast-forward.!#@p!#@My brief stay at Heathrow Airport was also uneventful. I was tired and gassy (shh don’t tell anyone else) as I waited for my baggage. I glanced down at my phone.!#@p!#@No mobile data. Uh oh. I turned the airport Wi-Fi on and off. Still no data.!#@p!#@Kids, when you get an eSIM before an international flight, make sure that it’s properly activated. I had to do this once I got to the flat, where there was stable Wi-Fi.!#@p!#@Although I was data-less, I luckily had the foresight to download my train tickets beforehand.!#@p!#@I had to take two trains: through the Heathrow Express⁠02  from Heathrow Airport to Paddington Station, and then with the Great Western Railway from Paddington (London) to Bristol.!#@p!#@When I reached Paddington, I was greeted by a massive glass ceiling that arched over several terminals. I had half and hour to spare before my train arrived, so I tracked down the Paddington Bear statue for a quick picture. As I waited in an empty seat near the departure boards, I could feel sleepiness finally start to creep in.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-8.01.07-PM-400x482.png]!#@The train ride was about an hour and forty minutes, and I was asleep for the first half of it. But when I woke up, the English countryside was passing by my window. It was a landscape that I had only seen in TV shows and movies. It was beautiful. Horses and sheep occasionally dotted the fields. When the train went through Bath Spa Station, the track was surrounded by canals and elegant structures tucked between trees and hills.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-6.51.40-PM-800x376.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-6.51.58-PM-800x926.png]!#@Yeah, I don’t have anything else to say about this part of the trip. It was my favorite part, though.!#@p!#@By the time I arrived at the station, I was famished. The melon sticks I ate at Heathrow weren’t enough to fend off the hunger pangs. As I hauled my luggage through the place, a warm savory smell drifted from one of the stores. I was so hungry that it might as well have sent me floating through the air like a cartoon character.!#@p!#@Sure enough, it led me to a nearby pasty shop. Pasties are kind of like folded pies, which are usually filled with savory fillings like meat and vegetables. One of the women gathered behind the counter saw me and said, “Sorry, love, our card reader is broken so we only take cash.” But luckily, I exchanged some dollars for pounds back at Heathrow, so I bought a chicken/bacon/leek pasty. To this day, I haven’t found a pasty that was as good as that one.⁠03 Maybe it was the hunger that warped my senses, but it was the best thing I had eaten in weeks.!#@p!#@I took an Uber from Bristol to the flat. Back in the States, I told my landlord that I would arrive at the flat at around 2 PM. When I got there, it was 1:30 PM. With no mobile data to contact her over Whatsapp, I awkwardly lingered around the front door with my luggage. I wished that I had bought another pasty.!#@p!#@A car pulled into the parking lot next to the flat. A white-haired elderly man stepped out with a bag of groceries. Curious, he stood and peered at me for a few moments. I nodded and smiled, and he waved back with a soft smile. He headed into the flat that was two doors down from me, dropped off the bag, and then headed back into his car before driving off.!#@p!#@I squatted there and tried to bust out a blog post on Microsoft Word before the old man came back, half an hour later. It was 2 PM, with my landlord nowhere in sight. He stared at me for a few seconds longer than before. Walking over to me, he asked in a quiet voice, “Are you moving in?”!#@p!#@Smiling sheepishly, I said, “Yes, I’ll be staying here for the summer. I’m waiting for my landlord.”!#@p!#@“Oh dear. You’ve been waiting for quite a while.”!#@p!#@And then, he says The Phrase.!#@p!#@“…would you like a cup of tea?”!#@p!#@If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve said, “Oh, I’m fine. But thank you!” Because why would I go into some guy’s apartment if I didn’t even know them?!#@p!#@But, this was not the United States. This past semester, all of the students in the MISTI UK program had to attend a handful of training sessions, where our program coordinator Stephen taught us that “Would you like a cup of tea?” is not just a question about drink preference, but a gesture of friendship and even comfort. To reject the Cuppa Tea is to reject such a gesture, to signal that I was not interested in establishing some semblance of social connection.!#@p!#@Heeding Stephen’s advice, I accepted. With a warm smile, the neighbor let me into his apartment.!#@p!#@Now, you should be wary of stranger danger. I don’t want to set a bad example and say that I had a “feeling”⁠04 that this would be a harmless encounter, especially since I didn’t have phone service. But, since I’m writing this alive and well, I have the privilege to recount what happened.!#@p!#@The man fixed me up a Cuppa Tea, which actually ended up being a glass of orange juice. We sat down on his couch with a polite distance between us, awkwardly sitting there in silence. I thanked him for the Cuppa Tea. I asked him if I could call my landlord, and he says, “Oh, I don’t have one of those handheld phones, but I have a landline over there if you would like.” He motions to an off-white plastic landline, next to a wooden old-fashioned radio and a pile of album covers for a band called The Drifters.!#@p!#@I usually get stiff around older people out of the fear that I’ll set a bad example for Generation Z, but I was even stiffer around this man. I was still trying to figure out English social cues, and I didn’t want to repulse this kind old man with American brashness. So, I tried out some light conversation.!#@p!#@“This is my first time in England,” I admitted.!#@p!#@His eyes grew wide. “You’ve never been in England?” he said, in quiet awe. “I’ve lived in England all my life,” he said, his eyes still wide.!#@p!#@Eventually, I said that I should check if my landlord is here. The man said, “Oh, I can take you to Matt, who lives nearby. He’ll probably have her number, since she used to live here.”!#@p!#@He led me to the other side of the row of flats, where he introduced me to a couple in their 30’s. They were quite friendly as well. “This is her first time in England!” the old man added as Matt let me borrow his phone. Right at that moment, my landlord pulled her car over by the street and hurried over to me. “I’m so sorry, my love!” she called. She wrapped me in a warm hug. “I was getting one of your keys copied, and it was taking longer than I thought!”!#@p!#@She gestured towards the old man. “And I see you’ve met Martin! He used to be my neighbor when I was here.”!#@p!#@“This is her first time in England!” Martin said, with the same amount of awe as before.!#@p!#@“Yeah!” my landlord said. “She’s from America! Isn’t that exciting?”!#@p!#@“Oh!” he said, his eyes growing wide with fascination. “I’ve never been to America. Would not like to, either.”!#@p!#@Not only does Bristol have rich artistic history,⁠05 but I’ve heard that Bristolians are known for being friendly and open. Even then, I didn’t expect the warm welcome I would receive from my neighbors on my very first day. I spent my last three summers on MIT’s campus as a student researcher, and as much as I enjoyed staying in Boston, I’m really glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to spend this summer in Bristol.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-10.00.58-PM-800x423.png]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-8.01.07-PM-400x482.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-6.51.40-PM-800x376.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-6.51.58-PM-800x926.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-10-at-10.00.58-PM-800x423.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/from-east-to-west-an-americans-cross-atlantic-voyage/

If you can’t tell who’s who in the following series of pictures, you haven’t read enough blogs.!#@p!#@Everything is jarringly British in Bristol (wow what a shock). I know I’m in the UK, but it’s still surprising when I go to play a song and get an ad for body wash where everyone is talking with a British accent. The names are fascinating too. Under any other circumstance, I would have a hard time believing that Nempnett Thrubwell and Coombe Dingle are names of real places.!#@p!#@I’ve been here for two days and I’m really happy about my living situation, mostly because I’m in the same apartment with Jebby ’25 who’s chill and cool and awesome and super chill.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-6.jpg]!#@I’m scared to act as weirdly as I normally do in fear of contributing to the “loud unrestrained American” stereotype, so I did a bit of cultural research, including searching up a list of cuss words and their relative offensiveness so I can know what to avoid. I swear casually around my friends at home and I heard some cursing in the lab, so it might be somewhat okay, but you can never be too careful.!#@p!#@In public, Jebby and I both try to act normal, but at home we can use dudebro language and act as unhinged as we want. Based on observations, we can agree that we share half a braincell when we’re within the vicinity of each other.!#@p!#@Cooked or are we cookin’?!#@p!#@Considering the general reputation of British food, we decided it was best to cook most of our time here. Despite the expense of housing eating up most of our stipends, groceries were surprisingly cheap. After too many days of not eating real food, I was craving meat, so our first meal was a huge plate of salmon and eggs.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-1.jpg]!#@We ran into some issues in the kitchen though. There was no kitchen knife. I was stuck sawing through fish and raw potatoes with a butter knife until my collarbone hurt. Jebby got stuck in the corner spending an entire hour peeling 4 potatoes with the “peeler” that came with the kitchen supplies. You could probably peel faster with a seashell. We made it work though.!#@p!#@I think I tasted heaven in that first meal. I have drastically improved my cooking abilities since freshman year back when I was making rice cooker cocoa. Now, I’m proud to say I cooked so hard I knocked someone out cold for several hours (Jebby got a food coma because she ate so much because it was so good).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-3.jpg]!#@The Heeby Jebby’s!#@p!#@One thing I notice without fail whenever I travel somewhere are the local insects. I’ve caught at least 5 different species of spiders in California, more roaches than I can count on my hands in Boston, and have been absolutely fascinated by the fireflies and rhinoceros beetles in Italy.!#@p!#@Here, there seem to be a lot of stinkbugs and tiny little leafhoppers. We occasionally see an ant crawling around the kitchen, but I am glad that it is normal-sized and not the 1cm-long horse ants found further in the UK.!#@p!#@I love bugs. Jebby does not. She did not enjoy Noodle’s presence at all. I’m convinced she would be fine with the roach if it was more realistic, since the high saturation of the print made the bottom look really fleshy. Fortunately for her, I sleep with it at night so it stays in my room most of the time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-2.png]!#@Blogaholics anonymous!#@p!#@Hanging around another blogger regularly gave me a lot more motivation to blog, hence why you’re seeing two blogs in a week.

You’ll hear about my time at Bristol Robotics Lab some other time. >:D!#@p!#@Unless we are #artsy#inspired, Jebby and I both take frequent breaks blogging because creativity takes a lot of energy.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-4.jpg]!#@Oh, and we have a nice bathroom!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-5.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-6.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-2.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-4.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crossover-5.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-worlds-greatest-crossover-episode-joint-post/
MIT Bloggers Sniped Wrapped by Kayode D. '27,in which people take a LOT of photos of me around campus,by Kayode D. '27,"June 2, 2025","At MIT, a lot of groups use Slack to stay connected. It’s like a big series of group chats for work stuff or class materials. What’s really cool is that you can make separate tabs for different topics. It’s kind of like discord for your dad.!#@p!#@Most groups have a general announcements tab, some for different subgroups, one for random or fun things that happen, and [often among student groups] a stalking channel.

[Joint Post] Interviewing Two MIT Physics Heroes by Richard O. '28,An Interview with Two MIT Physics Professors that are Departing from MIT.,by Richard O. '28,"May 30, 2025","This year, MIT learned that two beloved members of our community would be leaving the institute at the end of the year. Professor Peter Dourmashkin and Lecturer Mohamed Abdelhafez are two physics teachers that have supported the education of physics at MIT in a myriad of ways. From developing the TEAL structure of the 8.01 (Classical Mechanics) and 8.02 (Electricity and Magnetism) subjects that most all MIT students take to giving up hours of their time to making sure students feel comfortable with the course material, both professors have contributed so much to the physics community here on campus and beyond.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9473-3.jpg]!#@So, with that, fellow blogger Kano and I decided to conduct an interview to document their stories and transcribe them in a blog so that we could highlight the kinds of people that make MIT, MIT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9503-scaled.png]!#@We hope this blog captures the impact that these two professors have had on our institute in their time here and provides a little glimpse into these two lives that the MIT community would not be the same without.!#@p!#@Peter Dourmashkin is a senior Lecturer who came to MIT in 1972. After attaining his PhD, Peter began working at MIT in 1984 in a number of different MIT educational initiatives ranging from the Terrascope program and Integrated studies program to Project Interphase and teaching in the Physics Department. “Eventually, the physics department said, ‘just concentrate on physics — just do that.’ So, I’ve been here a long time,” Peter said. Peter’s last day at the institute is July 31st, 2025.!#@p!#@Mohamed Abdelhafez is a lecturer in the physics department who has been with MIT for six years. Mohamed originally hails from Egypt where he completed his undergraduate degree and attended the University of Chicago to attain a PhD in physics. During his time at the University of Chicago, Mohamed realized he was more interested in education than research and came to MIT to pursue that passion. “I wanted to shift more into teaching and I was lucky that I got a postdoc here at MIT in physics education research,” he said. Mohamed has been teaching at MIT since 2019 and his last day will be July 1st, 2025.!#@p!#@When asked about what they love the most about the Institute, Mohamed replied saying there were two things: The first thing was students. “I love MIT students. I feel like there is a very special connection between me and MIT students,” he said. “Students here are very motivated and very interactive and appreciative. They shaped me into who I am, really.” The second thing that Mohamed stated was the excitement that exists on MIT’s campus. “There is always something new and exciting happening. Nothing is static here. You have to be on your toes all the time and listen to new ideas.”!#@p!#@In Peter’s response, Peter discussed the value he finds in being able to make an impact in the lives of the students he teaches. “When I go elsewhere, people ask me: ‘what do I do?’ […] I just basically say it’s an incredible privilege to teach at MIT because we do have some of the best students in the United States,” Peter said. Peter then went on to describe a story of an encounter he had with a previous student of his who had told him and his wife that Peter had helped him pass his 8.01 course which allowed him to become a computer science major. “And that’s just really satisfying. It has just really been a privilege. I consider myself incredibly lucky that I managed to stay here for this long,” he added.!#@p!#@Peter explained how he had initially been shocked with the environment upon arrival, not having originally been from a city, but then started to find people who made his experience more interesting. “So it was a transition period. Over time, you meet so many interesting people, it’s amazing,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed then followed by explaining how, when he first came, he had fears of not being able to adequately support the students. “I was very scared that I didn’t have the necessary background to teach those kids,” Mohamed said. He then went on to explain how, very quickly, he realized that just like any other student, MIT students can struggle in physics classes too. “MIT students are very special and each of them in their own different way, but not all of them were finding physics, for example, very easy. On the contrary, I would say the majority actually have some struggles with physics and math – just like anywhere else,” Mohamed said.!#@p!#@Mohamed started by explaining his experience leading to his first few exam review sessions while working as a graduate TA (Teaching Assistant)  under Peter. Peter added, “I remember Mohamed and I did it together. I remember just saying, okay, Mohamed, now you do this.” Mohamed then explained how he felt pretty nervous before the first review but then reassured himself that he had done the best he could to help the students when the review was over. For the second review session, however, Mohamed described his shock when he was welcomed by a hallway packed with almost 200 students. “I didn’t really believe that this was happening. I think that right there, I told them: ‘I think this will be my peak.’ […] But wow, there were maybe 200 students all thinking that this is helping them. So yeah, I always remember that night.”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2333D4B-9634-4F1D-9536-291900A38CD0-800x605.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F5B0073F-A801-4A5A-97C1-9E5B9A47F32C-800x600.jpg]!#@Peter then answered by describing moments where students would work out problems on their own in the classroom and he could walk around and have conversations with them. “That type of connection is the feeling that it’s not a lecture, it’s a learning community, and that’s really special.” Peter then discusses how he really enjoys the moments where he sees a student is struggling and is able to say something that changes the way they approach the problem that leads to those ‘aha’ moments. “All those things, they just add up,” he said.!#@p!#@Peter answered with, “rotation translation of rigid bodies from 8.01” and described a class demo that’s usually done using a bicycle wheel that’s spun and then allowed to skid and roll along the floor. “We do a special case of it, with a fixed axis, but it generalizes to some really elegant and beautiful mathematics at the same time,” Peter said. He then added that Faraday’s law was his favorite from 8.02 because it has the most demonstrations and is the most historically misunderstood.!#@p!#@Mohamed followed by explaining his appreciation for the abstraction that comes with 8.02, especially with Gauss’s law, having been a theoretical physicist and having a deep interest in mathematics. “Gauss’s law is a big mathematical abstract idea. You have to construct imaginary surfaces and stuff. So I love the first layer of abstraction that comes with Gauss’s law,” he said. Mohamed then added that Faraday’s law and the assembling of Maxwell’s equations were also his favorite because they provided an, “elegant way of describing the whole course.”!#@p!#@Mohamed explained how the implementation of learning sequences, which are online modules with videos and questions to introduce students to new topics before lecture, has improved since his arrival to campus. “I think that model has been refined year by year by Peter and other members in the group and I think now we have a better model than we had before,” Mohamed said.!#@p!#@Peter then answered by explaining how the entire TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) format of the physics courses had started and been improved gradually during his time at MIT. The format of TEAL, according to Peter, was based on several different teaching models across different universities, and, over time, saw improvements such as the introduction of undergraduate TAs to bridge the gap between students and staff as well as the lightboard that’s used in the learning sequence videos. “So when you ask how the course changed, there were a hundred little changes like that since the very beginning,” Peter stated.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-27-105528.png]!#@Peter replied describing a moment he has with students where they’re working with objects on an inclined plane. During this unit, sometimes Peter would usually approach a group of students and ask them which cylinder they feel will reach the bottom of the incline first. Knowing that the students would often know the correct answer and choose that one, he then holds the two cylinder at the top but then releases the one that they didn’t choose ahead of the other cylinder so that it reaches the bottom first while holding the cylinder they did choose. “So sometimes I’ll intentionally say things that aren’t right, because you have to break out of that mindset. You have to think independently and challenge everything that people say and decide whether it’s true for yourself. So sometimes I like to shake up the class that way, and that’s always fun. I love that,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed started by describing the feeling as magic. He explained how he struggled to understand the immense appreciation that’s been shown to him from students and how whenever a new cohort of students starts taking the physics GIR’s (General Institute Requirements) they immediately develop a sort of trust in him. “There is a huge trust in me, and I trust them. I really value this mutual trust,” Mohamed said.!#@p!#@Peter followed by emphasizing the trust students have in Mohamed, stating how Mohamed’s work is usually done for the students in a selfless way. “He’s there to help the students learn. He’s not there maybe to show how smart he is or how much he knows and that’s immediately obvious and you can see that with personal interactions with people,” Peter said. Peter also added a comment describing his appreciation for Mohamed’s fast response time on the platform Piazza which is a tool that students can use to submit public or private questions to course staff about homework or course material. “When students ask Piazza questions, sometimes I’m sitting there and I see it. I’m getting ready to write an answer, but Mohamed’s already answered!”!#@p!#@Peter then explained how spending so much time at the institute has changed his interaction with the students from when he was only a few years older than them to being much older than them. Looking ahead, however, he expressed excitement for the future of the current physics education group. “At this stage in my career, I consider it a huge accomplishment that the physics department has made a commitment to education,” he stated.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0329-800x433.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5933-800x450.jpg]!#@Peter began by highlighting the importance of keeping a positive mindset. Having been an undergraduate at MIT himself, Peter explained how coming to MIT for the first time can make it really easy to experience imposter syndrome, but then explained how having the right framework of mind can make one’s time here all the more exciting. Peter then emphasized the numerous resources available for students in 8.01 and 8.02. “Everybody is an MIT student, and each person will realize their own potential. And so you don’t have to compare yourselves to other people. You just want to have a really positive attitude. Then when you graduate, you realize, ‘Wait a second, how did it go so fast?,’” Peter said.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9344.png]!#@Mohamed seconded everything Peter had said while urging the importance of getting stuck on a problem and not being hesitant to ask for help. In describing the learning process, Mohamed states that, “it’s okay to be stuck and spend some time on a problem and then ask for some help. Take your time to be stuck and to struggle a little bit, and that helps you. Without that, you’re not going to grow.”!#@p!#@Peter started by explaining how he had to postpone a number of activities since he began teaching physics. “We wrote a book on the physics of bicycling, but now I have to update it to eBikes and motors because we wrote it in the early eighties,” Peter said. Peter also added that he was really interested in the intersection of mathematics and music and he plans to continue playing the piano and pursuing his music passion by taking music theory courses.!#@p!#@Mohamed followed by sharing his deep love for Arabic music. “I want to start a YouTube channel or something for the Arabic audience.” Additionally, Mohamed is a big fan of soccer and stated that he enjoys following the English Premier League but also added that he has a third passion for programming where he often uses programming in the context of his other two passions. “So I’ve written code for music that I’m playing on my own keyboard. And I also have written code for soccer for the Premier League. I’m a very big fan of just putting my brain into something that can help people, especially in the places where I’m passionate about.”!#@p!#@During this discussion of programming, Peter also pointed out that in his time at the Institute, Mohamed has had a significant hand in developing code that has helped to improve the organization needed in the backend of the physics courses. “Mohamed’s written a huge amount of code that has totally simplified my life and saved hours and hours and hours in terms of the backend of the course,” Peter stated.!#@p!#@Peter listed several activities that included walking, talking, and cooking with his wife, playing the piano, taking care of his cat, as well as tending to a garden. “I might put an hour in the garden every day. It’s very meditative to get the soil in your hands and I like that a lot,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed then told us about his two daughters and how he would spend time with them after picking them up from school and then begin working after they fell asleep. With his two daughters getting older, he also noted that he found himself having more free time which has allowed him to spend more time learning how to play Egyptian music. “Any time I have now at home, I’m just trying to recreate any of my favorite songs from memory and then I post it on Instagram,” Mohamed said.!#@p!#@Peter answered by telling us that he had first come to MIT wanting to be a film major because of a film documentary program on campus, but, for a time, he had considered transferring to the California Institute of the Arts. He then told us a story about when he visited the school and met a film specialist (who turned out to be the creator of Star Wars) but then added that he was happy having stuck with physics because he felt he might’ve burnt out working in film.”So my alternative life might’ve been in film, but I’m happy that I didn’t do that,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed then told us he either would’ve been a web developer or a musician and shared a story about his experience in writing songs for the scouting team at his University in Egypt where people would sing the songs he wrote. “I’m actually recovering my songs that I created and now I can play them. It’s magnificent for me,” Mohamed added.!#@p!#@Peter started by stating a number of upcoming experiences that include his daughter having her second child in September, spending more time exploring music, sports, and painting, volunteering for indigenous groups, travelling, spending time with his wife, and living. He then added that he would especially miss working with Mohamed for the past six years where he had the opportunity to learn from him. “There’s this very subtle process about ending your career, because sometimes people look through you and every transition in life always has its surprises and its difficulties and its positive things. So I’m kind of looking forward to embracing that transition,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed then replied by saying he was grateful to have been able to work with Peter during his time here. “Peter has been my godfather really since I came here. And I’ve really enjoyed and will continue to enjoy our relationship, of course,” he said. Mohamed then discussed his excitement for continuing research at his alma mater, the University of Chicago. “I know that department, I know the students, I know the courses, but I was a grad student then. So it’s kind of exciting now to come back and be the actual professor teaching the course,” he added.!#@p!#@Following this, Peter began telling us about his first encounter with Mohamed. At MIT and many other institutions, individuals planning to work as a postdoc must give a lecture discussing the concepts they know. When Mohamed had given his lecture, Peter had been invited to sit in the audience and was astounded by the breadth of information that Mohamed had been able to demonstrate. “I was just there thinking: ‘This guy really knows what he’s talking about.’ And he’s designed his own pedagogy and model for teaching. I had the feeling too that Mohamed’s model came from actually working with students,” Peter said.!#@p!#@Mohamed responded by thanking Peter stating that, “Peter was very generous with me. He immediately invited me to be his grad TA in the classroom. That’s not typical for a postdoc,” said Mohamed. Mohamed then went on to add that he had learned so much about teaching introductory physics content from working with Peter. “He just invited me to work with him in the classroom. And I learned 8.01 from him,” Mohamed said.!#@p!#@“See that’s a great thing: teaching is about learning. And that’s the thing about MIT. I realized that you can always be a learner here, always,” Peter said.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9458-2-800x447.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9465-2-800x450.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9473-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9503-scaled.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2333D4B-9634-4F1D-9536-291900A38CD0-800x605.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F5B0073F-A801-4A5A-97C1-9E5B9A47F32C-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-27-105528.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0329-800x433.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5933-800x450.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9344.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9458-2-800x447.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9465-2-800x450.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joint-post-interviewing-two-mit-physics-heroes/

king of boston -> king of the world? by Angie F. '28,the only good fight there is,by Angie F. '28,"May 29, 2025","Here’s something you should know about me: everyone at MIT calls me the King of Boston. And by “everyone” I of course mean myself and about ten other people I have somehow coerced into deriving amusement from my ridiculous, self-indulgent bit. It all started when I was here over the summer for Interphase⁠01 , truly away from home for the first time and overwhelmed by the feeling of having an entire city stretch out before me after a lifetime of short beachside buildings and suburban sprawl. Everyone else there either knew as much as I did or more, with the exception being my friends from out of town who came to visit a couple of weeks in. As shaky and new as it was, my status as a local cemented me as their weekend trip’s official tour guide. I took us up through the Infinite and down into the tunnels, running across the bridge and sailing around in swan boats, wandering through the Boston Public Library and diving into the MFA. However, my Google Maps abilities only took me so far, and I often found myself repeating streets, hopelessly misinterpreting T routes (at one point, our group of three ended up on two separate Green Line trains⁠02 , neither of which was going towards our intended destination), and spinning around as I desperately tried to align myself with the patient app’s arrow.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1068-1-400x711.jpg]!#@“Angie,” my friends would ask me, “are you sure you know where you’re going?”!#@p!#@“Of course I do,” I’d shrug as I brought my phone closer and closer to my face. “I’m the King of Boston.”!#@p!#@Somehow, even after the trip ended, the nickname stuck with me…!#@p!#@…and, eventually, others.!#@p!#@I even dressed as the King of Boston for Halloween, a completely nonsensical costume I had to explain to quite literally every person who passed me by.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0198-400x533.jpg]!#@To this day, I’m not sure why I’ve become so enamored with this little identity I’ve created for myself. I guess it’s because it’s just that: an identity I’ve created for myself. When I first got into MIT, I barely slept for four straight nights, the pure excitement coursing through my veins keeping my eyes plastered open for hours on end. When I got here for the summer, I found myself spending copious amounts of time staring up at my ceiling in the dark once again, overwhelmed by the feeling that, here, I could finally be wherever, whatever, and whoever I wanted to be. When the semester kicked off, those sleepless nights persisted, but some of the excitement gave way to something else, a restlessness I couldn’t really name. I’d fall asleep and find it still there when I woke up, following me through morning classes and afternoon dining hall visits and, finally, nights spent on Killian Court staring at the dome. Lit up from within in blinding, brilliant white, it towered over me in a way that seemed to say “ok, you can be whatever you want. So, what’s it going to be?”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5327-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0373-800x1067.jpg]!#@I applied to MIT dead set on course 6-4⁠03 , on making my way to the forefront of AI development and steering it to responsible yet world-altering growth. Over the summer, I fell in love with the idea of building something I could see and feel and turned to engineering: course 2⁠04 to be more specific. Once the semester kicked off, though, I found myself writing literature reviews on human-robot interaction in space for my UROP⁠05 , finding beauty in the synchronicity and the mystery of molecular biology through 7.012⁠06 , and yearning for a return to my high school programming days as one of my best friends walked me through his 6.1210⁠07 pset during one of our many late night study sessions.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0588-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0255-800x1082.jpg]!#@In high school, the goals I could choose for myself were fairly limited: it was very easy to choose a few and zero in on them, mapping out a clear course of action I could attack with laser focus. Now, though, the world was opening up before me, and it was more beautiful than it was terrifying, by a lot. But, on some days, that gap between awe and fear closed, and I’d feel like I was already losing a race I’d just started. Once again, I had nights I’d spend wide awake, only this time gripped by the vision of myself five, ten years from now looking back on the time I spent in this place full of opportunities and knowing that I failed to grasp the right one.!#@p!#@The September wind blowing through Beacon Street carries this fear out of me for the first time. “Maybe it’s immature, but all I know is that I want to do something great. I just have no clue how,” I tell a friend as we make our way through the night. For some reason, something within me braces itself for his response, for the dismissal that will surely follow. Nearly everyone I’ve met here so far is driven by a specific set of passions; any mark they want to leave on the world is intertwined with that. Focusing on impact alone feels incomplete, naive.!#@p!#@But what I hear instead is “King of Boston to king of the world.” All I can do is nod.!#@p!#@ii. the murdered dead of armies!#@p!#@As the months pass, this conversation stays with me; so do the sleepless nights, my mounting indecision. And I feel myself moving slower, reaching for opportunities with less vigor, burdened by the terrible feeling of being behind. Whatever it is I’ll eventually realize I want to do, others will have wanted to do it for longer, and it’ll be too late for me to catch up and leave any kind of impact. Initially, I’m not consciously aware of this conclusion I’ve reached, but it’s started dragging at my ankles by first semester finals week and pulling me back with all its might by the end of IAP⁠08 . When I preregister for classes, all I can think about are my friends who took them freshman fall, or tested or petitioned out of them before I even knew they existed. When I quit my UROP, as I finally admit to myself that the work has lost its luster and I likely won’t be an engineer and need to set myself on a path that isn’t robotics, I feel like I’ve let go of a lifeline, like I’ll never have another opportunity like that again.!#@p!#@I fail at one thing, and then another, and then I register for 14.01⁠09 , because I tell myself that I likely won’t find that path that I long for, where I find work I can absolutely lose myself in and put every beautiful thing I’ve been given by the world (my hands my eyes my ears my single in Maseeh my late nights in Barker⁠10 my hallways full of research posters all my brilliant beautiful friends) back into it ten times over, so I might as well ensure I’m successful by at least some metric: that is to say, I might as well make some money. And there are many really important and entertaining problems in econ, anyway, even if it isn’t what I think would satisfy me long term. This, of course, comes with its own set of problems, because even though the path I’d follow as a financebro is clearer to me than the one I’d follow as a course ? focusing on ?, I never once delude myself into thinking it will be easy: some of the smartest people I know have already started working on getting into the field much harder and earlier than I am now, and who am I to think I could measure up to them? The direction gives me some comfort, though, and the kinds of problems I’d be solving at any of the summer internship positions I look at in vain are complex and interesting: for a few weeks, it’s something close to enough, though I know the whole time I’m turning into something I’m not.!#@p!#@Then, I bomb an interview. My interview skills are mostly fine, though I’m talking at a million miles an hour and drinking way too much water; I like the MBA student interviewing me; and the position sounds genuinely fascinating, largely because I’d have a completely technical role that wouldn’t require any financial knowledge I couldn’t reasonably develop myself in the next few months. But I’m, to put it lightly, technically incompetent, and it embarrasses me so much I briefly consider emailing the interviewer to report that I’d hit my head on the way to the interview and not realized I was concussed until after. I twitch every time I think about it for the rest of the day, and the day after that. Overall I’m pretty chill about it. And I keep applying for jobs (though I retreat from finance with my tail between my legs and aim for more pure CS stuff), and I ramp up my work for Arcturus outreach.!#@p!#@Arcturus is our autonomous robotics team, and they build an autonomous boat every year for the Roboboat competition. STEM-related community service was a big part of who I was in high school, and I wanted to make sure I kept at it at MIT, where I was in such a unique position to give back. So, early fall semester, I joined Arcturus as the head of their outreach program. Every time I show up to the Seagrant lab⁠11 , to drag Fish n’ Ships⁠12 through Cambridgeport on a little wagon or to teach kids to make their own robot boats and stop them from trying to tear the lab door hinges off with PVC cutters⁠13 , I catch myself staring at every sign and every piece of machinery, asking the Arcturus team members about what other kind of research goes on in the lab.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0554-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0555-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1231-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1604-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1976-800x600.jpg]!#@Maybe I just miss home, I tell myself: for most of my life, the beach was never more than thirty seconds away. But I hear myself telling so many of my friends about this one researcher’s work learning from seal whiskers to create better sensors, and a few weeks later, I’m at an electrical engineering and computer science summer UROP fair and nothing intrigues me more than the lab creating machine learning (ML) models for ocean dynamics. And, in spite of me sending the same copy-paste interest email to most everyone who attended, that is the lab that gives me the most enthusiastic response, and the one I end up working with. A few days after my work with them starts, I find myself at an Arcturus outreach event telling the team leads that, depending on how I feel about ML stuff following my UROP, I’ll likely join their autonomy team. I’ve never thought about it before then, but as it comes out of my mouth I realize it feels right.!#@p!#@On my second 14.01 midterm– which, thanks to flu b keeping me in bed for both midterm #1 and its makeup, is worth almost half my grade, putting me in a spot where I’d have to do incredibly, incredibly well on both remaining exams in order to get a grade I could achieve with a nontrivial amount of goofing off in my other classes– I answer a question I have absolutely zero clue how to approach with a paragraph on seal whisker sensors and a note informing the grader that I will likely be dropping the class, but had fun learning what I did and thought the lectures were enjoyable. After the exam, I do just that, then close my tab full of practice exams, open up Google Collab, and get to work on my UROP.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rfvr4tfcg-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1927-e1748549520478-800x1025.jpg]!#@“Everyone here is here because they’ve been obsessed with something.” It’s first semester again and Emily and I are sitting on my dorm room floor, closing off one of our semiregular late night debriefs. We’ve already gone through her frat and my UROP and her rocket teams– yes, teams. She’s designing the payload for one and serving as head of explosives for the other. When she said this, I couldn’t help but remember the build team events I attended during orientation week and all the work that comes with just being part of one of them, and my eyes widened. But so did hers, and the fire that never leaves them singed every concern in my mind to dust: if there’s anyone out there who can take on this world (and then everything outside of it– she’s a rocket scientist, after all), it’s Emily.!#@p!#@I nod, vigorously. “I think about this all the time. Like, I look at people and I think ‘you’ve wanted something so much you haven’t been able to sleep before’”!#@p!#@She smiles wide. “I love asking people here what their thing is.” I feel a pang of secondhand fear at the thought of being on the receiving end of that question, but nod in agreement as to not break out of the ping pong rhythm of this excited back and forth I find myself falling into with my friends whenever we remember where we are– a place that is somehow both unfathomably bigger than anything we could dream up and more welcoming than any of the smaller ones we passed through on the way here. And also because I really, really do agree. “Do you want to hear a poem about this that Jack showed me yesterday?” I ask. “Maybe he’s already recited it for you.” Our classmate Jack loves poetry– and physics and philosophy and riding motorcycles and biotechnology and country music and about a million other things. My dad calls him a Renaissance man, but Emily and I get to call him one of our best friends, and this means we hear a lot of poems.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C3313321-1CB4-424B-9918-5F8F285A8025-400x261.jpg]!#@“He hasn’t, read it to me! But keep it under a minute. I have to go to bed.”!#@p!#@I don’t need to read it. I just pause to bring it back to my mind, which only takes a second: after all, it’s been lingering in my head since I first heard it, through dark, wind-slapped walks to and from the library with my hands shoved into my pockets and the groggy mornings after I spend dragging myself out of bed. Once I start, I stutter once or twice– but never stop.!#@p!#@At this point, a smile starts to spread across my face: I’ve read the poem well over a dozen times and never made it through without one.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0253-400x533.jpg]!#@Throughout the poem, Emily’s face has stayed still, her eyes appearing to be trained on the ground but clearly focused on something far, far beyond it. For a second, I worry that she didn’t like it, but then she pulls her phone out and opens her Notes app. “What’s it called? That made me think about my rockets. I want to memorize it too.”!#@p!#@My smile widens. “‘Roll the Dice’ by Charles Bukowski.” We exchange plans for the morning– she’s going to hit the gym and then work on her rockets, I’m going to read for 3.091⁠14 — and with a hug, she leaves me with my desk and my books and my laptop and, of course, my poem. All of a sudden, my morning reading seems very doable tonight. I walk out to grab some late night⁠15 , passing by the floor lounge and seeing Emily, who’d stopped to talk to some friends on the way back to her room. We all wave at each other as I slip past, Emily’s voice ringing behind me. “You don’t understand how excited I am about my rockets, Izaan.”!#@p!#@I feel my smile creep back in, and with it comes a strange sense of certainty I don’t normally feel. All of a sudden, I’m back to a night a few weeks ago that ended in me walking down Amherst Street with Jack, my vision fixing itself to the orange statues peeking out the glowing windows of the Media Lab as I let the autumn night’s wind do its job.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5389-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5126-800x1044.jpg]!#@“Every moment here feels like a dream. Both in the–” I stumble over my words for a bit. “I’m so tired. Both in the way you’d think and also like– you know when you’re just waking up and you’re thinking about the dream you just had, and you’re already kind of forgetting it? I’ll do things and it feels like I’m already awake, remembering them.” Pause. “I need to figure out how to word that better.”!#@p!#@“I understand what you mean.”!#@p!#@“I keep thinking about how this is the most important place I’ll ever be.”!#@p!#@“No, it’s not.” Ping pong ball drops. Or maybe it was never there to begin with. “You’re here for a reason. This place is transitive and transitory: transitory because you’re going to leave, whether you like it or not, and transitive because it’s taking you somewhere.”!#@p!#@Writing this all down over half a year later, I no longer know what I said after that. Even as I said it back then, I don’t think I knew.!#@p!#@I know that, one day, I’ll find something I love as much as Emily loves her rockets. And I know that, for now, I get to spend my days writing code that helps us understand our oceans a little bit better every time I run it, and I’m happy about it. Maybe this is that something, or maybe I’ll go back to mechanical engineering, or biology, or space exploration. Or maybe even finance… though I doubt it. But every day, I meet more brilliant people who were once just like me: undergrads who only knew they wanted to maximize their impact on the world, with no clue how or if they’d do it. And, though I still have my fair share of restless nights, I feel a little more at peace every time our paths cross.!#@p!#@Part of harbor seals’ remarkable ability to use their whiskers to sense their surroundings comes from their ability to keep them still relative to their movements: it’s hypothesized that their undulatory and asymmetric shape helps them reduce the amount that they vibrate in response to forces that affect other natural and manmade sensors. Whether their bodies are twisting lazily along with the current or writhing wildly through the water as they chase after a fish, in the seal’s frame of reference, their whiskers are almost completely still. And maybe that’s all that matters. Keeping certain parts of myself still no matter how much the rest of me moves. If I stop doing STEM outreach, or writing for this blog, or letting my friends in for late night floor talks, even if it means I have more time to lock in and do twelve classes and three UROPs and lock in, I’ll be bastardizing parts of myself I need to guide the rest of me forward. Maybe I just have to focus on keeping them intact, and on staying in motion, and everything else will fall into place.!#@p!#@It’s freshman fall again, and Jack and I are staring out at the skyline. The most important place in the world.!#@p!#@“I don’t know,” I sigh, on the tail end of a ramble about my most recent misadventure, a few moments of hubris-induced hope followed by a considerable blow to my ego. “I guess I just wanted to be king for a day.”!#@p!#@“You’re king for more than a day,” he tells me. And I believe him. And for a moment I’m so aware of this dream, lying awake in my bed as the sunrise warms the brick walls of Maseeh, and each cell in my body feels razor-sharply focused, still sensing the world I just crawled out of and managing to stay perfectly still in order to take it all in. I’ve been here for almost a year, and all I want is still to be able to take it all in.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4621-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0303-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0343-800x1067.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1068-1-400x711.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0198-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5327-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0373-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0588-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0255-800x1082.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0554-800x800.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0555-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1231-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1604-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1976-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rfvr4tfcg-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1927-e1748549520478-800x1025.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C3313321-1CB4-424B-9918-5F8F285A8025-400x261.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0253-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5389-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5126-800x1044.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4621-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0303-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0343-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/king-of-boston-king-of-the-world/
Eating my words at Area Four by Andi Q. '25,Mushroom and fontina pizza my beloved,by Andi Q. '25,"May 29, 2025","Area Four (A4) is a popular pizzeria/cafe near MIT. Known for their wood-fired pizza made from a 10-year-old sourdough starter, A4 is the go-to pizza spot for many MIT students.!#@p!#@But not me.!#@p!#@I am A4’s biggest hater, as I believe their pizza defies all known laws of reality. For one, the crust is always simultaneously burnt yet still undercooked. But more perplexingly, the tip of the slice always flops down and spills toppings, cheese, and sauce all over your lap⁠01 even when you fold it in half.!#@p!#@To appreciate just how cursed this floppiness is, we must first understand some differential geometry. In differential geometry, “Gaussian curvature” is a quantity that describes how a surface curves in 3D space at a given point on the surface. Each direction has some curvature that can be positive (like a frowny face), negative (like a smiley face), or zero (like a straight line); the Gaussian curvature is then defined by multiplying the maximum and minimum curvatures along some directions. The diagram below shows what Gaussian curvature looks like visually:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gaussian_curvature-800x222.png]!#@Gaussian curvature has many nice properties, but in particular:!#@p!#@These two properties mean that if you take a flat surface and bend it in one direction, the other direction will become flat and rigid to preserve the zero Gaussian curvature. Indeed, watch how a strip of paper perks up with just the slightest amount of folding at the end:!#@p!#@Since a pizza slice is a flat surface before you pick it up, we should expect the same thing to happen to it. That’s why it’s mathematically a good idea to fold large slices of pizza to prevent drooping; TED-Ed even made a video about it 12 years ago!!#@p!#@Yet despite this fundamental result of differential geometry, this happens every time:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0922-800x600.png]!#@In a cruel twist of fate, the graduating blogger dinner on Tuesday (featuring Petey and Ceri) was held at A4. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza pictured above, while Jebby, Fatima, and Mel all ordered the “mushroom and fontina” pizza. Mel must have felt sorry for me though (after witnessing the sad drooping of my slice) and offered to trade a slice of the mushroom pizza with me.!#@p!#@The difference between the Hawaiian pizza and the mushroom pizza was night and day. It was not burnt or undercooked. It did not flop when I picked it up. It was… genuinely delicious! Possibly one of the best slices of pizza I’ve eaten while at MIT. Unlike other A4 pizzas I’ve eaten, the mushroom pizza didn’t use any tomato sauce, which probably gave it the structural integrity the other pizzas lacked.!#@p!#@During the dinner, Petey also mentioned (in response to my initial distaste for A4) that former U.S. President Barack Obama chose to dine at A4 when he visited Cambridge in 2015. And of course, Obama also ordered the mushroom and fontina pizza!!#@p!#@I’m still A4’s biggest hater because of all the past pizza sins I’ve suffered there, but I suppose I can no longer say that all of their pizza is bad. Just remind me to order the mushroom and fontina pizza the next time I visit MIT and Petey/Ceri drag me to A4.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gaussian_curvature-800x222.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0922-800x600.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/eating-my-words-at-area-four/
the threek post! by Angie F. '28,my lovely lovely year on maseeh three,by Angie F. '28,"May 27, 2025","I shouldn’t have ranked Maseeh first. That’s the thought that kept creeping around the back of my mind during all of REX⁠01 , as I ran around events at what seemed to be every dorm but the one I was slated to live in for the next year. I’d been warned about this: at Campus Preview Weekend (MIT’s admitted students weekend, also known as CPW) , many upperclassmen told me that, while Maseeh didn’t have the culture other dorms had, its proximity to campus and quick access to a dining hall made up for it. As long as I had individual friends in Maseeh, I’d figured, dorm culture wasn’t too important, and I ranked it first on my housing intent form when it came out in May. However, after getting to campus and dancing, having my face painted, getting covered in whipped cream and feathers, and yelling at a table at Burton Conner, I decided that that was the dorm for me– at least until East Campus, who was responsible for building the giant fort I spent a fair amount of the rest of REX at, reopened. I filled out my FYRE⁠02 form and was unsurprisingly turned away: lots of people had had my same idea, and only one student ended up FYREing into Burton Conner. I shrugged it off pretty quickly and started filling my time with EC events, deciding that Maseeh (floor three, or M3, to be more specific) was as good a place as any to start and end my days at, even if the hours in between were spent, well, anywhere else. I could have spent my whole year like this; one fateful night, however, I walked by the floor three lounge and met…!#@p!#@THE THREEKS!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3087-6-400x300.jpg]!#@Unlike other dorms, who have established cultures that likeminded freshmen found their way to during CPW and Rex, Maseeh attracted an extremely wide variety of people who were then randomly assigned to floors, most of whom I probably would have never met otherwise. As some of my fellow M3 residents put it…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A4DEA1B9-4556-4643-AD0C-5A790232CF17-400x300.jpg]!#@Aside from two floormates I knew before freshman year started, the threeks are largely unlike many of the friends I’ve met through classes, clubs, EC shenanigans, etc. And yet, somehow, when I get back from a day of locking in or balling out or both, it’s not my room but the lounge I feel like I’m coming home to. They’ve turned Maseeh 3 into a place that is both welcoming to everyone and easily distinguishable from any other floor in the building, and given me an incredibly different experience from the cultureless but convenient place to call home I was promised during CPW. What does that experience entail, you may ask? Here’s some of what we like to do…!#@p!#@THRIP! THREEKTREAT!!#@p!#@I unfortunately was unable to attend threek retreat due to a series of scheduling mishaps on my end :( but I’m still putting it first on the list because it is one of my favorites of our new M3 traditions, planned largely by our friend Aleks (a.k.a Garbuz). The Threeks all went to Maine for a weekend and had a grand ol’ time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/43CDE327-DB27-41FC-BFC4-1DCB44AD4E31-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ACF3B676-8F38-4987-9DDD-5B8F7DC508DF-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/94EA748F-B49B-42B6-9A67-99E2033338B3-e1748386737526-800x631.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2990-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FF3A8EA0-0370-4135-AD08-75842B817AA1-800x600.jpg]!#@Wondercoin!#@p!#@It was 4 in the morning in a New Vassar study room when my best friend Carlos told me that he had an idea.!#@p!#@It boiled down to this: we already did embarrassing stuff all the time. What if we could get paid for it? Furthermore, what if we could pay our friends to embarrass themselves for us? And so, Wondercoin was born. With a conversion rate of roughly 50 Wondercoin per Dunkin’ Donuts Meal Deal (inflation hit us hard when the price went from five to six dollars), every friend of ours who chose to be part of our system could propose and accept challenges to and from other friends in exchange for our currency, which they could cash out for real money at any time (though I don’t think anyone ever has). Here are some things this has led to…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3040.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3041.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3042-800x1529.jpg]!#@I had originally planned on going to auditions for Resos, our fellow threek Ali’s a capella group. However, while looking for their audition room, I lingered in front of another group’s table for a bit too long and was asked if I was interested in trying out. I shrugged and nodded: I didn’t know much about a capella, but all the groups were more or less the same at the end of the day, right? A few minutes later, I would read the sign on the table I was in front of and discover that I was horribly wrong. I’d signed up to audition for the Syncopasians, MIT’s East Asian a capella group. They perform original arrangements in not only English but also Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, and other East Asian languages. Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe that they’re the only group on campus that does this, which is pretty awesome! The only problem with this is that I am not East Asian, nor do I know any East Asian languages or consider myself well-versed in any East Asian culture. Uh Oh. Regardless, I remained steadfast and shuffled into the audition room with my head held high. I stuttered my way through some vocal warmups before getting to the main event: my rendition of “Fireflies” by Owl City. However, I could not bring myself to perform such a meaningful song without first explaining why it was so important to me and my journey as a vocalist. Here’s a transcript of my introduction to my performance:!#@p!#@Then, it was time to sing:!#@p!#@After ten excruciating minutes, I was set free and rewarded with a slice of cheesesteak pizza. Eating my prize on the building two benches, I felt incredibly light, like I’d broken through some invisible barrier of self-consciousness and could now unashamedly embarrass myself in any way I pleased. I walked home feeling wholly in charge of my life. Later that weekend, I discovered I’d been rejected from the Syncopasians; a few days later, Carlos revealed the truth behind my audition to a friend in the group, who asked him if the bad singing was part of the bit. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, like most great artists, my craft may never be appreciated in my time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3744-1-400x533.jpg]!#@All of them ended with the three of them promoting our floor’s CPW event…!#@p!#@…The M3 Hot Dog Eating Contest!!#@p!#@We held a hot dog eating contest during CPW to meet incoming freshmen (a.k.a prefrosh) and give them a taste of life on floor. MIT Admissions’ very own Petey ended up winning by a landslide, eating three hot dogs in about three seconds and leaving the crowd in shock.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/76358775463__A3C80638-0D59-4FA7-9D3D-EC78052959CC-400x533.jpg]!#@T-Shirt Exchange!#@p!#@During our first semester, Carlos planned a t-shirt exchange, in which everyone was randomly assigned a threek and had to buy a shirt for them. This was when I was still beginning to get more involved in floor activities, so I didn’t participate in it, but seeing how much fun everyone had with it definitely pushed me to try and become closer friends with everyone on hall! As for the shirts themselves, well… let’s just say that they are top threeekret.!#@p!#@Anooshka’s Flag Changing Ceremony!#@p!#@One day in January, mysterious posters began to appear around M3…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3617-e1748388463964-400x322.jpg]!#@Anooshka had decided that she was going to start every semester by ceremonially changing the flag above her bed, and she had invited us all to join.

Definitely watch the video :p) in the fall, I’m planning on maintaining it for the rest of my time at MIT. In fact, lots of the things that drew me to East Campus during those first few months of freshman year are the things I ended up loving about M3. An abundance of people with silly ideas and the will to commit to them; how welcoming and supportive everyone is; creativity that manifests itself not only in the artistic pursuits of many people on floor but also in the way everyone approaches life, constantly looking for opportunities to sidequest and ways to make every day fun. Despite being incredibly brilliant and talented, everyone on floor is very humble and always tries their best to lift others and their achievements up. I’m so grateful to have had the chance to connect with and learn from the threeks this year, and though I ended up finding community in East Campus, M3 will always have a special place in my heart as my first home at MIT. To any prefrosh reading this: advice from upperclassmen is generally extremely useful, but consider taking a second glance at some of the places they overlook and deciding for yourself what to make of them. You never know what you’ll find :) Threek out!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3087-6-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A4DEA1B9-4556-4643-AD0C-5A790232CF17-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/43CDE327-DB27-41FC-BFC4-1DCB44AD4E31-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ACF3B676-8F38-4987-9DDD-5B8F7DC508DF-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/94EA748F-B49B-42B6-9A67-99E2033338B3-e1748386737526-800x631.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2990-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FF3A8EA0-0370-4135-AD08-75842B817AA1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3040.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3041.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3042-800x1529.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3744-1-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/76358775463__A3C80638-0D59-4FA7-9D3D-EC78052959CC-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3617-e1748388463964-400x322.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4225-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4221-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4234-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4214-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF4247-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3101-1-400x488.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3103-800x683.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCN2009-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7021-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4073-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3104-800x781.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-threek-post/
[Joint Post] DesignPlus by Ellie F. '28,A super cool and awesome first-year learning community ft. Gloria and Teresa (we're not biased),by Ellie F. '28,"May 26, 2025","First year MIT students are given the choice of several types of faculty advising. There’s traditional advising, a non-credit option in which advisees simply meet with their advisor several times a semester; advising seminars (for credit), which combine weekly exploratory classes with normal advising; and learning communities, which are more specialized, community-based advising “teams.” There are currently four options for learning communities: Terrascope, Concourse, Experimental Study Group, and DesignPlus.!#@p!#@We’re here today to talk about DesignPlus, or D+ for short! As the name suggests, it’s oriented around design, and is overseen primarily by the Morningside Academy for Design (MAD). Through mentors/advisors, workshops, speaker talks, and community events, students learn about all types of design and related fields and bond with fellow classmates. There’s also an emphasis on making and designing actual things, and students gain various maker skills and guidance in personal projects. We (Ellie, Teresa, and Gloria) are or were all part of DesignPlus, and it’s had a big impact on our MIT experiences so far, in different ways!!#@p!#@Making things, feeling objects assemble in my hands, seeing beautiful lines flow from my pencil, is so insanely addicting. I never built anything technical in high school, but in my senior year, I dove into an endless whirlwind of crafting, learning crochet and origami, and constantly sketching in all my classes. Still, when it came time to rank my choices for first-year advising, I kept hesitating. What if I wasn’t good enough for DesignPlus?!#@p!#@I ranked DesignPlus first anyway, and, despite lingering fears of not having enough skills or knowledge to fit in, I was completely thrilled to join the community. In the very first meeting, I was already sipping away at the free bobas and helping fold origami modules. I soon got a shop orientation, and Bill, one of the shop managers, trained me on various tools and machines, including both laser cutters, the 3D printers, a CAD software, and the sticker printer.!#@p!#@The DesignPlus schedule mostly consists of two things: community-wide lunches, and seminars. We had free, catered lunch every Thursday, with speakers from different fields and companies sharing their incredible stories while we ate. Afterwards, I’d spend a free hour relaxing in the lounge, working on psets and chatting about people’s various projects. Seminars, on the other hand, differ from person to person. Each seminar had about 10 to 20 people, and they each worked on different projects. I was in the fine metalworking seminar with Rhea, where we’d spend an hour and a half every Tuesday learning to saw, anneal, solder, and polish sheets of metal to turn them into beautiful rings.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-ring-1.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-ring-2-800x765.jpg]!#@Later on in the semester, I started working on more projects in the DesignPlus space. Bill trained me on the CNC embroidery machine, and I used it to embroider a design onto a shirt I had thrifted. Afterwards, I started working on a gift, which was a project we were encouraged to design and create over the course of the semester. I drew out patterns for a big chicken plushie, derived from a few I found online. I’d spend whatever chunks of free time I had in the DesignPlus lounge, cutting out paper mockups and iterating over my designs. When I was done designing, I migrated to the fabric arts room, where I used the free fabric and pins and needles and thread to finish my project.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-chicken-1-800x609.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-chicken-2-800x624.jpg]!#@DesignPlus encapsulates one of my favorite things about MIT: its spirit of creativity and creation. I am surrounded by people who love making and trying new things. Instead of being scared to ask for help, I feel encouraged to do so. I am provided the skills and resources I need to turn my designs into reality. Through DesignPlus, I have become so much more confident in my identity as a designer, builder, and maker.!#@p!#@I was in DesignPlus in my first year! It was the fall of 2022, the second iteration of the program. Admittedly, I didn’t go to a lot of the events that year because I had a class conflict with the weekly seminar time; outside of designated event times, though, I spent a lot of my own time just hanging out or working in the D+ lounge space. I absolutely love that lounge space—besides having one of the most comfy couches on campus (many a nap has been taken there), it’s also just a great community space, filled with other members’ projects, materials, and scraps. It’s a sort of organized chaos, really encouraging experimentation and play, and I love chatting with other people there about their ongoing projects, ideas, and general design-related thoughts. I also appreciate that it’s available as project storage space for D+ members; it’s so convenient not having to lug around bags of materials and partly assembled contraptions.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A3-800x600.jpg]!#@Being part of DesignPlus also gets you tap access to the MAD fabrication shop overall (on the 3rd floor of building N52), which includes a whole range of machines, from metal laser cutters to sewing machines to CNC routers. Bill and Chris, the shop managers, are so helpful and always willing to show you how to use a machine, and they also put in the underappreciated work of making sure everything is functional and safe for shop users. This semester, I started working as a shop monitor, and it’s been fun to guide people around the shop and answer their questions.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B4-800x600.jpg]!#@I can’t overstate just how important this space has been to me in my three years on-campus so far. On one hand, it’s a really great place to work on personal projects, with all the machines/tools available and storage space. On the other hand, and more importantly, it’s kind of like a hub for a lot of architecture and design-affiliated people on-campus. I feel like every time I go to the MAD shop/ Design+ lounge, I run into someone that I know, see a cool project in-progress, or learn a new skill, and I’ve come to treat the shop as a third space or second home on-campus. In my opinion, the most valuable aspect of DesignPlus for me has been how it’s introduced me to the broader architecture/design community at MIT, in no small part due to the lounge and MAD shop access :).!#@p!#@I was also in DesignPlus my first year! To be completely honest, when I was filling out my choices for advisors/seminars, I didn’t really know the distinction between a learning community and traditional advisors. I didn’t take as much time as I probably should have mulling over all of the descriptions for the various seminars, so I kind of ended up choosing DesignPlus on a whim. However, I can say that was one of the best decisions I made as an incoming first year student!!#@p!#@DesignPlus is where I first met Gloria, as well as many of my other maker friends. It’s also how I got to know my first year advisor, Paul, as well as many of the other staple inhabitants of the MAD space, like Bill, Chris, John, etc.!#@p!#@Here are some random photos from my camera roll taken in or around the DesignPlus space—I’ve stayed in touch with the community even after my first year!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A1-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A3-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A4-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A5-800x1067.jpg]!#@And here are some photos that I found beautiful.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B1-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B3-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B4-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B5-800x600.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-ring-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-ring-2-800x765.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-chicken-1-800x609.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/design-plus-chicken-2-800x624.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A3-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B3-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B4-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A1-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A3-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A4-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A5-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B1-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B2-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B3-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B4-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/B5-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joint-post-designplus/
How to build a Tamagotchi by Emiko P. '25,and the power of curiosity,by Emiko P. '25,"May 25, 2025","This semester I built a Tamagotchi: a 2000s toy where the user takes care of a virtual pet! My Tamagotchi, fondly named Tamako, was like the fetus version of a full-fledged Tamagotchi—it was capable of walking, jumping, and looking oh-so-adorable.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tamagotchi.jpeg]!#@As a mechanical engineering major, I had never worked close enough with electronics to the point of designing them, and that had been something I’d really been wanting to remedy. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to design a circuit board.!#@p!#@And that’s where 2.679: Electromechanical Systems II comes in! I took this class for one main reason: the final project was a completely opened ended opportunity to design your own printed circuit board (PCB)! Once I heard that the class would be funding the project and had full access to an amazing course staff, including Steve Banzaert,⁠01 , I was fully on board.!#@p!#@From the very beginning, I wanted to make something cute and fun. My mind kept circling back to retro video games—pixelated cartoons and satisfying, clunky buttons. I eventually landed on the idea of building a Tamagotchi because how fun is that??!!#@p!#@So, without further ado, here are the steps showing how you can build your very own Tamagotchi. (Also check out the end of this blog to see what others in this class created!)!#@p!#@A schematic is a drawing of your electrical components and all of their connections to each other. This is where you decide what features you want your circuit board to have. The components I selected were a TFT LED display (the screen that would show my Tamako pet), three buttons, power switch, 9V battery, and Arduino Nano.!#@p!#@The hardest part of this was figuring out the proper configuration of my LED display to my Arduino Nano. There was very little documentation online about this display (because one of the TAs kindly scrounged around their lab to find a spare one for me), so I had to go through each pin manually and figure out what its function was and how it matched to the Nano.!#@p!#@I made sure to build a quick little prototype that verified this would function how I wanted it to. I had all of these parts already, but usually there would be another step of ordering your parts off of DigiKey, Adafruit, etc.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-22-at-11.35.21_fedc4f15-400x533.jpg]!#@I was then able to translate this prototype to a schematic, which shows all of these components and their connections in a symbolic diagram.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/schematic-400x225.png]!#@This is the part where you bring your schematic to life. How will these connections and these components be positioned on your actual board? I had to keep in mind that I wanted this to be a playable, hand-held game: I was going for a clean look that optimized space.!#@p!#@After organizing the PCB on KiCad, I shipped off the design to be manufactured in China. This is what returned to me a week or so later!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_72cdbef1-400x533.jpg]!#@An important lesson I learned during this step was: ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR WORK PROPERLY!!!#@p!#@This is the step where you physically join parts to the board by connecting their two metal surfaces together. I was pretty new to this skill, but it’s honestly a quick learn, especially because it’s obvious when you’ve made a really solid connection between the two joints.!#@p!#@This is what Tamako was looking like after I installed all the parts.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_1ce8c969-400x533.jpg]!#@This step had one good thing and one bad thing. I’ll start with the bad: I had prototyped this board by displaying text, not images. Unfortunately, this means that I didn’t realize until after I received my PCB that I hadn’t made any way to electrically access the chip that could process/ store the images. TLDR: no images on screen unless I wanted to do some dramatic, complicated rewiring.!#@p!#@However, the good news is: THE PCB WORKED THE SAME AS THE PROTOTYPE!! This is actually huge. The amount of things that could have gone wrong are numerous: I could have messed up the connections between the display and the Arduino, the board could have magically decided it didn’t want to work, I could have done a poor soldering job so there were poor electrical contacts, etc.!#@p!#@But, remarkably, it worked first try. That was huge! And once I realized that I could just form images out of text, I was pretty happy. So in the end, I would say this PCB definitely meets my expectations!!#@p!#@I knew that my minimum viable product (the bare bones criteria I would have to meet in order to consider this project a success) was a device that could have a little pet move around on the screen and jump. So that’s exactly what I did! I made the pet go left, right, and jump. It was perfect :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arduino-code-400x160.png]!#@And with that, the Tamagotchi is complete! It’s pretty simple right now, but there is always room to code something more complicated, to 3D print a plastic shell, and to keep experimenting with the project. But when all is said and done, I’ve loved collecting practical experience with KiCad and Arduino, and I am so proud of myself for successfully designing a PCB for the first time. Learning is fun! Yay!!#@p!#@I hope you enjoy playing with your very own Tamagotchi :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_acfb0f7c-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0014-800x1067.jpg]!#@Curious what other people in my class made this semester?

Many of these people had never really worked with electronics before, but they were willing to learn entirely new skills to bring their visions to life. I felt like I was watching my class dream: they wanted to create something, they were unsure if they possessed the skills to do so, and through some magical mixture of curiosity and drive—they did it. The dream came true.!#@p!#@I mean, what a powerful, crazy, utterly insane idea! To make things because we can! To let our imagination run wild and free, to not reel it back into the realm of the easy and manageable, but to chase it off into the distance and see where it takes us! To accept that we may fail in the pursuit of bringing our dream to life. To push ourselves not because of a class requirement, but because we must try. Because it is in our DNA.!#@p!#@Because this is what drew us to MIT in the first place: unapologetic, relentless curiosity—the secret sauce that makes the impossible possible.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tamagotchi.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-22-at-11.35.21_fedc4f15-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/schematic-400x225.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_72cdbef1-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_1ce8c969-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arduino-code-400x160.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-05-22-at-15.32.23_acfb0f7c-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0014-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0005-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0007-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0011-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0012-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG-20250517-WA0008-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-build-a-tamagotchi/

I’ve been a fan of Hank (and his brother John) for basically my entire conscious life. I stumbled into the Green brothers’ corner of the internet about a decade ago and have been captivated ever since.!#@p!#@Amidst all his projects, Hank leads with heart. He pulls back the curtain and discusses openly: not just about the polished successes, but the failures too, because those are part of the process. He seeks out truth and, when he finds it, he eagerly shares it. He cares deeply about the world and takes action to help make it better. It’s weird to feel so connected to someone I don’t personally know, but my respect for him is very real. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he were an alum — he’s such a perfect embodiment of MIT culture: nerdy, daring, and curious.

How I chose my classes by Andi Q. '25,A graduating senior's perspective; results may vary,by Andi Q. '25,"May 24, 2025","Earlier this week, I finished my last exam as an MIT undergrad. It was a bittersweet moment; I was elated that I’d made it through not just 6.7800 (Inference and Information, the subject of the exam and by far the most challenging class I’ve ever taken) but four years of MIT’s often brutal and unforgiving academic gauntlet, yet also sad that I was leaving this gauntlet behind, no longer taking classes next year. Maybe this is just my MIT-induced masochism/Stockholm syndrome speaking, but I found most of my classes fun (yes, really), rewarding, and memorable (in a good way). It’s one of the reasons why I’ve written so many blog posts about my class projects here.!#@p!#@A major contributor to my enjoyment was Course 6’s⁠01 vast catalog of over 200 classes spanning everything under the sun, from music technology to open-heart surgery. The freedom to choose between so many classes enabled me to learn and apply interesting ideas across all of EECS and kept each semester fresh and exciting.!#@p!#@However, the ocean of choices was also quite overwhelming initially, and it took me a while to figure out exactly what I should look out for when choosing classes, especially electives. This post is about some of the things I think about that helped me navigate this ocean.!#@p!#@I intended this post to be more of a reflection than a guide because there’s no definitive guide to choosing classes. Everyone has a different goal for their MIT career: someone aiming to graduate early may try to maximize the number of classes they take that satisfy multiple graduation requirements; someone aiming to become the best statistician in the world may try to take every statistics class Course 6 and Course 18⁠02 offers; someone aiming to impress their peers may try to take notoriously challenging classes like 6.7800 in their freshman/sophomore years. All these approaches are perfectly valid. Still, I’d be more than happy if this post helps inform how you choose classes at MIT or beyond.!#@p!#@There are three big questions that I ask myself about any class that I’m considering taking. In order, they are:!#@p!#@As much as I would love to be one of those MIT students who can handle 7+ classes per semester⁠04 while still leaving time for eating, sleeping, and socializing, my schedule can only realistically accommodate 4-5 classes. To filter the catalog down to classes I could realistically take, I think about several practical considerations, such as:!#@p!#@… plus a few others that past bloggers like CJ have discussed, e.g. in this post.!#@p!#@Barring one or two exceptions⁠05 , if a class doesn’t fit into my schedule (i.e. if its lectures overlap with anything else), then I will not take it. I think attending lectures (and office hours whenever possible) is crucial for making the most of my MIT education because otherwise, I may as well teach myself the content outside of MIT. Some classes also have exams scheduled during lecture times, so having no conflicting lectures minimizes headaches in that regard too.!#@p!#@Most lab-based classes also require me to be in the lab physically for several hours at a time. If I don’t have a large, contiguous chunk of free time in my schedule, then I try to avoid these kinds of classes too.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/curseroad-400x388.png]!#@My top priority at MIT was to graduate. As such, I aimed to fulfill most of my graduation requirements before my senior year so that I’d be free to take fun elective classes without worrying about outstanding requirements getting in the way. Graduation requirements, particularly introductory requirements, are also good for helping me prepare for those electives.!#@p!#@I like to think of these graduation requirements as parts of a meal: introductory requirements are like vegetables (not particularly exciting but good for me), upper-level requirements are like meat (more exciting and varied), and electives are like dessert (fun, often the most memorable, but not required at all). I ate all my vegetables first because they provided me with vitamins and minerals (technical skills and mathematical maturity), before moving on to the meat with small bites of desserts snuck in between.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eat-your-vegetables-800x556.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eat-your-vegetables-2-800x531.png]!#@Because dessert was so enticing, I also gravitated toward classes satisfying multiple requirements whenever it made sense. For example, 6.3020 (Fundamentals of Music Processing) satisfies two requirements as (1) an advanced undergrad subject⁠06 and (2) a music class⁠07 , while 6.2050 (Digital Systems Laboratory) satisfies four(!) requirements because it’s (1) an advanced undergrad subject⁠08 , (2) has a project-based lab component⁠09 that (3) focuses on technical writing⁠10 and (4) is open-ended and worth >40% of the final grade⁠11 . (It just so happens that this property is most common in lab/project-based classes, which I was most interested in taking anyway.)!#@p!#@It’s always tempting for me⁠12 to answer yes to this question because I think I could handle any single class in the Course 6 catalog. However, that answer would be misleading because it’s only really true in isolation. Things get much more complicated when there are commitments like clubs and other classes also vying for my attention.!#@p!#@I’d typically try to pick a set of classes that add up to around 50 hours per week⁠13 based on my estimate of their workloads. To estimate the hourly workload of a class, I’d look at the average number of hours per week reported by past students⁠14 and then adjust up or down by a few hours based on how many of its prerequisite classes I’d taken. For example, past students in 6.S987 (Physics and Engineering of Superconducting Qubits) spent around 11 hours per week on it, while I spent closer to 13 hours because I didn’t have the quantum physics prerequisites.!#@p!#@Additionally, I’d try to have a balance between classes with final exams and those with final projects. Although projects sound more fun and rewarding than exams (and indeed they often are), I’ve learned the hard way that having four simultaneous final projects is often much less fun than having four final exams.!#@p!#@Not every class is offered every year! Some classic examples in Course 6 are:!#@p!#@After filtering the catalog down to classes I could take, I’d further filter it down to classes I might want to take. This step is usually fairly straightforward. My interests are broad but well-defined (for example, I know that I’m not interested in power electronics, theoretical computer science, or biomedical applications of EECS), and the syllabi/course evaluations tell me most of what I need to know. Some things I’d think about here are:!#@p!#@Finally, I’d filter the catalog down to classes I should take. The two main things I’d think about each class at this point are:!#@p!#@Could I recreate the experience outside of MIT?!#@p!#@One of the main reasons why I chose to attend MIT was because of all the educational resources here that I wouldn’t be able to experience elsewhere, such as:!#@p!#@Given how much MIT tuition costs, I aimed to take full advantage of these resources by prioritizing taking classes that teach things I wouldn’t be able to learn or experience outside of MIT. Hardware-based electrical engineering classes like 6.2600 and 6.2410 above immediately come to mind in this category; as do classes with unique structures and/or topics like 6.5310 (Geometric Folding Algorithms, which involves working with Erik Demaine on open problems in computational origami design).!#@p!#@This is also one of the reasons why I didn’t take many computer science classes like 6.1810 (Operating Systems Engineering). All the lecture notes, assignments, etc. for those classes are available online, and their structures prevent me from receiving meaningful feedback on my work. After all, if I could learn the content at home, why should I come to MIT for it? (To be clear, I’m not saying these are bad classes. I just think they don’t give me as much value as I could get elsewhere at MIT.)!#@p!#@“Usefulness” is a somewhat nebulous concept. Sure, a class is certainly useful if it helps me pass a job interview or teaches me how to use a specific tool in my research, but its usefulness can extend far beyond these “hard” skills.!#@p!#@For example, 6.2060 (Microcomputer Project Laboratory) is a class that, at first glance, doesn’t seem very useful at all. The lab assignments all involve programming an obsolete Intel 8051 microprocessor to perform seemingly mundane tasks like striking a fluorescent lamp. I’ll probably never be asked to program an Intel 8051 again in my career, but I’d still argue that 6.2060 was one of the most useful classes I’ve taken at MIT because it taught me so many “soft” skills that are pervasive in all of engineering, including:!#@p!#@Quoting the syllabus: “Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.”!#@p!#@The most useful classes I’ve taken taught a combination of hard and soft skills. 6.7800 (Inference and Information) is the one that immediately comes to mind (perhaps because it’s still fresh on my mind). Not only did it teach many useful probability/statistics/information theory techniques (which are directly applicable to my job after graduation), but it also greatly improved my intuition for thinking about complex modeling problems.!#@p!#@Back in ye olden days (i.e., three years ago), Course 6 subject numbers were a mess. Unlike other departments like Course 2, which has a sensible 2.001 → 2.002 → … → 2.009 numbering system for the core undergrad sequence, Course 6 seemed to have wacky uncorrelated numbers that you just had to memorize. For example, the sequence of classes about algorithms had the following structure:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-course-numbers-800x385.png]!#@So when Course 6 introduced the new 6-4 major (AI and Decision Making) in 2022, they also introduced a new numbering system to fix this mess, resulting in over 200(!) classes being renumbered. Although this change was quite controversial amongst the upperclassmen (many of us still prefer to use the old numbers), I think it was ultimately a step in the right direction, given how much Course 6 has ballooned in size and scope over the past two decades.!#@p!#@The department has a great page that explains the new numbering system, but the TL;DR is:!#@p!#@For example, here’s how I would read a random course number:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/deciphering-6-2410-800x281.png]!#@And here’s what the algorithms sequence looks like under the new numbering system:!#@p!#@Knowing how the new numbering system works is useful because it provides an easy way to find new classes related to ones you’ve previously taken and enjoyed. For example, if you enjoyed 6.3000 (Signal Processing), there’s a good chance you’d also enjoy 6.3010 (Signals, Systems, and Inference) or 6.3020 (Fundamentals of Music Processing).!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/curseroad-400x388.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eat-your-vegetables-800x556.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eat-your-vegetables-2-800x531.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/old-course-numbers-800x385.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/deciphering-6-2410-800x281.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-i-chose-my-classes/

Answer these 13 questions and we’ll reveal the perfect dorm for you! by Ellie F. '28,What does your favorite dorm animal say about where you should live?,by Ellie F. '28,"May 22, 2025","This started months ago as some joke-turned-blog-idea on the MIT class of 2029 Discord Server, where I was helping out answering questions from the prefrosh. MIT has very strong dorm culture, and each of our dorms has its own traditions, in-jokes, and lifestyles. I thought that writing an interactive Buzzfeed-style quiz would be a fun way to find interesting patterns and learn more about the people in dorms overall.!#@p!#@The plan was to create some questions and disseminate them through dormspam, our undergraduate-wide emailing list. Then, I could analyze the answers and their corresponding dorms to create the quiz for the blogs. Despite multiple months of sitting on this idea, I didn’t start creating questions until the day before the dorm decision form was released for prefrosh (sorry that this quiz is so late lol). I dormspammed the survey in the middle of my Asian Dance Team showcase and watched in awe as responses started rolling in. (I think I got like 50 responses in 10 minutes?? what)!#@p!#@A couple days later, I started the data analysis (instead of studying for finals, of course). Turns out I’m bad at spreadsheets, so I just made a bunch of jank formulas to find each question’s response distribution by dorm. Then, I found an online personality quiz maker and translated those results to the quiz’s answer scoring system. This took longer than it should have.!#@p!#@Here’s the results spreadsheet (it’s a copy) if you want to do your own digging: COOL DATA HERE!#@p!#@Is it true that Baker has the most athletes? 73.1% of Baker residents responded that they were athletes, followed by 37.5% of Maseeh and 28.6% of New Vassar.!#@p!#@While “baby’s first speed rap (l,m,n,o,p)”, with 35.7% of responses, tended to be the crowd’s favorite alphabet section, the East Side dorms, East Campus (EC) and Random, had a marked preference for the “weirdo/goth letters (v,w,x,y,z)”, which won 30.6% of East Side votes.!#@p!#@Maseeh, the closest dorm to campus, seems to love convenience as much as the farthest dorms want it. 50% of Maseeh respondents chose the superpower of being able to travel as quickly as a car, compared to 44.8% for Next House and 50% for Simmons, the two farthest dorms on Dorm Row.!#@p!#@The most ~aesthetic~ dorms were Random Hall with 41.7% for Dark Academia and McCormick with 38.1% for Cottagecore. No other dorms had more votes for one of the listed aesthetics than none of them.!#@p!#@Most dorms love cooking for themselves during Independent Activities Period (IAP), when meal plans are optional for everyone. Baker was the only dorm where any option was selected more than cooking — a whopping 65.3% of Baker respondents chose to eat at Maseeh, compared to only 31.3% of Maseeh respondents. MacGregor is home to the most scavengers, with 41.7% hunting down free food for sustenance. On the other hand, 44.4% of Nexties have given up and simply responded with “food?”.!#@p!#@Only two respondents preferred zero windows (honestly I expected more). Most people showed a strong preference to one or two windows, likely the amount of windows in their own dorm room.

What is the value of college? by David duKor-Jackson,Food for thought in your college search,by David duKor-Jackson,"May 21, 2025","I spent the beginning of this week in the company of a select group of college enrollment leaders and college counselors from across the country and around the world. Spending time in settings like these is personally and professionally affirming, if for no other reason than the fact that they provide a reminder that the vast majority of those who do this work are committed, first and foremost, to helping young people reach their aspirations.!#@p!#@Even though the challenges faced vary from role to role and institution to institution, some common themes emerged. While there were many issues that we wrestled with, the topic that I found most salient revolved around the value of higher education, which frankly is only in question because educational institutions have abdicated their responsibility to articulate the transformative impact that they should be having on every student who passes through their doors.!#@p!#@Whether schools believe that their value is manifest or they are simply preoccupied catering to the whims of a transactional public who view education solely as a means to an end, many seem to have lost the plot.!#@p!#@At MIT, we are mission-forward. Institutional decision making, writ large, and our admission selection process are guided by service to our mission, which I tend to summarize as utilizing our collective energy and intellect to solve the world’s biggest problems, although the full Mission Statement reads…!#@p!#@“The mission of MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.!#@p!#@The Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community. We seek to develop in each member of the MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.”!#@p!#@We begin every information session with a primer on our mission, so I think it would be difficult to come away from a visit with a member of our staff without having an appreciation for the value of an MIT education. While I know the inherent value of an educational experience on this campus, I also believe in the value of educational experiences available on other campuses. My belief, however, is no match for the broad societal skepticism about the ROI on most undergraduate degrees. It is incumbent on all of us to do better. Colleges and universities need to do a better job of centering their missions, specifically as they relate to the impact of their educational experience on their graduates, and prospective students and families need to demand more than a credential certifying that one has met the requirements for a degree.!#@p!#@So students, as you are exploring campuses in the process of building out your list of schools to which you will likely apply, make sure that you are asking substantive questions about the transformative impact of an undergraduate experience and the ways in which an institution’s mission aligns with your own goals for the future, in addition to your questions about dormitories, dining halls and climbing walls.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-is-the-value-of-college/
Am I rural or small-town? by Nicole Cooper,Read on to learn about what a taco bell index is,by Nicole Cooper,"May 19, 2025","Well, are you rural?!#@p!#@You might have heard about the STARS College Network—which stands for Small-Town and Rural Students—and wondered, “Am I from a rural or small town?”. This is an iteration of one of the most common questions I get at college fairs and webinars:!#@p!#@While I know the ideal answer to the question above is a solid “yes” or “no,” rurality is much more nuanced than that. Answering that question without more information can be reductive to your lived experience. However, I can help you think about place and how it shapes your access to resources, your perspective, and your resilience, and the inherent strengths of this experience.!#@p!#@So this is where I come in: because at the end of the day, it’s about your lived experience, not just your zip code.!#@p!#@Understanding rurality and small-town life: Starting with the data!#@p!#@Figuring out what rural and small-town means isn’t as simple as drawing a line on a map. The U.S. Census Bureau defines “rural” as basically everything that isn’t an urban area. Not super helpful, right? The USDA provides further guidance with maps.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-11.24.26 AM-400x329.png]!#@When reading applications, we try our best to get a good sense of the place(s) in which you’ve grown up—reading up on how a place has developed over the last twenty years, using Google Maps to see how far away common resources are (I mentioned Taco Bell earlier because we jokingly call that our Taco Bell Index, but it’s much more than just Taco Bells), or seeing how long it takes most of your neighbors to drive to work.!#@p!#@While they can be a great starting point for us (and for you) to understand the size of your town, and its relation to resources often found in larger cities, these definitions and tools don’t really capture the true essence of what it is like to live in a rural area or a small town (even though I do care about how long it takes you to drive to get a Crunchwrap Supreme). Here at MIT, we don’t refer to rural as “everything else that is left” because these spaces and places are much more than that. They have strengths and texture that bring value to campus communities, that are largely missing (but we are working on changing that!).!#@p!#@Your essays are the next step to understanding your experience, and are a great place to help an admission officer understand your hometown and how it has shaped you beyond the US Census. We focus on your story: how growing up has shaped your perspective, resilience, and problem-solving abilities.!#@p!#@What are we looking for in a small-town or rural area?!#@p!#@When we talk about rural and small-town students, we’re not just hunting for zip codes or checking boxes. We’re valuing the kind of life and how it shapes—the grit, the creativity, and the deep sense of community that comes from growing up in places where everyone knows your name (and probably your dog’s, too).!#@p!#@It is important to think about the shared commonalities of rural and small-towns, like a lack of public transportation, small class sizes, dirt roads, no major airports, or a sport franchise. A place where you are often surrounded by large masses of land, where cows on drives are common, and the state-fair and backyard cookouts make the highlights of the year.!#@p!#@I always say,!#@p!#@These communities are incredibly diverse, each with its own character, strengths, and quirks.!#@p!#@Maybe you live in a town where “traffic” means waiting behind a line of combines during harvest season, being stopped behind a cattle drive, or where your high school’s idea of a college fair is a stack of brochures in the counselor’s office. Perhaps the nearest Taco Bell is a full tank of gas away. Maybe you’ve gotten really good at fixing things yourself because the nearest specialty store is two counties over. Or maybe you’re from a small town where Friday night football is practically a holiday and every face in the bleachers is familiar. You might live in a place with one main street, where the coffee shop is the heartbeat of the community, and your teacher is also your neighbor and your cousin’s basketball coach. Where you don’t have AP courses, and where going to college means going to a 2-year institution (which is great, but not for everyone).!#@p!#@We’re talking about students who live it, students who know what it means to attend a school where AP classes are few and far between, if they exist at all. Where they have to advocate for their classes, drive 30 minutes to their dual credit course, and know what a hardship permit is. Where participating in a robotics competition means borrowing equipment from neighboring districts or building prototypes out of spare parts found in your uncles shop. Where accessing a science lab with proper equipment requires a two-hour drive to the nearest community college.!#@p!#@These are students who travel hours for college fairs or rely on virtual tours because campus visits aren’t feasible and the sight of an Ivy League institution in their hometown is unheard of. It’s about learning to maximize the resources available like joining 4-H or FFA to get hands-on experience with agriculture and engineering, volunteering at local clinics to explore healthcare, or building makeshift studios in basements for art and design projects.
Perhaps some of these descriptors resonate with you.!#@p!#@Your story matters and what this means for you:!#@p!#@These experiences, no matter how small they seem, bring something valuable to MIT. They offer perspectives that are grounded, innovative, and refreshingly different. When you’re used to making the most of what you have, you see possibility where others might not. For example, some students talk about using scrap materials to build a clubhouse, fix a fence, or repair farm equipment or organizing community events (like prom) in the high school gym because it’s the largest gathering space in town.These are all characteristics that mold a perspective. Rural and small-town aren’t just map dots. They’re mindsets, a way of thinking creatively that adds to the classroom in innovative ways.!#@p!#@TLDR; if you’re wondering, “Does knowing how to drive a tractor or starting a community garden in a town with one stoplight matter to admission officers?”—the answer is a resounding YES. Tell us your rural and small-town story. Take advantage of the STARS College Network and the free programs that MIT and other institutions plan and host to help you with the college application process so you can better learn how your unique strengths gained from living in a rural area or small-town are important in the process. Share what your place, your home, your community has taught you. It doesn’t have to look like anyone else’s. Because just like every small town is its own world, every student’s story is its own adventure. We want to hear yours.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-11.24.26 AM-400x329.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/am-i-rural-or-small-town/

reviewing my classes this semester by Gloria Z. '26,but unthoroughly,by Gloria Z. '26,"May 17, 2025","This semester, due to a careening series of events⁠01 , I took an ill-advised courseload of 8 classes, totaling 96 units. In the spirit of procrastinating finals studying, here are my thoughts on each of them :-).!#@p!#@(1) incredible, spectacular, no notes!#@p!#@These were my favorite classes this semester! I found them really rewarding, with a generally fair amount of assignments, and they covered material that I had little to no exposure to beforehand.!#@p!#@11.067: Land Use Law and Politics: Race, Place, and Law!#@p!#@This course surveyed US property law through a legal and social justice lens; specifically, we covered property, land use, equal protection, civil rights, fair housing, and local government law. Each week’s readings consisted of a set of relevant court cases, plus the occasional theoretical or philosophical legal reading. We went over a lot of key constitutional rights, challenges, and debates, and apart from those questions being very… relevant in recent months, it felt really cool to have the tools to understand and analyze key court cases in American history. The professor was also a great lecturer and very engaging!!#@p!#@For our final project, my teammates Sabine, Emily, Amira, Ari, and I made this unfolding zine that summarized some of the core themes of the class:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pic1-800x800.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pic2-800x800.png]!#@MAS.s63: Recreating the Past!#@p!#@Taught by members of the Future Sketches group in the Media Lab, this class centered on computational and new media art from the past few decades. Every week, we learned about a specific artist or set of artists, then, as homework, recreated an artwork by them using modern-day frameworks and computational tools. I feel like the class really made me understand what was so entrancing about computation back when computers were first being developed — things that feel completely normal to us now like motion graphics were completely new and magical at the time. I got to try out new frameworks like p5.js and paper.js and make some neat stuff! It was also a tiny class, only about 3 students each time, so each session felt more like a discussion and shared art appreciation session than a traditional lecture.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kazimir-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/T02319_10-800x805.jpg]!#@(2) so frustrating but so rewarding!#@p!#@These were my two coding/engineering classes this semester, and they definitely delivered on that front. I’ve never stared at VSCode so much in my life.!#@p!#@6.5840: Distributed Computer Systems Engineering!#@p!#@A distributed system is a collection of computers that interact with each other in order to achieve some goal. For example, the Google search engine uses distributed technologies, because there’s no way one computer can handle that much search traffic; instead, a massive network of computers communicate in order to serve millions of consistent search results per second. However, this interconnectedness brings about a host of problems: what happens if messages between computers are dropped, duplicated, or interfered with mid-send? What if some computers crash and others have to 1) recognize the crash and 2) pick up the slack?!#@p!#@Turns out, a lot of interesting algorithms and network architectures have been developed in the past thirty years to address these issues, and this class consisted of a series of labs in which we implemented some of those solutions. In particular, the most difficult system by far to implement was called Raft – a “consensus” algorithm that enables a set of computers to agree on a shared sequence of client operations. Omitting the grimy technical details, I’ll just say that Raft was extremely hard to debug due to the nondeterministic(ish) nature of the program and sheer length of debug logs… I have never felt so defeated by a single file with less than 700 lines of code. However, we made it through 🤞🤞 with a better appreciation of the technologies underpinning the fast and speedy internet we all take for granted. I also learned (somewhat) how to code in Golang.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/raftdebug2-400x621.png]!#@6.1100: Computer Language Engineering!#@p!#@In this class we wrote a compiler! You ever wonder how something like this:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/codesnippet-400x347.png]!#@gets turned into something that a computer can execute? After all, a computer is just an amalgamation of cleverly arranged circuitry; it has no notion of what an “if statement” or “for loop” is. Thus, a compiler is a program that does the hard work of translating “high level” code such as Python or C++ into hardware-specific Assembly code and subsequently a binary executable (1s and 0s).!#@p!#@This entire class consisted of one project (the eponymous compiler), so the difficult part was structuring that large, complicated codebase in a way that was 1) flexible 2) easily maintainable and 3) relatively quick to implement. It was honestly a lot of fun – frustrating at times, but (at least for me) nowhere near as soul-crushing as distributed systems was. It helped that my teammates Selena and Andrew were really great! This was also my first time using Rust. In celebration of finishing the class, we made custom cyanotyped shirts :-).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cyanodog-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cyano-800x800.jpg]!#@(3) what the box said!#@p!#@These classes were fine; they delivered on what they promised, so I don’t really have any specific gripes or praises. I’m glad I took them!!#@p!#@4.250: Introduction to Urban Design and Development!#@p!#@This is the intro undergraduate DUSP class, surveying topics such as street networks and neighborhoods, the history of zoning in the US, and city planning movements like New Urbanism. I think this is one of those classes that is really necessary and important but maybe not so scintillating on a daily basis (as intro classes often are). However, I did really enjoy some of the guest lectures, particularly one that focused on the failures (or perceived thereof) of public housing projects in the US. At the end of the semester, we went on a walking tour of two nearby sites – Cambridge Crossing and the Seaport District – where the actual city planners who worked on those projects came and talked us through the decisions behind each location’s developments, which was really insightful.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jaywalking-3-800x600.png]!#@11.c35: Interactive Data Visualization and Society!#@p!#@In 11.c35, we worked in teams to create a web-based “visualization journey” (think journalism-style interactive data stories, but not nearly as polished) about housing trends in the greater Boston area. The class was partnered with Metropolitan Area Planning Council (the regional planning agency in this area), so MAPC representatives would provide feedback periodically on the direction of each project. Our team focused specifically on the subtheme of corporate speculation, so our data visualizations centered on ballooning rent prices, eviction rates, and the impact that corporate landlords have on the housing market. Overall it was a fun class, and although I wasn’t as excited about the day-to-day work of web development, the housing concepts and design/storytelling aspects of the assignments were pretty new and interesting.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/c35_example_vis-800x928.png]!#@(4) good classes I’m sure but I just wasn’t that into it!#@p!#@18.212: Algebraic Combinatorics!#@p!#@Unfortunately I could not tell you much about algebraic combinatorics despite having taken this class… I do think the material was interesting enough, but I just didn’t have the time or energy to fully appreciate it beyond doing the (only four) problem sets.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18212meme-800x450.jpg]!#@6.4110: Representation, Inference, and Reasoning in AI!#@p!#@Broadly, this class explored various ways to represent the process of “decision-making” with feedback and controls, primarily through the lens of robotics.

Scootah Hockey by Ellie F. '28,"a sport of tradition, friendship, and raw athleticism",by Ellie F. '28,"May 13, 2025","Every few seasons, the hallowed concrete walls of Simmons Hall come alive with the echoes of laughter and plastic pucks and the ritual shouts of “ON YOUR SCOOTAH!” This season, it was our fair and brave president Eugenie who led this time-honored tradition: the sacred game of Scootah Hockey.!#@p!#@Scootah Hockey, while rich in history and strategy, is a simple game to play. Each team has three to four players on at a time, each of whom rides on a noble steed–those scooters that you used to sit your butt on in PE class. Each player was also gifted a weapon of pure magic by the name of “short hockey stick”, with which they may launch the puck around the rink, and hopefully, into the goal. However, each goal is guarded by a vigilant goalie with the power to apprehend nearby pucks and send them back out into the fray.!#@p!#@Clearly, Scootah Hockey has no power without its teams, and so, the tangled maze of Simmons Hall floors split up into their respective GRA sections and painted their team spirit into the very fabric upon their backs. We also ate some yummy snacks while making our shirts.!#@p!#@Now, the time to play draws near. Each night, three contests were held, points tallied, and glory awarded with the blow of the big plastic horn thing we have for some reason. Those who came to spectate the festivities were met with different feasts each day–fried chicken, sushi, mochinuts, brownies, and more. Gathered around the walls of the rink were GRAs and friends cheering for whichever team they owed their loyalty. My debut on the rink was chaotic, and despite good resistance from our opponents, my teammates and I won 1 to 0. Afterwards, I felt aches in muscles as of yet never discovered.!#@p!#@The revelry continued in this way for five nights, and then the final bracket was revealed to much fanfare. My team, C Tower, was seeded first, and with the sunrise on Saturday came the last playoffs. In a heartbreaking turn of events, we were defeated by A Tower, a worthy team, which, in the final seconds of the final, won the Scootah Hockey Championship. And thus, another tournament of Scootah Hockey, with its victories and defeats, would be written into the annals of Simmons Hall.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/makin-shirts-1000x1333.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C-tower-team-photo-1000x750.jpeg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/makin-shirts-1000x1333.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C-tower-team-photo-1000x750.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/scootah-hockey/

Shoulder Season Treat by David duKor-Jackson,A little something for rising seniors to jump-start their exploration of MIT,by David duKor-Jackson,"May 12, 2025","I have heard the term “Shoulder Season” to characterize the time between peak and off-peak travel seasons, and the fleetingly brief periods of time here in the Northeast between heating and cooling seasons (or vice versa). I am, however, going to co-op the term to also apply to the time when the Admissions office isn’t quite finished working with the current crop of graduating seniors but is also engaged with the the next group of rising seniors (and other underclass students) who are anxious to get a start on the college exploration process.

For that later group I have a little treat… OK, that might be a bit of an exaggeration. I don’t know that it is remotely treat like, even though it has pretty effectively compiled my best advice over the years into an easily digestible and utterly listenable 51 minutes.

Recently, I had the privilege and pleasure of sitting down with Dr. John Durante, a parent, educator, author, and host of the College Admissions Process Podcast. We had a great conversation about MIT, our selection process and how we are thinking about changes on the horizon of the college admissions landscape. It is definitely worth checking out, if I don’t say so myself.!#@p!#@I will point out that the podcast episode that I appear in is #297, so there are many, many other great discussions that one could also explore.  If you go all that way back to episode #260 from October 28, 2024, you can even hear from one of MIT’s former Director of Admissions extolling the virtues of the Liberal Arts.!#@p!#@Happy listening.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/shoulder-season-treat/
MIT is a jock school by Emiko P. '25,the secret is out,by Emiko P. '25,"May 11, 2025","As MIT Admissions’ one and only “jockblogger,” I have decided it’s my task—no, my duty—to finally say what needs to be said: MIT is a jock school.!#@p!#@Yes, that MIT. The one that has swept the Putnam competition for the last five years, the one with lunar rovers and Nobel Laureates and famously nerdy culture.!#@p!#@But also: the MIT where 25% of the undergraduates participate in one of the 33 varsity sports. The MIT where, underneath all the academic success, lurks an astounding amount of athletic success.!#@p!#@Let me prove it to you.!#@p!#@MIT is the most successful school in our conference, the NEWMAC, with 199 conference titles. And just to be clear, this isn’t one team carrying everyone else on their back, but success across the board.!#@p!#@Take that in: your MIT friends on sports teams are part of some pretty phenomenal programs with a long history of being a feared team in the NEWMAC. I’m sure the friends and families of these other NEWMAC schools often scoff and say, “Why are you so afraid of MIT? Those nerds? There’s no way they can play sports!” And I bet these NEWMAC athletes are so very tired of that being everyone’s response, because some of them literally dread playing MIT every year—because they know the truth: that MIT is a jock school. They know that these nerds are faster, stronger, and grittier than they are. They know that these beavers can bite.!#@p!#@And while the NEWMAC demonstrates success at a regional scale, you might be thinking: Surely there is not this much success at a national level, too?!#@p!#@WRONG!!#@p!#@The limits of MIT athletics cannot simply be bound to the regional level.!#@p!#@To me, the coolest stat about MIT athletics is this: we have more Academic All-Americans than anyone in the country. With 444 honorees as of August 2024, MIT dominates the lead, outpacing schools like Stanford, Notre Dame, and Alabama. The Academic All-American award is one of the most prestigious awards that a student-athlete can receive—won by the likes of Caitlin Clark, Katie Ledecky, Patrick Mahomes, and Peyton Manning!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-170955-1-400x440.png]!#@MIT also has 22 NCAA Elite 90 Award winners, which recognizes the student-athlete with the highest cumulative GPA who has reached the national championship level of the NCAA tournament. This is such a cool award to win, because it’s the epitome of brains and brawn. Contending for a national championship and having a 4.0 GPA? Now that’s a flex.!#@p!#@It’s not every day you see athletics like these. Even I, as a recruited soccer athlete, didn’t realize just how much of a powerhouse MIT was. But if you think about it, it makes sense. Students come to MIT for the greatest possible academic experience, and if you’re an elite athlete who also happens to be smart, the draw of an amazing academic school is too much to resist. MIT is a magnet, drawing all the academically motivated jocks straight to it.!#@p!#@I learned that MIT was a jock school by living in it. I saw my friends winning nationally acclaimed awards; I saw my soccer teammate win the NCAA Woman of the Year award; I heard the other teams grumble as our soccer team swept the conference 11–0 this year; I saw my classmates pubbing their conference finals, and I saw the new shirts they would wear the following week with NEWMAC Champion spelled out in bright letters; I saw how girls in my sorority would leave for a weekend and return as national champions.!#@p!#@I’ve learned through firsthand experiences that MIT is a jock school—but we’re past the point where that should surprise anyone. By now, MIT athletics has earned its reputation. When people step onto campus, they should know that they’re entering not only an academic powerhouse, but an athletic one as well.!#@p!#@Let the truth be known from here on out: MIT is a jock school.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sd-champ-1-800x448.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cross-country-womens-800x445.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mtennis-800x411.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/football-800x504.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wvball-2-800x450.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-170955-1-400x440.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sd-champ-1-800x448.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cross-country-womens-800x445.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mtennis-800x411.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/football-800x504.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wvball-2-800x450.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-is-a-jock-school/
Dining Hall Alchemy by Andi Q. '25,The art of turning cereal and chicken tenders into slightly tastier cereal and chicken tenders,by Andi Q. '25,"May 11, 2025","One of the many things I love about MIT’s dining halls is that they are buffet-style, allowing you to get as much food as you want from several “stations” around the dining hall. Indeed, an easy way to level up your MIT dining experience is by experimenting with exotic food combinations across different stations. Although they are designed to be self-contained and you can get full meals from any single station, there’s nothing stopping you from getting food from several of them at once.!#@p!#@When I’m not in a rush, I find it helpful to do a quick scan of the entire dining hall first and think about what might go well together instead of immediately committing to the grill or comfort⁠01 station. In doing so, I’m often surprised by how much the salad bar has to offer. For example, the stir-fry station at Simmons only has a selection of 8-10 different vegetables (which is admittedly already a lot), but you can double that number using the salad bar.!#@p!#@Some easy combinations that my friends and I have enjoyed over the years are as follows:!#@p!#@Mixing foods from the same station can result in surprising new combinations too. Here’s a simple cereal combo recipe I learned from my friend Amee S. ’25:!#@p!#@Yields: 1 bowl of above-average cereal!#@p!#@One of the best things about New Vassar dining is that you can get custom-made and toasted sandwiches for lunch there. Although none of the other dining halls have a dedicated sandwich station, they usually have most of the ingredients you’d need for a sandwich scattered around the dining hall.!#@p!#@Taking the above mixing idea a step further, you can create some ridiculously elaborate sandwiches, such as the one in the recipe below (also suggested by Amee S. ’25):!#@p!#@Yields: One sandwich that I have been told resembles something you can buy at the Dunkin’ in the student center!#@p!#@But if that’s too much work for you, here are some easier sandwich recipes my friends and I have used:!#@p!#@To toast my sandwiches, I often use the toaster ovens found in the lounges around Simmons. Note that this requires me to leave the dining hall, so I usually only do this if I get a to-go box (e.g., during late-night dining where that’s the only option).!#@p!#@Of course, I can’t include “alchemy” in the title of this post without mentioning drink mixes! The mix-every-drink-in-the-dining-hall drink is a classic, but here are a few more… sophisticated options I enjoy:!#@p!#@While writing this post, Amee S. ’25 suggested yet another… recipe(?) to include. It’s so ridiculous yet simultaneously brilliant, so I couldn’t possibly leave it out.!#@p!#@Yields: 1 to 3 new squirrel friends!#@p!#@The dining halls like to experiment with… interesting food combinations too!

particularly egregious examples I’ve experienced:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.54.16-800x238.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7796-800x270.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.52.23-e1746969789388.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.49.27-800x367.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.52.59-e1746972106705-800x662.jpeg]!#@(To be clear, these images were just display glitches on the menu, but I wouldn’t be too surprised if these did actually end up in the dining hall.)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.54.16-800x238.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7796-800x270.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.52.23-e1746969789388.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.49.27-800x367.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-06-at-10.52.59-e1746972106705-800x662.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/dining-hall-alchemy/
SHE CAMPUS ON MY PREVIEW TIL I WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! by Angie F. '28,my freshman cpw post turned east campus love letter,by Angie F. '28,"May 6, 2025","My Campus Preview Weekend (MIT’s admitted students weekend, also known as CPW) was a whirlwind of constant adventure. What I wouldn’t have guessed was that the first CPW I’d spend as an actual student would be pretty much the same: after all, flowers were finally starting to bloom en masse in Cambridge, and the prefrosh excitement around me was so palpable it was hard not to forget that I had psets for a couple of days. Here’s some of what I got up to!!#@p!#@Name 2^n Women: Dorm culture is quite important at MIT: you can choose how much you do or don’t participate in it, but it’ll always be there if you want your social life to be centralized where you live, as many do. As a result, every dorm hosts their own CPW events to give incoming students a taste of their unique brand of MIT living. My dorm for next semester (and probably all the ones that follow it) East Campus (EC), is currently closed for renovations, but we still had an incredibly large and vibrant selection of events. This was one of them, and my friend Brianna and I got to co-run it. Our original goal for the event was to see which prefrosh could name the most women: participants would be given 30 seconds to list off as many women as they could. Those who fell below a certain threshold would have to eat a sardine (a punishment inspired by our good friend Ben, who loves sardines and making other people eat them), but anyone who managed to rise to the occasion and name a sufficient number of women would be rewarded with Insomnia cookies. However, we both had a 6.1200⁠01 midterm that ended at the event start time, so when I got there after an extra slow defeated walk through the tunnels (6.1200 is arguably the class I’m worst at), it became clear to me that our friends who we’d asked to help us get the event started had had different ideas. We ended up working together to write down the names of as many distinct women as we could on the classroom’s massive blackboards, reaching a whooping 2^9 (coincidentally as many dumplings as we made at 2^n dumplings over IAP). Admittedly, the event ended up being comprised of more excited upperclassmen than prefrosh, but it lifted me out of my post-midterm slump as I was reminded of one of my favorite parts of the EC community: its ability to turn any ridiculous idea into a bright and big reality, to commit to even the stupidest bit.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/signal-2025-04-18-012958-400x300.jpeg]!#@Meet the Bloggers: This was so much fun! All the bloggers got together to hang out with prospective students and answer questions about blogging and MIT life. I remember wanting to attend this event so badly during my CPW but getting caught up in something else, so I’m glad I got to see what it was like from the other side. My main motivation to apply to write for the blog was to help show prospective students that MIT could be a place for them, too, and meeting some of these people in real life made me very, very happy. I talked to TALL BOY AND SHORT GIRL (I told you guys to keep an eye out on the blogs) and ate some really good pie of the meat and non-meat variety. What more could you ask for?!#@p!#@Underwater Battlebots: I helped run this event for Arcturus, MIT’s autonomous robotics team! While I unfortunately had to leave this iteration of Underwater Battlebots early to help with another event, I’d led the event in full for Splash, a program that allows MIT students to run a class on whatever they want for middle and high schoolers, and can therefore still write about it: kids divide into teams and receive a SeaPerch kit, which gives them everything they need to run an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. After an hour of building, they compete in a bracket-style Battlebots competition in the test tank at Sea Grant, the lab that Arcturus does most of their work in. Each team has two minutes to push rubber ducks and floating rings into their endzone, keep floating lily pads out, and pop the balloons in the other team’s endzone; additionally, catching a toy fish that swims through the pool gives you ten points (all other objects have absolute point values less than or equal to three). At the end, the points from the objects in each endzone are tallied up, and the winning team continues on in the bracket. It’s a whole lot of fun, and a great introduction to ocean engineering. I currently run outreach for Arcturus, but have had so much fun with it that I’ll most likely be joining the autonomy subteam this coming fall :) I’d encourage any prefrosh interested in building cool stuff to check them out!!#@p!#@(Additionally, I feel compelled to mention that East Campus is arguably the most build-y living group on campus, since I’ve been talking about them all blog post but haven’t had an opportunity to share this essential [and, in my opinion, very cool] part of the dorm’s culture. For example, here’s an old EC build one of my hallmates found yesterday: an elaborate dorm room automation system featuring a security system, a touch screen command center [keep in mind that this was way before iPads were a thing], automatic blind and door controls, and… a party mode? We also build a fort and a rollercoaster for all of campus to enjoy every year before the start of fall semester. Whether you’re looking for hands to help you build anything you can think of or ears to listen to you talk about it, you’ll find no shortage of them in East Campus.)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1974-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0552-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0571-800x1067.jpeg]!#@CryoFAC: When I remember my CPW, I think about long days spent running back and forth through campus and across the bridge, the sunrise peeking through my blinds as I got ready for bed, a million gazillion introductions, too much free food and boba to count, lock-picking, the occasional sunny moment on Killian ( CPW weather machine was out of order for my year⁠02 )… and, of course, liquid nitrogen ice cream on Kresge lawn. What I didn’t know back then was that the event that filled me with the prefrosh giddiness I’d get every time I was faced with something that seemed so quintessentially MIT was CryoFAC, which has been run by East Campus for 23 years and counting, which meant that I’d eventually help run it myself. We prepared the batter beforehand (I made two batches of butter pecan, and 32 batches of vanilla!), then prepared the ice cream on the spot for prefrosh by pouring liquid nitrogen into the batter-filled bowl and mixing as quickly as possible. One of the most important parts of CryoFAC has nothing to do with the ice cream at all: every year, East Campus chooses a freshman⁠03 to be Box Boy, who runs around in a box trying to bring people to the event. We also had some very talented friends DJing, which made it very easy to lock in on mixing ice cream for two straight hours on two straight days.!#@p!#@Overall, this might have been my favorite event. I spent my CPW walking around campus bewildered: I’d gone to visit for HMMT before, but this was my first time feeling the real MIT, the rhythm pulsing through the heart of the campus, the first whiffs of the patterns I’d eventually know like the back of my hand. Every time I met a group of upperclassmen friends who freely offered up solid advice and told us about their hopes and dreams with laser sharp clarity, peeked into a lecture hall and saw a professor writing what might as well have been gibberish on the board, blinked through dozens of events that would’ve been the most exciting things I’d done all month at home but were just one of countless crazy beautiful adventures here, all I’d feel was this longing to enter the world I’d been swept into. As small a part of my CPW as it was, the liquid nitrogen ice cream stayed in my mind because of this: MIT seemed like this impossible place where anything could happen, and the fact that such a silly, awesome thing that had definitely just once been a few students’ late night idea was so real and right in front of my face was proof of that. Being on the other side of the table in my bright orange jumpsuit reminded me of how magical this place was to me during that weekend in my senior year of high school, and how I’d finally carved a place out in that magic for myself.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photo-Apr-21-2025-12-00-00-AM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photo-Apr-21-2025-12-00-00-AM-33-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2044-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2048-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/signal-2025-04-19-160137-800x1067.jpeg]!#@Stay Woke Rave: Finally, my CPW ended with East Campus’ STAY WOKE RAVE! As the automatic party mode might have given away, lots of people in East Campus love DJing and dancing all night long. I myself am no exception (I’m taking a class to learn how to DJ next semester!). My friends Dylan, James, and Niko each DJed a set while the rest of us danced. At the few parties I went to in high school, no one really danced, and this was disappointingly true for some of the ones I attended at college too. Which makes sense, I guess: lots of my friends who I’d talked to about it were too nervous about “doing it wrong” to try it even if they’d wanted to. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case at East Campus, not just for dancing but for everything else: it’s easy for me to feel welcome to try new things and do badly at them around my EC friends. Being in this kind of environment mean that it wasn’t uncommon for me to dance with just one or two friends and have an amazing time, so being in such a comparatively large crowd with such good music was exhilarating….!#@p!#@…maybe a little too exhilarating, actually. During Niko’s set, I felt my foot land awkwardly on the ground and fell. My friends helped me get to a bench outside, where I realized that I’d twisted my ankle. I ended up covered in sweat and holding a soda bottle to my swollen foot as my other one tapped impatiently on the ground: I wasn’t very convinced I’d twisted it too hard and was pretty miffed about being off the dance floor for the rest of the night. My friends had come out to sit with me, but I’d fairly quickly sent them back to the party since I didn’t want them to miss out on my behalf, leaving me all alone. Eventually, I heard footsteps and looked up to see my friend Will. We locked eyes and he didn’t say a word, just pushed a cart he’d rolled out from the party room over at me. A smile broke out across my face.!#@p!#@I hoisted myself onto the cart and laughed my way back to the room, where I was able to keep dancing with my friends as I got rolled around. Soon, Niko’s set came to an end and the lights came back on, giving everyone a full view of my ankle. As the last partygoers gaped in shock, I finally admitted to myself that okay, maybe I had twisted it a little. I couldn’t put any weight on it, but thankfully, someone found a wheelbarrow in the corner of the room, and I was carted all the way to my friends’ suite in Burton Conner, which I decided would be a safer place to stay than my single in case I still couldn’t walk when I woke up. But I was sure I’d be able to sleep it off. The next day came around and I had not, in fact, slept it off. I half-Ubered half-hopped to MIT Health (after rejecting my friends’ many offers for help getting there #woops) and they told me it was probably fractured, but the x-ray revealed that it was only badly sprained! Woohoo! That evening, I crutched over to Baker dining and was welcomed with a round of applause from my East Campus friends, who deemed me “EC’s strongest soldier.” If you see me hobbling around campus in one of those big boots and an EC shirt, just know that I have no regrets.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2008-400x533.jpeg]!#@One of my favorite memories from the two weekends I spent at MIT for Sin LiMITe⁠04 and CPW was sitting in a booth at Cambridge Pizza (which would eventually become my most frequented late night food spot, a favorite place to wrap up evenings of adventures with friends) in an overly fancy dress with some upperclassmen, rapt as they gave me advice and I hung onto their every word. Looking from the outside in (and even from the inside in sometimes), MIT can seem like a scary place, but I’ve always been able to hold onto the sense of comfort that night gave me. There have been people looking out for me from the beginning, so how could it not all turn out okay? I’m glad to have been able to play so many roles during CPW and be a first MIT memory for so many people, especially since I look back on mine so fondly. To every prefrosh I did and did not meet: the best is yet to come.!#@p!#@:)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/signal-2025-04-18-012958-400x300.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1974-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0552-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0571-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photo-Apr-21-2025-12-00-00-AM-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photo-Apr-21-2025-12-00-00-AM-33-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2044-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2048-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/signal-2025-04-19-160137-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2008-400x533.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/she-campus-on-my-preview-til-i-weekend/

Thinking Outside of Absolutes by Richard O. '28,A short thought piece on thinking about thinking,by Richard O. '28,"April 30, 2025","For a while now, I’ve had this realization that I tend to overthink a lot. And I think this is something a lot of people can relate to. There are always moments when you’re presented with a decision, and naturally, you want to make a choice that leads to the least regret. So, how else do you ensure you make the best choice? You think about it. You imagine yourself in different worlds and try to predict the outcome based on the choices you make. You then make a choice. If that choice turns out as you expect, you may be satisfied. If it doesn’t, you may not be satisfied and regret not making another choice because you may feel you didn’t pay attention to the details. So then the next time around, you pay attention to more details. You learn from your mistakes and get better at making predictions for outcomes. But every time you consider more details, you do more thinking.!#@p!#@In the past few months, I’ve found myself thinking about this loop of thinking in almost every interaction, conversation, assignment submission, and choice that I’ve made. And by thinking about this, I’ve started to realize that I tend to trap myself in this view of the world, where everything is absolute. A view of the world where I feel if I don’t make a specific choice when I think I need to make it, there will be a domino effect of consequences that I will regret later. And from this, I’ve found that I started to constrict myself to an imaginary list of instructions that I would need to follow in order to be sure I follow the best predictions from my decisions. (i.e., if I don’t finish this assignment now, then I can’t go to event A tomorrow, which will prevent me from doing event B, which will have some other consequence C, and so on). Even as I write this blog, I question how different word choices and sentences I use will convey my thoughts to those who end up reading this, and whether that will have consequences on how my blog impacts those people, and so on. But in overthinking about overthinking (overthinking squared?), I’ve realized that thinking too much makes me forget about what it means to just appreciate everything.!#@p!#@Like the Alan Watts quote goes:!#@p!#@For me, I’ve found that in trying to perfect everything about my day to day life, whether that be completing all my given tasks for a day or using the most expressive choice of words when having a conversation with someone, I forget that reality isn’t supposed to be like a Hollywood movie where every scene follows some cliche plot line or a math problem where everything is optimized. Sometimes, things happen that are meant to make your story different. Sometimes things happen that really do make life feel like a movie. But nothing is ever supposed to be “perfect”. There are always going to be days when things will simply not go as planned. Or days where things will feel overwhelming. Or days where it feels like things are just moving too fast. But having these days doesn’t make your life any less beautiful than it already is.!#@p!#@So, taking all this, I’ve started to think about approaching everything I think about differently. Instead of imagining the world like some binary machine that only prints out “success” or “regret” every time I make a choice, I’ve found it much more useful to imagine the world like a story generator. Every choice acts like a prompt for a new plot. These stories depend on each other, but no story itself is the whole story. It just keeps on going. Bringing new twists and turns based on our choices. And using this perspective, it then becomes easy for me to recognize why I tend to overthink a lot – and it’s because I’m always afraid that one of these prompts will send the story generator downhill and take it to a point where no new prompt I make will produce a story where I feel successful. But this view depends on the assumption that the story generator is absolute – i.e., the story generator generates ALL possible stories – but it can’t. Because the world is so vast and unpredictable, there are always opportunities for us to find ways to change our stories.!#@p!#@So, all of this to say, I feel it’s important to remember that life is not absolute. It’s dynamic. It’s beautiful. It’s unpredictable. It’s crazy. It’s amusing. And it’s always changing. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with thinking deeply about your choices and decisions, but I think, for me, the notion that my decisions in every moment of every day are the final deciders for the future was something that I needed to think about differently. Nothing that happens now will restrict what you can change later because people always have the ability to learn and do new things. And I feel recognizing that we also have this ability to think outside of absolutes is something that can really help you to appreciate the ups and downs and in betweens of life for making us the people that we are.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9173-1-scaled.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9173-1-scaled.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thinking-outside-of-absolutes/
Behind the Scenes of MIT Gala by Gloria Z. '26,liveblog - how a fashion show is made!,by Gloria Z. '26,"April 27, 2025","Over the past three years, I’ve been on the organizing board for MIT Gala, our student-run fashion show! Originally conceptualized in 2023 as the launch event for Infinite Magazine, the annual event has since spun out into something much larger, including a student arts showcase, live music, and of course the titular runway show. Planning MIT Gala is a yearlong effort, culminating in one joyful night of celebrating art and design at MIT. In fact–today’s the day of Gala 2025: April 27th! Setup begins at 8AM, and the event starts at 5PM, so come with me as we go behind the scenes to see how a fashion show is made.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/texture_4_5_instagram_size-400x500.png]!#@(Before we begin–this is the amazing team getting it done: sophia, aimee, layla, pria, mich, vieyiti, jessica, selena, sophie, lindsay, julia, maggie, michelle, eliana, joanne, andy, & me!)!#@p!#@9:30AM – In the student center, Mich is in the midst of running the first of three modeling workshops for everyone that will be walking the runway today. I stop by to say hi and snap a couple pics. All the models are dressed in all black, learning how to walk on beat and pose and turn.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/930-modelworkshop-1-800x600.jpg]!#@10AM – Over at the Media Lab, where MIT Gala will be held on the 6th floor, set design (Maggie + Julia + Lindsay) is hard at work setting up the runway with a border of iridescent fabric and string lights. The rest of the team is putting down tablecloths, working out logistics, and setting up the AV system. An Area 4 coffee/breakfast order is also in the works…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2955-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/settinguprunway-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2953-800x600.jpg]!#@10:30AM – Laptop Ensemble, who will be performing the music for the runway portion of Gala, is starting to set up their equipment and test the audio system, armed with an impressive array of synths, cables, and Cool Looking Audio Gear. E33—who will be doing all the lighting—has also just arrived with a cart full of expensive looking projection lights, black boxes of Technical Stuff, and even thicker cables. In the meantime, I’m trying to figure out how the very intimidating AV box works…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2960-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2956-800x1067.jpg]!#@11AM – Michelle is setting up the tripod to film the runway, and our breakfast order is here!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2965-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2964-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2967-800x600.jpg]!#@12PM – Designers are filtering in to drop off their garments in the back room, and artists who are displaying things in the gallery are coming to install their work on the tables and walls.

It really depends on the person, but to have some semblance of structure, I loosely based my ranking off of these definitions:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/generated_image-4-17-400x229.png]!#@I’ll explain the reasoning for these rankings below in my four-year class roadmap! (Also, I clearly couldn’t bear to put anything in the F tier lol. That’s mean)!#@p!#@Calculus I/II Accelerated (18.01A/18.02A) → Rank B!#@p!#@This class was an accelerated version of Calc 1 and 2, cramming the classes into a semester + IAP. Things I remember really well: staying up until 3 am finishing a PSET with 15 other kids stuffed in a New Vassar study room, being on campus during my first snowy Boston IAP, sitting in the back three rows of 26-100 with the soccer girls and the football team. Things I don’t remember as much: calculus.!#@p!#@Physics I (8.01) → Rank B!#@p!#@A General Institute Requirement (GIR). Made the mistake of taking this class at 9 am. Often fell asleep during virtual Friday Problem Solving.!#@p!#@Principles of Chemical Science (5.111) → Rank D!#@p!#@Another GIR. I’m just not the biggest fan of chemistry.!#@p!#@Becoming Human: Ancient Perspectives on the Good Life (CC.110) → Rank C!#@p!#@This was a philosophy class in the freshman year learning community Concourse, which is a community for students with an interest in the blend of STEM and humanities.!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: Freshman fall was Pass No Record—I was playing college sports for the first time, had just joined my sorority, and was getting to know Bawston.!#@p!#@Introduction to CS and Programming using Python (6.100L) → Rank A!#@p!#@This is the extended, full-semester version of the intro Python coding class that usually takes half a semester. I had never coded before, but being surrounded by code wizard classmates inspired me, and this ended up being the singular most useful class I ever took at MIT!!#@p!#@Introduction to Psychology (9.00) → Rank C!#@p!#@At this time, I was pretty sure I’d be a Course 9. However, this class was virtual that semester, so I ended up pretty unengaged with 9.00.!#@p!#@Physics II (8.02) → Rank D!#@p!#@I took the Concourse version of this class, and I found it so hard for some reason?!? I like physics, but found it pretty tough to wrap my head around electricity and magnetism the way it was explained in this class.!#@p!#@Spanish IV (21G.704) → Rank B!#@p!#@You may think technical classes at MIT are tough, but just wait until you take a language class. You meet four days a week, and there’s homework every day. But that means you learn a lot! I love languages, and I tested into Spanish 4 because of my AP scores in high school. It was also a MISTI requirement, because I would be going to Spain that summer!!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: I declared Brain and Cognitive Science (Course 9) as my major at the end of this semester, then went to Madrid to do computational neuroscience research about emotions! I abruptly switched my major that summer because I didn’t enjoy my research very much. Here is a blog about that whole thought process. I was having the very scary thought that “what if I come to MIT and never create anything?” So, I declared Course 2.!#@p!#@Inventing the Samurai (21G.554) → Rank B!#@p!#@Pre-Meiji Restoration early Japanese history class. My family in Japan was a samurai family, so this was so cool to learn about.!#@p!#@Differential Equations (18.03) → Rank C!#@p!#@Chill class in terms of grading, but I didn’t absorb the content long-term.!#@p!#@Mechanics and Materials I (2.001) → Rank D!#@p!#@I found myself struggling to care in this class. The way beams bend and materials stretch are interesting on the surface, but in practice I was just pretty bored. Also, I bombed the tests haha. I’m just not the best test-taker. However, I hope this shows you that even if you don’t like some of your introductory classes for your major, you can still love the major itself!!!!!#@p!#@Intro to Design (2.00) → Rank A!#@p!#@This class was the one that made me really excited about mechanical engineering! We had a building competition that was Avatar the Last Airbender themed, where we had to find a way to knock down 15-foot-tall “firebenders” (aka helium-inflated balloons) with only a few specific materials. My team ended up building a 17-foot-tall structure (named Appa) out of foam core, and we won the competition! Woohooo!!#@p!#@Numerical Computation for Mechanical Engineers (2.086) → Rank B!#@p!#@MATLAB and numerical analysis class. They don’t really teach you to code in this class, so I would definitely come in with some type of coding experience (even if it’s not MATLAB—shout out 6.100L!!!). Doing these PSETs were soooo satisfying.!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: This is the semester that I realized “ok, phew, I like Course 2!”!#@p!#@Thermofluids Engineering I (2.005) → Rank S!#@p!#@I LOVED THIS CLASS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES EVER. (also the only class I’ve ever had to PNR lol… the grading was pretty strict) Learning how the world works—and that there is a logical reason for most things—is mind blowing. Air conditioners. Refrigerators. Engines. Body heat.!#@p!#@21G.504 (Japanese 4) → Rank B!#@p!#@I tested into Japanese 4, and I made Japanese my humanities concentration. I highly recommend taking language classes at MIT—while they’re definitely a good amount of work, imagine being fluent in another language after only four semesters?!?! Why not?? Learn that language you’ve always been interested in!!#@p!#@Design and Manufacturing I (2.007) → Rank S!#@p!#@Such a fulfilling class. Over the course of a semester, you build your very own robot and then compete against your classmates. The two weeks before the competition, I probably spent 40 hours per week in Pappalardo, but get this: I wanted to be there and it was FUN. I went from not knowing how to properly handle a drill or lathe to winning the MacGyver Prize for creativity in that class! Woohoo!!#@p!#@Electronics for Mechanical Systems I (2.678) → Rank B!#@p!#@An intro, super high-level electronics class. At the end of the class, I got to program a line following robot with my roommate. Our robot was really fast (especially when it would nearly drive off the competition board!).!#@p!#@Comments about the semester: I felt my confidence as an engineer growing, and I was instilled with enough confidence to feel like I could contribute to my engineering internship in Tokyo.!#@p!#@Dynamics and Controls I (2.003) → Rank D!#@p!#@This was a tough semester for me, especially because I broke my foot and couldn’t play soccer all season. I didn’t put much effort into this class, focusing more on my two other project classes.!#@p!#@Global Engineer (2.76) → Rank C!#@p!#@Built a prototype of a highway litter cleaner for a major vehicle manufacturing company. It was a cool project, but I didn’t have the engineering skills yet to contribute as much as I wanted to. It inspired me to want to learn how to CAD more proficiently, which led me to doing a product design internship the next summer.!#@p!#@Science Writing and New Media (21W.035) → Rank B!#@p!#@This was a specific type of class called a CI-H, which usually only freshmen and sophomores take (but I hadn’t taken enough CI-H classes, and I was getting angry emails from MIT about it oopsie). I ended up in a class of all freshmen, and every class was so lively and borderline rambunctious that I couldn’t help but enjoy it.!#@p!#@D-Lab: Design for Scale (2.279) → Rank C!#@p!#@D-Lab! Built a prototype of a portable asthma diagnosis device for use in rural India. It was empowering to build a product with the sole purpose of helping others.!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: This semester was definitely my lowest in terms of tier-ranked classes. I bet there’s some association with the fact that I was sad about not being able to play soccer because of my injury. I enjoyed the classes, but I don’t look back on them with the same fondness as others.!#@p!#@Dynamics and Controls II (2.004) → Rank A!#@p!#@Because I kind of slacked off in 2.003 the previous semester, I was eager to dive back into learning. I really poured my heart into this class—which made it one of my favorite classes! Funny how effort and enjoyment seem to correlate…!#@p!#@Measurement & Instrumentation (2.671) → Rank A!#@p!#@This one might be a hot take, but I really liked this class. I wrote a blog about it here!!#@p!#@Design and Manufacturing II (2.008) → Rank D!#@p!#@With a team of five, we designed and manufactured 50 Snapple-themed yo-yos. We learned Fusion360, manufacturing simulations, CNC, injection molding, thermoforming, insert molding. I just realized I’m not the biggest fan of manufacturing.!#@p!#@Drawing for Designers (21M.601) → Rank D!#@p!#@This class was a three-hour drawing session on Wednesday nights. I took this class to learn how to draw better for my product design internship that summer. I swear everyone in that class was literally Leonardo DaVinci… besides me. But that’s ok! At the very least, I definitely improved!!!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: I was collecting more and more engineering skills (drawing, CAD, manufacturing). I was excited to put them all together at my product design internship.!#@p!#@Product Design Process (2.009) → Rank S!#@p!#@S tier. For sure. My team was awesome—driven to make a product that helped people and just fun to be around. I wrote a blog about this super cool experience.!#@p!#@Intro Bio (7.014) → Rank C!#@p!#@Bio is the final GIR that I had to take, which I’d been putting off since freshman year. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the approach of the teaching staff, who wanted us to learn something useful from the class even if we weren’t planning on becoming biologists. It was also nice to learn something technical yet completely unrelated to mechanical engineering for the first time in a while.!#@p!#@Japanese 5 (21G.505) → Rank A!#@p!#@Unlike Japanese 4, which focused more on grammar, this class focused on culture and conversation. It was refreshing to get to speak freely, especially about cultural things I related to (like food and specific Japanese mannerisms). I wrote this blog about how I romanticized this class.!#@p!#@Intro/Advanced Satellite Engineering (16.851/16.853) → Rank S!#@p!#@Alright, people, LISTEN UP! If you are interested in aerospace at all, but are not majoring in it, TAKE THIS CLASS! It gives you a crash course in so many topics: the rocket equations, power, communication, data-handling, the space environment, orbital mechanics, etc. Also, it’s taught by two incredibly engaging Course 16 professors: Prof. Kerri Cahoy and Prof. Oli de Weck.!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: I loved this semester. My classes were interesting and diverse, and every day there was something new to gush about to anyone who would listen.!#@p!#@Introduction to Numerical Analysis (16.S090) → Rank B!#@p!#@I took this class because I’ve been interested in data analysis for a while, and I missed coding. It ended up being pretty similar to 2.086, but I liked chatting with the professor during office hours, and I used Jupyter Notebook for the first time which was so satisfying. Also, this was a half semester class!!#@p!#@Entrepreneurship 101 (15.390) → Rank B!#@p!#@My very first Sloan business class. It’s been inspiring to realize that you can make your own job. I also appreciate how this class has a disciplined way of approaching entrepreneurship—I knew before that great ideas aren’t simply pulled from thin air, but this class is teaching me strategies on how to actually pin down that great idea and grow it.!#@p!#@Writing Fantasy (21W.766) → Rank A!#@p!#@I. Love. This. Class. It focuses on long-form fantasy: aka writing fantasy novels. We get to write drafts of chapters for our own books, and I’ve loved reading what all my classmates have come up with. This class has inspired me to write the fantasy novel that’s been marinating in my imagination for a while now…!#@p!#@Electronics for Mechanical Systems II (2.679) → Rank A!#@p!#@For the first time, I get to work with circuit boards! I’m making a Tamagotchi for my final product and the process of designing my own circuit board has taught me so much. I now feel like I can make so many little projects! I love collecting new technical skills!!#@p!#@Comments on this semester: Well, there’s three weeks left in this semester, so it’s not quite over yet. I’m excited to keep working on my Tamagotchi project, and I’ve loved how much I’ve gotten to write over these past few weeks!!#@p!#@Total classes taken: 46⁠02!#@p!#@Total number of units: 425 units!#@p!#@Different majors I’ve taken classes in: 10!#@p!#@Hardest semester: sophomore fall!#@p!#@Easiest semester: this semester, senior spring!!#@p!#@Most enjoyed semester: senior fall (because of S tier classes + soccer!!)!#@p!#@Most useful class: Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python (6.100L)!#@p!#@Most fun socially: Product Design Process (2.009)!#@p!#@Most proud: Design and Manufacturing I (2.007)!#@p!#@Worst grade: Thermofluids Engineering I (2.005)!#@p!#@All-nighters pulled: 0 (huge flex)!#@p!#@Most underrated class: any language class!#@p!#@Most engaging lectures: Intro Satellite Engineering (16.851)!#@p!#@Number of project classes (where I built something physical): 7⁠03!#@p!#@#1 favorite class at MIT: Design and Manufacturing I (2.007)!!!!#@p!#@It’s kind of crazy that I can summarize my four years of MIT classes into a single blog now. To make this blog, I went on Hydrant, which is a planning site for MIT classes so you can play around with your schedule. As I scrolled, I realized that I hadn’t been on this site for a while—probably because I won’t ever need to use it again.!#@p!#@I’m done choosing MIT undergrad classes. This is it—there is no more “what are you taking next semester?” It’s a little bittersweet, as many things are when you’re a senior with a month left until graduation.!#@p!#@But also making this blog has felt awesome. I feel accomplished; I feel proud! I feel lucky and grateful that I got to take these classes, and I can see just how much I’ve grown since I was a freshman, staring wide-eyed at the course catalog and overwhelmed by all the possibilities. Undergrad is cool. These classes are cool! Learning is so cool!!!#@p!#@I’m glad MIT is where I got to take four years of classes, and I hope learning never stops as I step beyond this place :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/robot-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/briota-hero-2-800x518.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-26-at-16.41.44_c1d9b4b4-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/litter-800x681.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/generated_image-4-17-400x229.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/robot-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/briota-hero-2-800x518.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-26-at-16.41.44_c1d9b4b4-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/litter-800x681.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/every-class-ive-ever-taken/
[Guest Post] STARS@MIT: A Year in Review by Nicole Cooper,By Claire S. '25,by Nicole Cooper,"April 23, 2025","We’ve been busy at the STARS College Network at MIT! This past year marked our second year as part of the consortium, and we’ve received a lot of great questions about the partnership—questions like: “What is STARS?” “What does MIT do as part of it?” and “How can it help me?”!#@p!#@Well, the short answer is: we’ve been doing a lot! So we asked Claire, one of our STARS (Small-Town and Rural Student) Ambassadors, to give you a quick recap of everything we’ve been up to this past year.!#@p!#@Spoiler alert: it’s been a big year. Check it out!!#@p!#@STARS@MIT: A Year in Review

When I was applying to college, I sometimes felt like I didn’t have people to turn to for advice in my small town. That’s why I’m so excited to share what STARS@MIT and the STARS Ambassadors—current college students from small-town and rural areas—have been doing to support rural high schoolers exploring their college options. These ambassadors serve to complement MIT’s partnership with the STARS College Network, a network of 32 colleges across the U.S. with programs tailored specifically for small-town and rural students.

As a STARS Ambassador myself, I can confirm that we’ve been really busy over this last year, brainstorming ways we could give rural students the resources we wish we’d had when applying to college and deciding on the right fit for us. So as we wrap up our first full academic year of programming, here’s a year in review of what STARS Ambassadors at MIT have been up to—and what’s still ahead!

Webinars
STARS@MIT hosts several webinars, run by both admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors. So far, topics have included applying to college as a rural student and what to expect if you decide to go to college far from home or in a big city. The end of each session leaves time for participants to ask questions, so if you have any questions you want to ask live, this is your chance!

We also use these webinars to dispel some common misconceptions when it comes to top colleges. These include the concerns that a top college would be too expensive (not true—financial aid can be very generous!) or that if you didn’t win Math Olympiad, you’re not who these colleges are looking for (also not true—admissions officers consider your application within the context of your environment, and they’re looking for people from a range of backgrounds because they understand the value rural students bring).

Our next webinar is May 14, 2025 at 7pm EDT, where we’ll be talking about navigating the transition from a small town to a big city for college. You can find this event, along with all our upcoming offerings, at this link. We hope to see you there!

Fly-In Programs
This past year, we hosted two separate fly-in events—one for rural and small-town high school counselors and another for rural and small-town high school students.



MIT co-hosted STARS’ inaugural Northeast Counselor Conference along with Yale University, Brown University, Colby College, and Columbia University in the City of New York. During the program, counselors traveled between Yale, Brown and MIT (host universities) along with representatives from those universities with support from Columbia University and Colby College. Counselors went on campus tours, interacted with student ambassadors during Q&A panels, and participated in case studies with admissions officers to learn more about the college admission process and how they can support their students back home. The program aimed to show counselors the environment each university provides and what these universities look for in applications, so the counselors could then return to their respective rural and small-town high schools and more effectively guide students toward the right universities for them.

In addition to the counselor fly-in, STARS@MIT also hosted a fly-in program for rural and small-town high school juniors. Unlike the counselor fly-in, however, the student fly-in was hosted solely by MIT (although several colleges who participate in STARS host their own version of this student fly-in). Visiting students stayed in the dorms with current students and experienced three days packed with activities. I won’t go too in-depth about the student fly-in because Vaneeza R. ’25, another STARS Ambassador, has already written a great blog post about it. You can read all about it here.  And if you’re from a small town and going to be a high school junior for the 2025-2026 school year, watch our events page (linked at the bottom of this post) for when the fly-in application opens in June.

Virtual College Fair
Every semester, all of STARS’ partner colleges get together to host a virtual college fair for rural and small-town students. This is a space for students to learn more about these colleges, plus get any questions they have answered. While you’re always welcome to reach out to colleges individually, this is a unique opportunity because it brings 32 colleges across the country together in one place.

But what exactly should you be doing at a college fair? Good question—I never had a college fair in my town, either. The only things I knew about them came from movies or TV shows. But unlike what I saw on the screen, college fairs are not meant to be stressful. They’re meant for learning. You’re not being judged by the admissions officers based on how well you pitch yourself (you don’t need to be pitching yourself at all!!). This is your time to learn about colleges, and the admissions officers are the ones pitching their colleges to you!

If you want to take full advantage of a STARS virtual college fair, look into the universities beforehand and come into the event with an idea of the institutions you are excited about and what qualities matter to you in a college, then figure out which colleges you’re interested in have those qualities. But if you’re not at the stage where you know what colleges you’re interested in or what matters to you in a college, that’s also okay. This time is also for exploring places you may not have otherwise considered. Use the college fair to help answer those questions, or see if the admissions officers can direct you to more resources to help you figure that out. Wherever you are in the college application process, from having no idea where to start to knowing exactly where you want to apply, STARS virtual college fairs are open to you.

This upcoming college fair, MIT will have both admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors (current students) available to answer any questions you might have.

Outreach Trips
While not something STARS Ambassadors participate in (unfortunately we do have classes to go to), admissions officers at MIT often join other colleges in the STARS Network to travel across the country and meet students in rural areas! This is through the STORY (Small-Town Outreach Recruitment and Yield) program and STARS outreach travel. Want to see if STARS is visiting a town near you? Hop on the STARS College Network events page to see what visits are coming up next! Here’s a really cool blog post from our STARS program coordinator and MIT’s Assistant Director of Admissions for Rural Outreach, Nikki, about one of the STORY trips she took.

Welcoming Admitted Students
All of the programming mentioned so far has been directed toward rural students applying to college, but what about students who have actually been admitted to college? Our STARS Ambassadors are also hard at work to make sure these admits feel welcome. This support starts from the moment students find out they’ve been admitted to MIT all the way to the day they commit to a college. This academic year, we wrote individual postcards to admitted rural and small-town students, hosted a virtual celebration for them (and one for their parents!), and even ran an in-person event during Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) where STARS adMITS could connect with new and current students from similar backgrounds. The transition to a new environment can be difficult, especially if you don’t feel like it’s an experience shared by your peers, so our goal is to provide a community for rural and small-town students at MIT to feel like they’re heard and understood.

STARS@MIT Email Inbox
Do you have questions that aren’t answered in our programming? Or maybe you just want to have a conversation with someone who’s been through similar experiences to you? We run an email address, starsprogram@mit.edu, that we encourage you to reach out to with STARS-related questions. This includes admissions, experiences as a rural student at MIT, and even general advice. We have admissions officers and STARS Ambassadors waiting to answer your emails!


Final Thoughts
“Now Claire, this all sounds great, but how do I know if I qualify as a rural or small town student?”

This is actually a question that comes up a lot. One misconception is that STARS defines “rural and small-town” based solely on National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data. But this isn’t necessarily true—each college actually makes their own decisions on who they consider rural and small-town based on many factors from population to your lived experience.  The reason for these differences is because we recognize what makes an area rural or small, is so complex. There is no map that can quantify the feeling of the environment you grew up in or the resources your school was able to provide. So as long as you identify as coming from a rural or small-town, most of our STARS programming is open to you! If you’re interested in a specific college, reach out to them directly and see if you fall under their definition of rural and small-town.

Finally, while our STARS Ambassadors technically work for MIT, we’re not here to recruit as many rural students to MIT as possible—we’re here to help you find the right college for you. We recognize everyone has a different path, and we want to help you find that path and support you along your journey. To that end, we’re excited about the programs we were able to support this past year—but we’re also equally excited to see what the next academic year holds.

To stay up-to-date on our programming, keep an eye on this page where we’ll be posting all our events. Our programs are continually evolving and expanding to be the best they can be, so we want to hear your thoughts on how we can best support you as a rural student looking into college. Please don’t hesitate to send an email to our inbox—we’d love to talk to you.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-starsmit-a-year-in-review/
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!! by Aiden H. '28,and also my major and also indecision,by Aiden H. '28,"April 20, 2025","This coming Tuesday, the major declaration form is due for freshmen.!#@p!#@What follows is the very long and detailed crisis I had in picking my major, organized by what I considered, in a roughly chronological order:!#@p!#@Course 8 (Physics)!#@p!#@Okay I never seriously considered physics while at MIT, but in sophomore/junior/early senior year of high school, I told everyone that I was going to major in (astro)physics, which I don’t necessarily regret? I think I had a lot of fair reasoning behind thinking I wanted to major in physics–I’ve always loved math, and space has been my weird nerd thing since I was young and declared Neptune the greatest planet as I put the sticky stars on my ceiling.!#@p!#@Then I took AP Physics C: Mechanics and quickly realized that I do not like physics at all.⁠01 It was actively the worst I have ever felt about myself academically, and I learned that the learning curve and extensive background knowledge to go from general physics to anything astronomy-applied is far to great for me to care.!#@p!#@Nonetheless, I did apply to some schools as a physics major. Funnily enough, I didn’t apply to MIT as physics, and it was one of the “prestigious” schools that accepted me. It’s as if even the others knew that physics wasn’t for me lol.!#@p!#@Course 20 (Bioengineering)!#@p!#@Bioengineering was the other main track I shifted to after the physics-debacle. This also made a fair amount of sense and isn’t that random. I took AP Bio senior year and really liked it, and in middle school Bio was always my favorite/most-interested-in topic. Half of it was all the cute little cell drawings and fun words like “golgi apparatus”, but I think the upfront helping-others mission in all bio-adjacent fields has always resonated with me and something I could see myself doing that is at least a little noble and important.!#@p!#@I wasn’t super sold on the engineering part though. I’ve always seen myself as someone who is more interested in learning about things than making them, so engineering seemed like a long shot. I had no interest in medical technology in the same way that I have no interest in electronics or mechanical engineering–fields that feel very structurally similar to bioengineering. But knowing very well I wasn’t going to go pre-med or do a PhD, bioengineering felt more useful as a bachelors than pure bio.!#@p!#@Course 6-7 (Computer Science and Molecular Biology)!#@p!#@I remember sitting at a debate tournament in Colorado looking through all the MIT majors out of curiosity, when I stumbled upon the strange beauty that is 6-7. I instantly called people I knew to tell them I knew what I wanted to do. I felt like it would allow me to doing something in biology that isn’t dissecting mice or using X-rays or whatever.⁠02 And like that I thought I was fine!! Like I decided once and for all what I would do!!#@p!#@It is strongly appealing because it doesn’t have that I-will-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-rotting-under-the-fluorescent-lighting-of-a-lab feeling, but going most of my freshman year thinking about declaring 6-7, I was hit with an equally devastating feeling: I-will-spend-the-rest-of-my-life-straining-my-eyes-and-hunching-my-back-over-my-computer. I still heavily considered 6-7, but with more and more time to ruminate over the class list, I noticed I like the sound of the major a lot more than the work itself. I like the idea of using stats for biology more than I do actually sitting doing and coding the programs themselves. I like the sound of taking classes like “Intro to Algorithms” or “Machine Learning in Molecular and Cellular Biology” much more than I do actually doing any of those psets for hours on end with no gratification.!#@p!#@The crisis continues.!#@p!#@Course 18 (Math)!#@p!#@Sorry! I like math! Sue me!!#@p!#@I was taking 18.02 and noticed that the beginnings of college math felt a lot like high school math–take a subject with a name, learn a bunch of new operations and ways to do math, and then take tests on those routine operations and problem solving skills. Then I find out that a math major is proofs and I immediately lost interest. I don’t want to learn LaTeX, or why numbers exist, or how to connect those dots from Good Will Hunting. I like doing integrals though–so something with a little math or at least math class requirements is important.!#@p!#@Course 17 (Political Science)!#@p!#@This has been the crisis of a lifetime. I’ve talked about this before, but I was very very very intensely not a “STEM kid” growing up. I heard “you should be a lawyer” 10000000x more than “you should be a doctor” or whatever the equivalent is. Most of my friends ended up in poli-sci. I kept this attitude with me throughout high school, with essentially everything on my application and resume pointing towards a traditional humanities path in something like public policy/political science/international relations. And the issue is I am very interested in all of these things! But a part of me knows that I do not enjoy poli-sci classes as much as STEM or an alternative arts/humanity. I also know that I do not want to go to law school.!#@p!#@After a lot of deliberation,⁠03 I realized that I don’t want a job that comes out of a poli-sci degree, but instead anything I would want to do in the public sector would be related to public health policy or researching the effects on international relations on other issues (like health, education, science, etc.). All of these jobs can come with a background in a technical field, basic statistics/CS, or just any degree and a passion for it.!#@p!#@Part of me still feels weird not being a poli-sci major, but if I chose wrong I can just get a masters.!#@p!#@(and getting into politics with a stem degree is easier than ever, so potentially Hurst 2048🦅)!#@p!#@Course 11-6 (Urban Science and Planning with Computer Science)!#@p!#@This came post- the course 17 realization™ when I wanted to look at ways to use STEM for a more traditionally government/public job.!#@p!#@Then I remembered I don’t like coding enough and that’s where this major crisis came from in the first place.!#@p!#@Course 6-14 (Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science)!#@p!#@I found out that Jane Street quants can make $300,000 as a starting salary and I had a lapse in judgement that put me into a very capitalist mindset for like 3 hours, and then I remembered I don’t like coding that much and I don’t think the economy is real and I don’t want to work on Wall Street and I hate everything about business culture.!#@p!#@(but I’d still take the salary)!#@p!#@Course 21T (Theater)!#@p!#@Do I become attached to very intense pipe dreams very fast? Yes. Was one of those that I could drop out and become a famous actor? Also yes.!#@p!#@Then I started taking 21T.101,⁠04 am having a bad time, and realized that if I were to become an actor, a major in theater-adjacent classes from a tech school probably won’t change that trajectory too much.!#@p!#@Course 1 (Civil and Environmental Engineering)!#@p!#@This lasted about an hour, but every now and again I feel the crushing guilt of climate change weigh on my soul and I feel guilty that I’m not using the resources I have to become a part of the solution.!#@p!#@I would hate it a lot though–next!!#@p!#@Course 5-7 (Chemistry and Biology)!#@p!#@Not a shocking choice, but like I said before, I’m not super sold on pure sciences because I’m not all that interested in research/academia as a career path. Realistically, it wouldn’t matter that much, and this along with any bio-related major would be enough to put me in biotech. I think the lack of math/applied technology is the main drawback for me, but the pure chemistry classes (like “inorganic chemistry” as opposed to the chemistry classes of ChemE like “fluid mechanics”) are interesting to me.!#@p!#@As of now, I keep 5-7 as my backup in case I have a crisis because a lot of the classes I’ll have to take anyway, and it’s close enough to what I want to do that it won’t be an issue.!#@p!#@Course 21L (Literature)!#@p!#@I’ve felt a very strong pull to commit myself to more than the bare minimum HASS⁠05 requirement. With poli-sci and theater out of the running, though, I’ve returned to the idea of literature.!#@p!#@I said a lot in high school that I wanted to double major in STEM and non-STEM because I didn’t want to neglect one or the other. My answer to this was always literature. I loved reading and writing as a kid, and literature classes were largely my favorite in high school.!#@p!#@I haven’t declared 21L yet, though, because part of it feels “useless”? Which is a common dilemma at a strongly tech school like MIT–everyone likes and takes HASS classes, but I feel like those can only be side quests. If I’m going to be a scientist, why stress myself out with the major requirements when I can just take a couple literature classes and call it good? I don’t know if I’ll declare the major, or a minor, or a concentration, but nonetheless I want to take a lot of lit classes while I’m here.!#@p!#@Course 10B (Chemical-Biological Engineering)!#@p!#@As I continued to grow weary of the amount of CS coursework with 6-7, I started thinking about other majors that could still put me in biotech. I have a couple friends who are planning on 10B, and the lab my UROP is in is a ChemE lab, so I had a lot of people to bounce questions off of (and also encourage me into switch to 10B).!#@p!#@The bio track is exactly the same as the other bio majors (20, 6-7, and 7), so even though it’s technically ChemE, I’m not changing the amount of biology I would be taking. I also would much rather take more chemistry-esque classes than learn about the “Mathematics of Computer Science” or “Algorithms”.!#@p!#@I also feel like the major is a lot less restrictive than the box I put myself in with 6-7. I am still interested in bioinformatics/comp bio, but I could easily go down that path with a biochemical background (like my UROP mentor and everyone in the lab I’m working in). However, if I back out and decide I want to do lab work or some other industry project, I’m not stuck to the computational side.!#@p!#@As of now, this is the major. 🎉!#@p!#@Maybe Course 7 (Biology)?!#@p!#@At this point not shocking. I still wouldn’t do only biology, but I noticed that all of the classes needed for course 7 are already covered by 10B except for one. If I get bored and take the extra course 7 class, I might declare the double just to have it (assuming I don’t major in anything else, which is statistically⁠06 unlikely).!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@If that felt like a lot–it was! It’s the weight bearing down on most of the freshman class right now.!#@p!#@I feel like a lot of people, both close to me and not, have a perception that because I go to a prestigious school and have always done well in school that everything should naturally fall into place–that I should feel confident that I’m meant to be here. I sometimes feel guilty that I don’t. Not in an imposter syndrome, I-don’t-deserve-to-go-here way, but in an I’m-still-very-lost-like-every-other-college-student way. I wasn’t born with the same intrinsic passion that a lot of my peers have. I haven’t known since I was three that I really wanted to be an engineer and that this was my life’s greatest dream come true. A lot of the time I still feel like a student who just went to college because that’s what most people do, and what else am I gonna do?!#@p!#@This is why picking a major has been so hard and fueled by indecision–I’ve had to realize⁠07 that I am not foaming at the mouth at the idea of having a job, that if you told me I won the lottery or became famous overnight, I probably wouldn’t continue this career path because “I love it so much” and “it’s my life’s purpose”. I just have to pick something I like enough to be a person with a job–which is normal, just not necessarily at MIT.!#@p!#@I need to find a way to separate whatever passions I can find and whatever professional stuff I have going on. This feels like an impossible task for me though. I’ve always taken everything to such an extreme that I end up hating it because it just becomes work. I can’t just be in a play, I have to be a theater major who goes on to be a famous actor. I can’t simply like to play piano, I have to drop out and go to Juilliard and become a Grammy winner. I convince myself things don’t matter if I don’t give my everything to them. What’s the point if it could be better? What can simply be dad lore and what is my actual career path? Does it intrinsically make something worse if it isn’t my career and just a hobby? Who knows! I probably won’t find the answer in my chemistry classes though, and that’s fine.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@tl;dr i thought a lot about a lot of majors!#@p!#@p.s. don’t even ask how many different minors I’ve said I’m gonna get.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-declare-bankruptcy/

The Cost of Living at MIT by Aiden H. '28,"alternatively, how to spend money at MIT",by Aiden H. '28,"April 14, 2025","A couple months ago, I wrote about how to make money at MIT. Much to our collective dismay, there is another side of the coin: spending money. For most students, college will be their first experience largely handling their own finances in a day-to-day sense. As someone who notably does not have an Elon Musk-sized inheritance from my parents and who has to take care of pretty much all of their expenditures, choosing to live in a very expensive city was difficult.  Boston is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the US (see: Example A, Example B, Example C from a quick Google search). However, with enough adjusting to prices and scrounging for the best deals, I’ve found a way to make living work without having to eat instant ramen every day in the stereotypical broke-college-student way.!#@p!#@Curious to find how others think of Boston living prices, I sent out a poll on Dormspam⁠01 asking students how much they spend monthly to see the cost of MIT outside of tuition. Out of 4535 undergraduates, I got responses from 72 (more than I expected! but still kinda sad). I asked for the average estimated cost of both essentials (toiletries, clothes, dorm stuff, etc.)–split by those who are and aren’t on meal plans–and non-essentials (“unnecessary” food/treats, going out money, concert tickets, general Boston stuff, etc.).!#@p!#@The summary stats⁠02 are as follows:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-3.40.31 PM.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-3.43.17 PM.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-13-at-3.54.04 PM.png]!#@Overall:!#@p!#@Here are some key takeaways that I think people should consider.!#@p!#@Meal Plan vs. Cook-For-Yourself!#@p!#@Food is by far the most expensive, and variable, part of people’s budgets. Although students on meal plans/in dining hall dorms⁠03 are spending about $250 less per month, they pay upfront for dining when they pay tuition. The two meal plans offered for freshman (and also the most common) both cost $3824.25/semester. This means that a meal plan adds $957/month, but most students will factor this into tuition costs and financial aid instead of their day-to-day budgeting.!#@p!#@Because of this cost, a lot of students opt to live in a cook-for-yourself dorm that allow students to be completely in charge of their own food. While these can lead to less financial stress, it does require students to manage their time to grocery shop and cook, or pay for take-out meals consistently, which can potentially be just as expensive, have smaller portions compared to buffet-style dining, and possibly less nutritious.!#@p!#@Notably, students on financial aid can have their meal plan covered depending on their aid. I’m not an expert on the aid process and everything should be confirmed with SFS,⁠04 but I know that students on full financial aid like myself do have the cost of a meal plan fully covered regardless of dorm type.!#@p!#@Thoughts from anonymous poll-answerers:!#@p!#@Fun Stuff!#@p!#@Boston is a major-ish city! This means that doing things cost adult-living-in-a-major-city prices. On one hand, I want to go full-crazy I’m-totally-living-in-like-Friends-or-Sex-and-the-City and go to like a concert⁠05 or nightclub⁠06 every night. Still, I’ve personally found myself a lot less inclined to go out and get a quick coffee/see a movie/go to a concert because the cost is so inflated compared to the Midwest.!#@p!#@Fortunately, this is the most controllable expense, and utilizing campus-run events and services also makes this easier. LSC⁠07 runs movie screenings in 26-100,⁠08 dorm and frat parties are generally every Friday and Saturday, and a couple times a semester the school will just host things for students (recently, a trip to the aquarium, museum of science, and the Maseeh Boat Cruise come to mind).!#@p!#@Thoughts from anonymous poll-answerers:!#@p!#@It’s Not That Bad!#@p!#@Finances are scary, and spending money makes me feel guilty no matter how little or big the purchase. Still, if you’re able to work even a part-time summer job and then find a way to work a couple hours a week on campus, that should be enough money to make it through a semester, as long as you’re smart with the money you earned. Also, students who demonstrate the most financial aid often get returns each semester, which is extra financial aid money sent directly to you to cover things like dorm essentials/flights/anything you might need during the semester. Depending on the student, this can be up to an additional $3000 to ease the pain of college prices.!#@p!#@More thoughts:!#@p!#@Happy spending 🤑🤑!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-3.40.31 PM.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-3.43.17 PM.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-13-at-3.54.04 PM.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-cost-of-living-at-mit/
Lax bros by Emiko P. '25,and their workflows,by Emiko P. '25,"April 14, 2025","The start of spring is an important time — not because summer is drawing near, not because the temperature is heating up, and not even because the sun stays out past 6 pm. No, the start of spring means one thing and one thing only: it’s lax season!!!#@p!#@The women’s and men’s lacrosse games are staples of an MIT student-athlete’s spring. Those games are a great chance to get outside and watch some fire athleticism on Roberts and Jack Barry Field.!#@p!#@I got the chance to catch up with Sydney P. ‘25 and Isaiah N. ‘26, and they told me a little bit about life as an MIT lax bro.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-14-at-12.40.21_c081cf93-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-14-at-12.40.21_7bfe9c21-800x533.jpg]!#@Sydney: Hi! My name is Sydney and I’m a senior studying Chemical-Biological Engineering (10B) and Finance (15-3). I’m originally from outside of Philadelphia, PA. Outside of lacrosse, I’m also a member of Greek life, a senior chair on the ChemE Undergrad Student Advisory Board, and a campus tour guide.!#@p!#@Isaiah: I’m a current third year studying electrical engineering and computer science. Outside of lacrosse, I am an undergraduate researcher at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, I work as a learning assistant for Computation Structures, and I’m an active member of a fraternity on campus.!#@p!#@Sydney: I started playing lacrosse when I was in fifth grade and have been playing ever since. I didn’t always know I wanted to play in college, but when the recruiting process began, I quickly fell in love with the idea of playing and studying at MIT. It has been such an amazing experience — the mitlwax community is truly unlike any other I have been a part of.!#@p!#@Isaiah: I’ve been playing lacrosse for 11 years now, starting when I was 10 years old. For almost all of those years, I’ve played on the defensive side of the field as a long stick defender. Specifically at MIT, lacrosse has played a central part in my experience here. It gave me the opportunity to continue playing the sport I love and I’ve even met some of my closest friends from the team. Overall, lacrosse provides a great outlet away from academics and work.!#@p!#@Sydney: Our season has been really fun so far! We graduated a lot of amazing seniors last year, so this has been a year of rebuilding our program. We have grown so much as a unit over the past couple of months, and it’s been truly so fun to watch all of the pieces come together in our games. We are currently 6-1 in conference play and getting ready to begin the NEWMAC tournament.!#@p!#@Isaiah: The season has been going well so far. We’ve had lots of close games this year and have been playing some solid competition. I think we should be getting a good seed for NEWMACs at the end of the year.!#@p!#@Sydney: I’m excited to compete in playoffs and — fingers crossed — finish off our season with a NEWMAC Championship ;)!#@p!#@Isaiah: The main thing I’m looking forward to for the remainder of the season is playing the rest of the teams in the NEWMAC. Conference games are always the most intense and competitive. We even have some school rivalries going, so these types of games are always a lot of fun to play in.!#@p!#@Sydney: For the past two Spring Breaks, our team has been stuck on campus with conference games. So to make our own fun, we rented out an airbnb in Maine to spend a weekend together. I have made some of my best memories during my time at MIT during these trips — so many laughs, coffee walks, hikes, and just getting to spend time together.!#@p!#@Isaiah: My best lacrosse memory from MIT was winning the semifinal game in the NEWMAC tournament against Springfield. Springfield is definitely one of our rivals so there was a lot of build up before the game. The game was super close but we came out on top.!#@p!#@Sydney: A Wednesday game day typically begins for me with waking up at 9 AM and enjoying my breakfast before crossing the Charles River from my house in Boston to campus for my first class of the day. At 10 AM, I have 10.490 Integrated Chemical Engineering. After class, I’ll head over to my fellow seniors Jules and Syd’s apartment to enjoy lunch together. Then, Julianne and I will head to our next class of the day at 1 PM at Sloan, 15.465 which is Alphanomics: Behavioral Finance. After class, we usually go to the Stud (Student Center) and print out our game day posters and buy snacks for our psych buddies before heading over to the locker room. Then the fun begins! The locker room before games is always so chaotic — filled with dancing, hair braiding, Celsius-drinking, and pre-game cheers. We’ll then play our game (and win!!) and spend the rest of the night having dinner and finishing up school work for the day.!#@p!#@Isaiah: On a typical day, I wake up at 9:00 AM to get ready for the day. Before heading to host 10:00 AM office hours for Computation Structures, I make sure to grab a quick snack. By 11:00 AM, I head to lecture for Design and Analysis of Algorithms. After lecture I head to lunch, which is almost always Chipotle or Cava. I then have about a 3 hour break where I usually work on my research or some problem sets. From 5-7 PM, I go to lacrosse practice and then eat dinner at my fraternity. For the rest of the night, I mostly do homework.!#@p!#@Sydney: I love how close our team is. We all genuinely care about each other so much, and I can say with confidence that spending every day together from 5-7 (or sometimes even longer) is always the highlight of all of our days. I can always count on mitwlax for someone to study with, get hype with, crash out with (after a tough loss), or celebrate with.!#@p!#@Isaiah: My favorite thing about the lacrosse team is the team culture. Everyone works hard around the clock both on and off the field, whether it be academics or athletics. Anytime you may need something, there’s always someone willing to help you out. Beyond that, the guys on the team always make sure to leave time to hang out with one another and have fun.!#@p!#@Good luck with the rest of your season, wlax and mlax!

the best thing i did for myself as a pre-frosh by Veronica P. '27,the one where i gush about burton one,by Veronica P. '27,"April 7, 2025","The cherry blossoms are out and the students are slipping onto Kresge Lawn again, accompanied by instruments to strum and bubble teas to sip and soaking in the Boston sun on one of those early spring days where the warmth still feels like a tiny miracle. Campus is starting to resemble the campus I fell in love with, the one I encountered in this same state as a pre-frosh at Campus Preview Weekend.!#@p!#@I was one of those admits for whom CPW felt like a whirlwind of an experience, 3.14 days that whizzed by like a door violently swinging open on its hinges, revealing to me all the possible ways my life was capable of stretching and splitting and changing. Looking back, however, it was one of the most unassuming moments of the weekend that stuck with me the most.!#@p!#@I was alone and visiting this dorm, Burton Conner, for a free Thai food event. I loaded my plate, turned around, and was briefly catapulted into the classically mortifying high-school-cafeteria-where-on-earth-do-I-sit dilemma. Luckily, college orientations are funny in that they’re a lot like kindergarten, in that “everyone is a potential friend and everything is a friend-making opportunity” kind of way. So, I pushed down my fear and approached the table of people who, smiling and sporting thrifted clothing, struck me as friendly and cool (in the completely subjective, instinctive definition of the latter that everyone holds in their brain).!#@p!#@They immediately welcomed me, and if they weren’t so sweet I would have been way more embarrassed by the fact that not a single one of them was a pre-frosh. In a way, it was relieving— none of that pressure to ‘forge new bonds’ and make small talk. All of them clearly seemed to be good friends, so I was content to just sit back and watch the conversation bounce across the table. I laughed a few times, caught a couple of their names, and shyly excused myself once I had finished eating.!#@p!#@I didn’t think much of the half hour until a few weeks later, when it came time to rank my dorm preferences on the housing portal. I think something about that table’s close-knit, joyful energy had stuck with me. It was as if they served as living proof that it was possible to find your people at MIT. On a gut instinct, I ranked Burton Conner first, and eventually came to learn that the people I had met were part of the floor Burton One. They held a distinct passion for the color b1ue and referred to themselves as “the Boners⁠01 .” Maybe the title should have given me pause, but honestly I didn’t even give it a second thought.  There were so many nuances about the community that mattered way more than that.!#@p!#@Flash forward about two years, and I’m one of our floor chairs. Not necessarily by choice— the election process did involve moderate amounts of chasing down the hallway and may have ended with me being dragged into our lounge with various seniors hoisting my limbs as I protested “NO NO NOOOOO”. 02 But that drama aside,  it still seems like every day I find a new reason to feel grateful for my split second decision to approach that table.!#@p!#@I feel it when I’m hiding in a dorm room with twenty people, all crowded around a blueberry cake and trying to stifle our laughter when we realize that the birthday girl we were trying to surprise at midnight has just turned on the shower next door.!#@p!#@I feel it when I’m counting down the ‘new year’ in the middle of March, because somehow we’ve all managed to fumble our resolutions so early into the year and could really use a second chance.!#@p!#@I feel it when we’re in our Associate Head of House’s hallway, lining the walls with tape art of her son’s favorite cartoon characters. People are making fun of me because I care way too much about getting the perfect perspective on my lego block.!#@p!#@I feel it when I’m trying to find a place to study between classes and I get a text announcing that it’s ‘romping’ weather. I know that if I walk past the student center I’ll find a group of us working on a picnic blanket, taking full advantage of the heat.!#@p!#@I feel it when I walk past the 32 kitchen and hear a makeshift band performing indie renditions while the not-so-musically-inclined prepare spring rolls.!#@p!#@Or when I come home to the 41 and see that the alignment chart is being updated, and 5 people are in a heated debate about whether one resident should be placed closer to “chiller” or “tweaker.” 03!#@p!#@Or when I get a text that there’s pad thai in the 52, and one of our DJ’s is mixing on the dining table while everyone grabs a bite.!#@p!#@Or afterwards, when we migrate to the 33 because their raspberry brownies have just come out of the oven, shamelessly interrupting their Survivor watch party.!#@p!#@I feel it when we’re the loudest group in the crowd, lifting a comically large cardboard cutout of a b1ner’s face and cheering their name.!#@p!#@I feel it when I spot figures in blue morph-suits prancing around the Infinite, wordlessly handing out fliers to confused passerby to promote our next event (we take our annual theme ‘everyth1ng 1s b1ue’ quite literally.)!#@p!#@I feel it when I’m on retreat in Maine, sprinting towards the lake with a giant bowl as two b1ners frantically scoop water out of their rapidly sinking boat, unable to catch my breath because we can’t stop laughing as they try to stay afloat.!#@p!#@I feel it when I’m on a boat in Mexico, lying in the sun with a junior who feels more like an older sister to me, reflecting on how much we’ve seen each other grow since the spring break prior. The waves pass gently beneath us and we talk about loving ourselves. The music crescendos from the other end of the boat and we talk about our desire to experience every emotion to the fullest, good or bad, because what else could be the point of living?  But who knows, maybe next spring break our answer will change again.!#@p!#@It’s hard to find a moment where I don’t feel it, to tell the truth. If there’s only one advice I could give to incoming college freshman, it’s to find people you can come home to. Maybe they don’t literally live on your same floor, maybe they share your values in different ways, but you need a network that can support you through what you’re going through— people you can consistently rely on to accept you and look out for your best interests, to help make your load feel lighter. As B1 likes to put it: more than friends, not quite family.!#@p!#@In my first ever meeting with my freshman advisor, he ended it on a question he asks all of his advisees: “Have you found your community here?”!#@p!#@And yes, I most certainly had.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2849-800x1207.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7491-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1112-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3421-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/17D78B0C-4EFC-4C3B-8A64-8A8E99AF5135-800x600.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2849-800x1207.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7491-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1112-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3421-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/17D78B0C-4EFC-4C3B-8A64-8A8E99AF5135-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/bone/
"Food, glorious food by Andi Q. '25","In which I learn that Simmons Dining is not, in fact, the best that Boston's food scene has to offer",by Andi Q. '25,"April 6, 2025","If you asked me before spring break where I like to eat around MIT, I would have told you Simmons Dining (or maybe Maseeh Dining more recently⁠01 ). Despite having been at MIT for almost four years, I had not yet explored Boston’s food scene as much as some people have in their first semester. Even my sister, who has only visited Boston for a few weeks, knows more places to eat out than I do!!#@p!#@So when Aiden posted his tier list of MIT’s dining halls and rated Simmons Dining a measly B, I knew what I had to do over spring break – go out and eat at some actual restaurants near MIT. Plus, Simmons Dining was closed during spring break anyway, so I couldn’t eat there even if I wanted to.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6B33C7F86A78-1-800x801.jpeg]!#@This was my first spring break meal, and we were already off to a rough start. (Although I guess spring break had not officially started…)!#@p!#@Maseeh was the only dining hall open that morning, and I was not mentally/physically prepared to venture off campus quite yet. I don’t remember what I got (it was probably scrambled eggs and a bagel or something), but it was just okay.!#@p!#@To compensate for my sad brunch, some friends and I went to Punto Rojo – a small Colombian restaurant near the Boston Logan Airport. Punto Rojo is quite far from MIT’s campus (we had to take two separate MBTA lines to get there, and it took like an hour), but it was definitely worth the trip. The food was delicious (and contained vegetables), the portions were huge, and it was (relatively) cheap.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@Still fueled by the adrenaline of venturing off MIT’s campus the previous day, I went to Veggie Galaxy for brunch. Veggie Galaxy is a traditional American diner on Mass Ave near MIT, with the twist that everything they serve is vegetarian. It looks extremely suspicious from the outside ( almost like a drug den⁠02 ), but it is actually very decent on the inside.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@It started drizzling in the afternoon, so I went to Jahunger – a Uyghur restaurant that makes hand-pulled noodles, right behind my dorm. It’s only about a block away from Simmons, but I didn’t know about it until this spring break. I wish I’d known about it sooner though, because Jahunger was one of the best restaurants on this list.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0471.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0472.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0473.png]!#@It was still raining in the morning, so I went to Cafe Luna – a popular brunch spot also not far from Simmons. I don’t have much to say about this place. It’s just regular brunch food, and they do it well. (Though admittedly, I was also not super adventurous in my order.)!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@By late afternoon, it was pouring outside. I didn’t want to walk in the rain or call an Uber, so I just prepared the pack of frozen Trader Joe’s Mandarin Orange Chicken I had sitting in my freezer since January. A rather sad college-student meal, but it still beats going to a dining hall.!#@p!#@Cicada is a Vietnamese fusion cafe near the H Mart on Mass Ave. I went there on Gloria ’26’s and Janet ’27’s suggestion, because they think “their black rice is sooo good”. Gloria and Janet have eaten out a lot, so I thought this endorsement meant that the black rice would be life-changing. But honestly, it wasn’t that great. Like it was still good, but I went in with such high expectations that I was sorely disappointed when I took the first bite and didn’t transcend to a higher flavor dimension.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@Yeah. At least the salad made it somewhat healthier this time, I guess.!#@p!#@At this point in the week, my body desperately needed vegetables, so I went to Brookline Lunch – a Mediterranean brunch restaurant on Mass Ave. It’s like Cafe Luna but better (Mediterranean food >>> American food). But it’s also somewhat worse because they only accept cash, which I did not know until I got the bill, and consequently had to spend an extra $10 on ATM fees.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@Coreanos is a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant in Allston. Cuisine aside, it’s similar to Punto Rojo in several ways: it’s small, relatively far from MIT (I walked about an hour to get there), and the food is good yet cheap (I think this meal also cost me ~$14). I went here on Jebby ’25’s suggestion.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@Saloniki is probably the restaurant I’ve eaten at the most in Boston. It’s a Greek “fast food” restaurant right next to MIT’s campus, and it’s just so convenient yet also tastes so good. It’s like McDonald’s but healthy and generally better in every way. They also give you fries for free if you show them your student ID. I love Saloniki so much – writing about it makes me want to eat there again after posting this blog post.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@I was in Boston helping two of my friends shop for their dance outfits, and we were all collectively craving Shake Shack. Just like Cafe Luna, there’s not much to say here – it’s Shake Shack, and it was exactly what you’d expect from it.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@I was running out of unique brunch places within walking distance from MIT, so I just went to Flour for brunch. Flour is a cafe that, for whatever reason, has two locations next to MIT half a mile apart from each other. I’d gone to the Flour on Mass Ave before, but this was my first time going to the other location, which was surprisingly much closer to Simmons.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0515.png]!#@OTTO is a pizzeria from Maine. It’s a popular free food option for student events at MIT, but I’d never eaten at the restaurant in person. I decided to go this time because they had a special promotion with a climbing gym I visit, where showing them your membership tag would get you 15% off your order. The food was… okay, I guess. I’m not a fan of their crust (it’s tough and chewy for some reason), but their toppings are good.!#@p!#@My order:!#@p!#@I know I said I’d try to avoid Maseeh Dining, but a group of my friends had just returned from a trip to Iceland, and they wanted to go to Maseeh because (a) it was close to Simmons, (b) they were jetlagged, and (c) Maseeh has many vegetables (which they were severely lacking in Iceland).!#@p!#@This time, I did remember to take a picture of my food:!#@p!#@For reference, this is the kind of food my friends were eating in Iceland:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-30-at-10.14.48-1-800x602.jpeg]!#@After resting for a day, a few of my friends were ready to eat out again. We went to Nirvana – an Indian restaurant near Harvard. Nirvana is hands-down my top restaurant on this list. The food was just excellent, and it wasn’t too expensive either. Our entire order (listed below, split between three people) cost just over $20 per person!!#@p!#@Our order:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0521.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0522.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0523.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0525.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0526.png]!#@Finally, Simmons Dining opened again! Eating out for the past week was fun, but Simmons Dining is still the only place where it’s socially acceptable for me to get food in my pyjamas.!#@p!#@While returning from Nirvana the previous night, I bought ingredients for mango sticky rice from H Mart.!#@p!#@“How hard could it be?” I thought, “Surely it’s just three ingredients – mango, sticky, and rice?”!#@p!#@Well…!#@p!#@here’s how it turned out.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0539.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-30-at-11.06.24-800x1063.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0540.png]!#@(And this is why I don’t live in a cook-for-yourself dorm.)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6B33C7F86A78-1-800x801.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0471.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0472.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0473.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0515.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-30-at-10.14.48-1-800x602.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0521.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0522.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0523.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0525.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0526.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0539.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-03-30-at-11.06.24-800x1063.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0540.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/114016/
am i boring by Aiden H. '28,or just overstimulated?,by Aiden H. '28,"April 5, 2025","“There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”!#@p!#@— F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@I have come to the profound realization recently that I think I’m boring. I’m not entirely sure where I sit with that.!#@p!#@More importantly, I’ve recognized that the pressure cooker of MIT doesn’t make me feel the academic imposter syndrome everyone prepared me for, but a social one. Why does the “endless” amount of resources and opportunities I’ve been given, and am very grateful for, by this school⁠01 create an inescapable mindset that if I don’t take all of them, I am not fully carpe diem-ing or whatever. Is how interesting I am proportional to my ability to be interesting, to do interesting things at this interesting place? Or to how much I do compared to those around me?!#@p!#@I feel that these questions rooted in our societal issues with the cult of youth blah blah social media whatever whatever late-stage capitalism etc etc mental health aaaaa aaaaaa trap me in a zero-sum game, as if my disinclination for doing much of anything isn’t nearly as bothering to me as it is to the adults who want to live vicariously through me, as if I’m being pursued by these great expectations that precede me, hunting me down into a corner of self-pity and loathing until I realize that it’s all stupid and past me, that I’m just told these things and they echo back in my thoughts as an exposure effect, not an actual feeling.!#@p!#@A lot of these “dilemmas” seem obvious to me, and are just matters of personal taste. Why would I study in the harsh lighting and uncomfortable seats of the Stud when I could easily study in my room, the space I specifically cultivated to be comfortable for me? (This means I spend most of my time in my room.) Why would I consistently spend money to study at a coffee shop when I feel less guilty if I just eat at the dining hall for free? (This means I don’t go to Boston much and I get sick of the food I’m eating.)!#@p!#@I convince myself I want things that I don’t because of these pressures. I fall into the trap of it anyway.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@The most common piece of advice I’ve gotten since arriving at MIT is to try as much as I can. I think that’s bullshit–it’s overwhelming and makes me appreciate everything less.!#@p!#@I deleted over 150 emails from DormSpam today. They were all from the past two days. I don’t read any of the actual email, only the headers, and even then I only skim about half the headers as I scroll through. I’m probably not going to do anything in any of them. It’s too much.!#@p!#@I feel bad that I do none of this, spending most of my time studying and then decompressing through reading/TV/brainrot/croissants, just to start working again. But isn’t that what I’m here to do? Why do I feel so guilty for just trying to fulfill the most basic terms of my commitment to this school? This isn’t to say I’m the 10000%-always-on-the-grind-my-life’s-so-hard-all-I-do-is-work caricature that people impose onto MIT students. I’m kinda the opposite.!#@p!#@For as much as we spit out the phrase “work-life balance”, I feel like I actually have one.⁠02 It feels like the most appealing option for others is just to join the cacophony uttering the phrase and then proceed to not have one, and then I have to convince myself that I shouldn’t feel guilty for not doing the same.!#@p!#@This is the other side of it–if you’re not busy having as much “fun” as possible, you’re busy doing as much “work” as possible. Why can’t I just be neither? Why can’t I do an average amount of work, see an average amount of people/things, and then go to bed at the very normal 11:00 PM to wake up at the very normal 8:00 AM?

Exploring MIT’s sports facilities by Emiko P. '25,there's so much to see!,by Emiko P. '25,"April 4, 2025","It’s a beautiful spring day here at MIT – the sun is peeking through the clouds, I was woken up this morning by birds, and we’ve now mostly exited heaviest-coat-in-the-closet weather (and are now entering bring-your-rain-jacket-everywhere weather).!#@p!#@What better way to enjoy this good weather than by going on a little adventure? I’ve been wanting to do a blog showcasing MIT’s many athletics facilities for a while now, so I think this is the perfect time to do it!!#@p!#@As you may have noticed, I’ve been kind of into the whole tour thing lately. From touring MIT frats and sororities to touring our new on-campus grocery store, it’s been fun to show off a little piece of what makes MIT so unique and special. I’d like to think that there’s something new to be learned for everyone, especially during this tour today – whether you’re a prospective or incoming student-athlete, someone who walks by these facilities on the way to class every day, or someone wondering what do you mean MIT has sports??!#@p!#@Of course, no tour is fun without some tour guides, so I brought along another person with me: Ashley E. ‘25, an attacking midfielder on the soccer team.!#@p!#@Ashley and I met up at the Z Center, which houses the Varsity Weight Room, the varsity locker rooms, the gym, and more that we’ll check out later in this tour!!#@p!#@A short walk away from the Z Center is our first destination: Roberts Field. This turf field is very near and dear to my heart, as I have played dozens of games here and had hundreds of practices.!#@p!#@A good amount of varsity teams call Roberts home. In the fall, women and men’s soccer and football play their home games and practice here. These three teams rotate playing on Roberts and playing on the grass fields in the back (Fields A/B/C/D/E), which I’ll show you later. In the spring, men’s lacrosse claims Roberts Field, while the track team trains and hosts meets on the surrounding track.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-40-25-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-37-01-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-37-00-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-40-07-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-40-09-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@Next, we go to the baseball field right past Roberts.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-41-27-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-41-44-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-56-44-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-56-16-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@Right next door to the baseball field is the softball field!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-45-52-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-45-29-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@There are five grass fields laying just beyond Roberts Field and neighboring both the baseball and softball fields. These are supplementary fields, especially in the fall when three different teams are taking turns practicing on the turf field. The varsity cross country teams also run around these fields multiple times a practice.!#@p!#@It’s also important that I mention that a lot of these facilities and fields are open to the MIT public as a whole, not just varsity athletes. The women’s soccer team often plays on Field D, and the ultimate frisbee club team plays next to us on Field C pretty frequently.⁠01  There are also PE classes that use these fields all the time.!#@p!#@To be honest, these fields do not have the best conditions. It’s pretty bumpy and can be frustrating when you’re trying to fine-tune and practice your technical control with a soccer ball – one wrong bounce and the ball is flying into your shin instead of your waiting foot. On the other hand, these less-than-ideal conditions have forced us to be better, because if you can’t adjust to Field D, you literally won’t be able to play. In that way, the frequent practice on Field D has definitely built character for the women’s soccer team. Whenever we know we’re playing a team and they have a grass field, we make sure to train on Field D so we’re prepared for any condition that can be thrown at us.!#@p!#@At the end of the day: I’m super grateful that MIT has turf and grass fields available for us to use.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-49-03-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-51-19-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Photo-Apr-02-2025-12-43-50-PM-800x600.jpg]!#@Ashley has to part ways with us because she’s running a startup and needs to go talk to an investor, so I begin my hunt search for a new tour guide.

PE classes are…great!? by Aiden H. '28,catch me at the 2028 summer olympics,by Aiden H. '28,"April 3, 2025","Upon admittance, I dedicated a fairly serious and borderline-obsessive amount of time to look through the course catalog and major requirements for every major. Most of this was out of curiosity and to itch the little part of my brain that loves irrationally planning and romanticizing classes.⁠01!#@p!#@So imagine me flabbergasted when I learn that in addition to all the credits for your major, GIRs,⁠02 and HASS requirement,⁠03 MIT is one of the few⁠04 schools that requires PE classes for graduation. Naturally, when people starting asking me about how many classes I had to take/how long until I take classes in my major, the first thing I mention is the seemingly random PE requirement alongside everything, much to everyone’s surprise and curiosity to how it worked.!#@p!#@The rules are as follows:!#@p!#@4-year undergrads must fulfill 8 “points” of PE. Transfer students need 4 points. These can be earned in various ways:!#@p!#@The number of possible classes are extensive and almost overwhelming, but this means that there are enough classes with distinct vibes (e.g. weightlifting vs ballroom dance vs HIIT vs scuba), as opposed to the rigidness of high school PE that a lot of people hated.!#@p!#@Now having completed my PE requirement, I’ve found that they have been some of my favorite “classes” so far and, in a turn of events, I think I’m going to voluntarily continue to take PE classes?!#@p!#@Here’s a recap of the classes I took to fulfill my requirement:!#@p!#@Beginner Yoga (Quarter 1)!#@p!#@This class is located in the T Club Lounge, also known as a random room at the top of the very back of the Z.⁠07 I have no means of comparing this to a yoga class outside of MIT, so how “traditional” it was is beyond me, but I enjoyed the class nonetheless. We mostly focused on learning the basic poses that most of us have heard the names of (the “warriors”, the “dogs”) and some basic salutations and routines that we would repeat.!#@p!#@It was also an evening class, which was very relaxing because at the end of my class day, I would go move slowly and lay down in a dark room with spa music on.!#@p!#@Pickleball (Quarter 2)!#@p!#@Second quarter, my roommates and I decided to take PE together because we all had the same gap in our schedule. Naturally competitive, we thought it would be fun to do something where we could actively compete against each other instead of merely exercise in the same room. With all of us having played pickleball at least once before (and tennis not fitting our schedule), pickleball it was in the Z’s Rockwell Cages.!#@p!#@As grandma as it is, I actually really do like pickleball, and having an excuse to randomly play with friends twice a week was really nice. Like all PE classes, there were specific times dedicated to actual instruction. Having played before, being forced to start with “this is how you hit a ball” was a little annoying, but there’s no way for the instructor to tailor class to everyone’s skill level without starting with the very basics, and I’m not even that good so the extra practice didn’t hurt. I did learn how to serve a lot more aggressively over the course of the class, and I can confirm that my family and friends did notice when they got destroyed over spring break.!#@p!#@The one downside was the class was at 2 PM Tuesday/Thursday, sandwiched right between two of my classes, which meant I got all gross in my day clothes (outfit killer) and then had to arrive borderline winded to my HASS discussion while everyone else was normal (aura killer). This is common for a lot of PE classes and my one complaint. On one hand, I understand that staff work 9-5, so classes are going to be concentrated in those times, but so are lectures. It would be nice if there were a way to take strenuous PE classes like HIIT or weightlifting or spin or anything of the like without having to wear non-athletic clothing and not shower immediately after because of class.!#@p!#@Intermediate Yoga (IAP)!#@p!#@Like beginner yoga, this was in the T Club Lounge and featured a lot of my favorite thing: moving slow! More seriously, I really do like yoga/flexibility in general (especially when compared to an “alternative” exercise of weightlifting or more formalized team sports), and so I was excited to take another yoga class.!#@p!#@This class featured relatively more intense poses and progressions (headstands, handstands) and formalized a lot more of the traditional yoga concepts (dolphin pose, vinyasa breath work and breathing rhythms, etc.).!#@p!#@Beginner Skate (Quarter 3)!#@p!#@This was by far my favorite class purely because of the sheer indulgence of it. I’ve “ice skated” maybe 3 times before, which were almost entirely me and friends failing to skate, falling, and laughing about it. After a good 10 hours of practice through this class, I can semi-confidently say I can ice skate? Above anything, that’s just a funny and random thing to be able to say.!#@p!#@The class is taught seasonally for Quarter 2 through Quarter 3 when the Z has the Johnson Ice Rink up (instead of Johnson track for spring/summer). What was nice is the ice was reserved for class time, so I didn’t have to face the shame of trying to learn how to skate while all the secret hockey players and figure skaters put me to shame during a free/public skate.!#@p!#@The “curriculum” including forward skating, C-cuts, O-cuts, slalom, backwards skating, crossovers, stopping, and then transitions from forward-to-backwards and vice versa.!#@p!#@The instructors we had for this class were just, plain-and-simple, really great teachers who broke everything down to really simple moves that we would build on over time. Before we even started skating, they had us learn to stand upright in the skates without falling over. Then they had us just raise one leg at a time to prove we could balance entirely on one foot. It was small practices like these that made the rest of the class easier. Crazy how learning the fundamentals of something instead of rushing into it because you’re a really stubborn person who wants to be able to do everything perfectly the first time actually works!!#@p!#@Looking forward, there are still two classes I absolutely need to take before I graduate: tennis and sailing. Similar to my logic for ice skating, I think the ability to learn a super niche and fun skill for free is something that I don’t want to take for granted while here. Although the PE requirement seems like a burden, it’s a lot more a burden to pay hundreds of dollars for a local class later in life when you decide you’re actually interested/have the time. Most actual adults have to pay hundreds of dollars for the spin class, so try it now before you have to pay later. Also there’s nothing wrong with the Institute making sure we at least take two hours off a week to go soft brain and smash a ball or whatever.!#@p!#@tl;dr you have to take PE and you’re gonna like it lol!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/pe-classes-are-great/
Rats ! by Shorna A. '25,Foiled Again !,by Shorna A. '25,"April 3, 2025","I did… kind of poorly on an exam recently. This exam (which was for 6.s966, Symmetry for ML) means nothing, in the end. I’ve finished my major requirements; I’m taking classes for my MEng early, so, in theory, I could drop any one of my classes with practically no consequences for my long-term plan. I can drop 6.s966 and absolutely nothing bad will happen.!#@p!#@Despite that, I felt inconsolably bad about the exam for a few days. It’s been a long time since I’ve so thoroughly bungled a test. There are many reasons that this particular mistake happened, including the eclipse of numerous pre-Spring Break deadlines and exceedingly poor sleep, but I’m used to expecting a lot of myself, and I was a bit baffled when I just… couldn’t deliver. The day after the exam, I laid in my bed for a while, staring at the soft eggshell paint of my ceiling and pondering my exam performance.!#@p!#@When I closed that exam book, my exhaustion-addled brain couldn’t suppress the desire to go back just 48 hours, so I could’ve slept just a bit more the past two nights. I wished I could go back a week, so I could fix the bug in my 6.7930 (ML for Healthcare) PSET a bit faster. I wished I could’ve transported myself back to pre registration, to change my course selection. Frankly, any number of different actions at any number of junctures might have prevented this outcome, and, as unimportant as the exam was in the grand scheme, I felt guilty. If I had just had more foresight, known just a little more, I could’ve done something differently and avoided this.!#@p!#@My mind drifted from the exam, eventually. How far would you go back, if you could? What would you do differently?!#@p!#@I often wish I had more seriously considered being a course 7 or 20; I’ve loved every biology class I’ve taken at MIT, but I’m a 6-3, and the waning practicality of cramming a 7 double major into one or two more semesters isn’t lost on me. In the end, a biology major likely wouldn’t have changed much in terms of my trajectory — my credentials as a 6-3 with a 7 minor are not so different from those of a 6-3 and 7 double major. That given, I’m pretty certain I would’ve been happier if I had just taken more biology classes earlier. My motivations for initially forgoing a biology major were complex, but in the end, I think it was a mistake.!#@p!#@I probably should’ve made small changes in my choice of classes, rearranging the order in which I took various courses or optimizing time commitments more effectively.!#@p!#@There are some things I wish I had tried earlier. I started singing at the beginning of college, and I think I’ve gotten pretty good at it, but I regret not starting earlier. At the beginning of this semester, I tried out for three a cappella groups, and was lucky to get into two, but I ended up turning both down. I think if I had more seriously considered a cappella a year or two ago, I would’ve been ecstatic to join such a group. At this point, though, I am feeling pretty fundamentally tired, and realistically, I’m better served by putting my extra time into research.!#@p!#@I’ve included numerous “rationalizations” in the course of listing my mistakes, describing the ways in which they aren’t so bad. Most of these mistakes are, in fact, relatively small, but I’ve certainly made big ones in my time.!#@p!#@Immediately after my botched exam, I took the red line to the Boston Common, where I wandered into a cafe and flipped open a book. After a few hours of reading, I stepped back into the street, greeted by the diffuse brightness of a cloudy sky and a soft, enlivening smattering of frigid mist on my face. I descended the steps to the subway and scanned the pearlescent red tiles that indicate the entrance to the red line. I thought of October of my freshman year, the first time I took the T to the Park Street station with an ex-friend. I was so much younger then, starry-eyed and pathologically prone to seeing too much good in people. I’ve been burned many times because I believed people were kinder than they were. I really regret the friends I chose as a freshman.!#@p!#@I wish I had spent more of my time in Bangladesh talking to my grandfather before he died. I was lucky to spend many, many hours getting to know my maternal grandmother, but my grandfather died in his sleep when I was 10, back when I was barely able to hold a conversation in Bangla. I’ll never get to know him.!#@p!#@I periodically deeply regret not becoming a doctor. I regret how much time I spent feeling abjectly terrible about myself as a child. There was a boy I really wish I had admitted I loved.!#@p!#@All of this is a dangerous rabbit hole. For most of my life, I devoted myself to living without regrets. Having thoroughly demonstrated that I’m a deeply regretful person, this mostly manifested as being as diligent as possible. I didn’t regret exam scores in high school because I was neurotic in my endeavor to avoid such mistakes. This also manifested as a deep-seated phobia of oversights. I didn’t submit my MIT application during the early round, because I felt I hadn’t yet put enough time into the essays. I worried I was in for a lifetime of regret if I submitted early and got rejected. I’ve always spent the full time at every test, triple- and quadruple-checking for errors that I might’ve overlooked. I spent 15 minutes annoyed at myself for the tiny miscalculation I made on my last 7.03 (Genetics) PSET, wishing I had been more attentive. Apparently (according to my very-insistent friends), I am always visibly stressed while driving because I’m compulsively anxious about hitting someone.!#@p!#@The reality is that I’m defined by my mistakes as much as I am defined by my successes. People are like paper. One cannot make it through life without some crumpling. We learn from the ways we crease; the particular mistakes I must guard against are the ones that have, in the past, left the most indelible of marks. I have become infinitely less naive than I was as a freshman. That said, I worry about letting my creases become tears; constantly endeavoring to avoid regrets has (evidently) made me a more tired and stressed person, and my therapist has periodically pointed out my difficulty trusting people.!#@p!#@I’m spending the first half of Spring Break in New York with some friends; today, we visited Flushing. After indulging in some excellent seafood udon and poking around the neighborhood for 5 hours, we boarded the 7 train, which we rode back to Central Station in Manhattan. While the urban jungle of Queens flashed through the windows, I thought, again, about going back to my freshman fall. I would be a different person, now, in any number of ways, if I had to replay my life. More knowledgeable about biology (and probably less well-versed in operating systems). Probably better at singing. Less ridiculous in hindsight, perhaps. Less rough around the edges.!#@p!#@But I wouldn’t be me, and I certainly wouldn’t have been able to develop my friendships in the same ways. As I hefted the stoneware rat statue I had acquired at an antique shop (picture included below! The rats are very cute!), I giggled at a particularly absurd joke my friend had made. In another world, I wouldn’t have gotten the chance to enjoy this reality, which is undeniably pretty wonderful. It’s different from the one I planned, and sometimes different from the one I wish for, but wonderful nonetheless.

'28,"April 2, 2025","Now that I’ve survived enough midterms to know I won’t change my schedule, here it is:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0978-400x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-400x245.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1303-800x1099.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3399-3-800x907.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0920-800x768.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0394-400x533.jpeg]!#@A final paper and exam make up the brunt of your 24.09 grade, but my weekly workload for the class is usually composed of a couple of readings and the occasional video. Additionally, we’re required to post either a question about the reading or an answer to another student’s question with each lecture’s reading, which I like a lot more than the traditional discussion board format that usually consists of a lot of observations about the reading and everyone in the replies simply nodding along. Not only does the question-answer format inspire more interesting discussions, being prepared to question the text I’m reading requires me to think a lot more critically about it than I would otherwise. Asking a good question is often a lot more difficult than answering one is, and I think it’s a great skill to be gained from this course. The most popular questions are discussed at the end of our lectures, which are some of my favorite lectures of the semester. Our professor is super enthusiastic about the subject and makes the lectures entertaining even when I’m pulling up to class first thing in the morning off four hours of sleep. Here are some lecture slides to show what I mean:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3604-scaled-e1743625281559-800x485.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-153322-800x453.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-153859.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-154417-800x448.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-160009-800x453.png]!#@In addition to all the philosophical insight I’ve taken away from this class, it’s also been a welcome change of scenery from the rest of my classes. I spent most of first semester with this on my whiteboard:!#@p!#@I do, admittedly, feel my best when I’m moving very fast. And the mentality encapsulated by this quote is an especially easy one to let yourself fall into as a STEM student, especially at a place like MIT: you want to race through your reading or watch lectures at 2x speed so that you can do your psets as quickly as possible, so that you can get to next week’s psets and get through those as quickly as possible, and now that you have some extra time on your hands you could take a day off but you should work on those personal projects you have on the backburner, and now more psets are dropping so it’s time to grind out those too… I’m not trying to claim that that’s the way it has to or should be: I still make an effort to balance work with everything else, and I have many, many friends here who are way better at that than I am while also doing extremely well academically and professionally. But if you’re like me, then that’s definitely the way it can be.!#@p!#@Approaching my 24.09 readings with that mentality, however, did not go well. It felt like I was sprinting on one of those little hamster wheels, going as fast as I could then finding myself back where I started as I realized that I had not absorbed a word of those four paragraphs I’d just blinked past. This was a new phenomenon for me: I’d spent the first 18 years of my life effortlessly falling into books for hours on end without giving it much thought at all. A HASSless first semester had clearly flipped a few bits in my brain, and I had to remind myself that it was necessary to slow down here in order to nudge them back into place.!#@p!#@When I get really caught up in my work (which is kind of my default state), I tend to turn my life into an optimization problem, and that makes indulging in tiny joys, like taking five extra minutes of travel time to explore a new route to a familiar place or stopping by the Maseeh 3 lounge on my way back to my room, very difficult when they could be dedicated to an iota of a pset instead. But on busy days, those are the things that usually grant me the perspective to fully enjoy everything else. I recently joined MIT’s Science Policy Initiative book club and my friend Christine and I have agreed to read Dostoevsky’s “Notes from Underground” at the same pace, two things that would’ve been unthinkable last semester, when all my spare reading time was “best spent” on combing through research papers for my UROP. In this way, 24.09 has indirectly served as a constant reminder to live my life intentionally and deeply instead of trying to skim over as much of it as I can.!#@p!#@Ok, that’s it. Kidding! There’s one more:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1271-400x300.jpeg]!#@What else am I up to!!#@p!#@I still think it’s insane that I basically just get to do math all day. The amount of fun I’m having with my classes right now, despite lots of them still being fairly general introductory ones, is giving me so much hope for the next THREE YEARS of learning whatever I want at my favorite place on Earth. I’m already looking forward to my next iteration of this post and, like always, I’m grateful for everyone who chooses to make this journey with me through the blog :) let’s hope this next wave of midterm goes well or else I’ll use my soon-to-be-acquired sailing knowledge to ride away down the Charles never to be seen again. i’ve heard nantucket is nice this time of year…!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0978-400x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-400x245.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1303-800x1099.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3399-3-800x907.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0920-800x768.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0394-400x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3604-scaled-e1743625281559-800x485.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-153322-800x453.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-153859.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-154417-800x448.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-160009-800x453.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1271-400x300.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/classes-im-taking-this-semester/
Little Pieces of Living by Sara N. '28,"january & february & march & now, april",by Sara N. '28,"April 2, 2025","In January, I came back to campus for IAP and got to do a healthcare innovation internship at the Boston Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center through one of the MIT Priscilla King Gray (PKG) Public Service Center programs. I was lucky to be surrounded by kind and passionate people who encouraged me to work on projects that interested me, even if they were completely outside of my skillset — this is how I ended up learning C++, Arduino electronics & programming, and survey design + human-centered design interview methodology, all in the span of the month. I shadowed a rounding team at one of the VA campus hospitals, and visited the VA’s Brain Bank, where I held a brain in my hands and then watched a cutting. It was an enriching time for me, and I learned more about what kinds of things I wanted to do more of, and what kinds of things I felt I could do without.!#@p!#@What else? I woke up most days before the sun came up in order to catch the 7:30 bus for the first leg of my morning commute. I shopped at Trader Joe’s for the first time in my life, and grew to love their chicken tikka masala frozen meal. I went bouldering for the first time, despite being solidly afraid of heights, and found that I loved it. One of my roommates was also on campus for IAP, so we cooked a bit together. We made quesadillas with the stove turned on all the way — inadvisable, but much more fun that way — and many servings of pasta. We made pancakes one weekend morning with friends, with chocolate chips & whipped cream & fresh fruit; I’m usually ambivalent about strawberries, but I swear I didn’t have anything short of the sweetest that day. We baked apple cider shortbread cookies with another friend, though the cookies turned out to be dismal in both flavor and texture. But these things happen.!#@p!#@Then there were the days when January felt unbearable and insurmountable. These were the days when it got dark before 5, making almost half my waking day feel like a perpetual 10pm. Even daylight hours seemed restrained and half-hearted. I can hardly remember blue skies, only the tense white-gray of a sky flushed with snow. The wind was largely harsh and uncompromising, and the chill was biting. Some days I would come back from work with swathes of my face and hands red & raw & covered with small, soft bumps — windburn from just minutes of exposure.!#@p!#@If I’m honest, though, I can barely remember those days. Now, when I think of January, I think about the rarer days when the sun was truly out. I think about a wonderful conversation I was lucky enough to have with a doctor I met when I and the other MIT interns sat in on an endoscopy procedure through the VA. I think about the time I had a Subway sandwich for the first time in almost a year and how the time in between made me realize that my regular order was genuinely delectable. I think about the time I stared out the window the entire time I was on the Green Line train and tried my best to look at everything I was seeing. I had There She Goes by The La’s playing on repeat and I had felt like a part of me was soaring.!#@p!#@I am glad memory can work like this.!#@p!#@By the end of January, I was beginning to like Boston. In February, I went out into Boston alone for the first time, an experience that turned out to be so pleasant, I had to write out physical sentences about it afterwards:!#@p!#@Yesterday, I heard birdsong for the first time in months. I was out in Boston, walking along a cobblestoned stretch of Tremont Street, and saw a group of song sparrows darting in and out of and fluttering all around a bare-branched bush that rose till my shoulders. The sky was a real, full-throated blue. It was nearly 3PM, and the sun felt warm; there was no wind. It had snowed almost continuously just days before, but all that snow was now pushed away to the sides in great grey muddy mounds. Everything around me was in smooth, loose motion – the snow-mounds beginning to drip into drains, the thin rivulets of water tracing their way down rooftops & door frames, the sparrows and their unhurried circles.!#@p!#@I still get nervous, like a clenched fist, when I go out into Boston. If I’m alone, I keep a call with my mother running on in the background, just in case, I guess. I don’t know if this nervousness is something I’ll grow out of, or if its just an indelible consequence of growing up away from and a little distrustful of cities, but I think I’m fine either away. I like this tentative thing I’ve got going with Boston.!#@p!#@February was also the start of classes. I had a feeling I would love my spring classes more than I loved my fall classes, and for the most part, I was right. My favorite class right now is Introduction to Machine Learning (6.390), which has helped me appreciate the many moving pieces and the very real math behind the seemingly magical ML algorithms. My recitation professor, on the first day, said something along the lines of how machine learning, to some degree, is all about learning representations of the natural world, and in order to make accurate predictions or classifications or whatever, it has to learn something about us. I think it’s a beautiful idea. The class is hard for me, but I love it regardless, and feel more certain than ever that I want to work in, not just with, machine learning in my career.!#@p!#@In parallel to 6.390: I filled up an entire notebook with Differential Equations (18.03) notes & homework, and am halfway through the new one; I’ve gotten to do some more in-depth readings about the heart for the UROP I’ve been doing since fall semester, and I am still struck by how intricate of an instrument it is; I learned, while studying for the three midterms I had the week before spring break, that I love making crib sheets for exams.!#@p!#@It is April now. Two days ago, I was at home for break. Kentucky was warm and at the cusp of full bloom, though I had to leave before I could see it. Twice in those ten days, I woke up, not to sunshine through blinds, but to birdsong so collectively loud that it clearly permeated through our windows. I did a lot of grocery shopping with my family. I read out loud to my little brother. I ate a lot of good food. Now, I am back on campus.!#@p!#@I wrote this post because I’ve been thinking, recently, of a passage from one of my favorite books of all time— A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith. I read it for the first time when I was 10, and vaguely disliked it. I read it again at 12, and decided it was the most profound, lovely thing I’ve ever read. Since then, I’ve re-read it every other year; last semester was my fifth re-read. In a sense, I’ve grown up with the book. It’s shaped me in a lot of ways, some of which I recognize, many of which I’m sure I don’t. The passage I was thinking of is:!#@p!#@“Dear God,” she prayed, “let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry…have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere – be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.”!#@p!#@I had been thinking about the little pieces of my living that have been lost, and then thought— they can only truly be lost if I let them. This was my attempt to collect some of the details from these past three months. January, February, March. Onto the next.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/little-pieces-of-living/

[Guest Post] A day in my life! by Ellie F. '28,by Callie T. '26,by Ellie F. '28,"April 1, 2025","Hi everyone! I’m Callie T, and Ellie invited me to share what my day looks like as a junior studying physics!!#@p!#@11:15 — I ignore my alarm.!#@p!#@11:20 — My second alarm. I ignore this one too.!#@p!#@11:25 — I roll over at this alarm.!#@p!#@11:28 — This alarm is louder. I start blinking.!#@p!#@11:29 — Another alarm.!#@p!#@11:30 — I slowly get up while cursing at the world.!#@p!#@This term, I promised myself that I’d attend all my lectures to avoid a repeat of last term, and the term before that, and also everything that’s happened since the second term of freshman year. Of course, I have by now missed my 10 am physics lecture. All my sets are terrifying, and I’ve been totally lost in that class for weeks. The current plan is to work on it with some friends after dinner.!#@p!#@12:00 — I grab a sandwich and a large black tea for lunch, and then I take a caffeine pill because a large black tea will not cut it for today. It’s a pretty quick meal, and I run into a few friends that have also just woken up.!#@p!#@12:30 — I try to watch the physics lecture recording from today, but I give up halfway when I realize I don’t know what half the variables mean.!#@p!#@1:00 — I go to economics class. It’s more comprehensible than physics, but I’ve still got a set due tomorrow morning that I need to finish.!#@p!#@2:00 — I write some emails. Then, I preemptively draft an email requesting an extension on the physics set.!#@p!#@2:30 — I try watching the physics lecture again. Doesn’t work the second time either.!#@p!#@3:14 — I work on that econ set. I keep confusing the econ variables with physics variables!#@p!#@4:23 — I dread grad school applications while watching the turtles at the pond where I’m working. I am jealous of those turtles. They don’t have grad school applications. I get another large black tea from Red Door.!#@p!#@4:30 — I continue working on the econ set. I’m nearly halfway through!!#@p!#@5:24 — I take another caffeine pill when I realize I’m blinking extremely slowly.!#@p!#@5:25 — I keep working on that econ set and actually manage to finish it!!#@p!#@5:58 — I head back to Dabney House and doomscroll on LinkedIn while waiting for dinner to start. It’s definitely a good thing that I’ve finished econ, so that I can focus on physics tonight.!#@p!#@6:15 — Dinner begins with the ringing of the bell. Announcements are made while we eat, and I think about my Google Calendar, which I commit to memory every week. At the table, a few of us talk about sleep schedule optimization. I learn that Jason believes in microdosing sleep by taking 1 to 2 hours naps several times a day. On the other hand, Sherry sleeps for 18 hours straight once every few days. Tomas gets a full 6 hours a night but they’re still a frosh so they don’t count.!#@p!#@7:45 — And now the physics grind begins. The other physics majors and I convene and start lamenting our naive choice in major years ago.!#@p!#@9:00 —  I have a shift guarding the school cannon for an hour, to make sure it doesn’t get stolen. In the darkness, I hear whispering sounds. Is it just the wind, or tortured souls whispering integrals?!#@p!#@10:00 — Back to physics! But first, I get a medium black tea.!#@p!#@11:42 — I pass out for fourteen minutes and dream that our beaver mascot is speaking to me. He says, “Callie, what have you become? I am worried about you. Today you were talking to the turtles. They cannot understand you. They don’t even need to apply to grad school. Your life is so much more than sets and lectures and caffeine pills. Do not waste these years. And please get some sleep. Christ.” Then, Bernoulli the Beaver morphs into three turtles that talk in my mom’s voice, asking me when I’ll settle down with a nice boy and also telling me to call her more often. The turtles disappear and are replaced with a large black tea. It says the answer to problem seven is 15.7π m*J/(C*s).!#@p!#@I wake up. My friends are unfazed. I tell them what the black tea told me and Carlos gently informs me that problem seven is supposed to be a proof. I take another caffeine pill. And another one for good measure.!#@p!#@1:15 — my alarm that tells me to get a snack from Red Door goes off. I decide to get a green tea this time, as well as an avocado toast.!#@p!#@1:42 — no progress has been made on physics since the Red Door trip. We do affirmations and pass around a can of Monster for morale.!#@p!#@3:00 — It is now 3 am. Two people have passed out. We have finished two more problems.!#@p!#@4:14 — lpfyhssics /sso hard!#@p!#@4:47— hgfffmmmmghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fjgjjjjjjjjjhhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj!#@p!#@And that’s what my average day at Caltech is like!

Thoughts from Science Bowl 🥣 by Fiona L. '27,a story about now-nostalgic times,by Fiona L. '27,"March 30, 2025","“Fiona, next round, you should use your thumb to push the buzzer, not the palm of your hand.”!#@p!#@“Really? I always thought it was faster. It’s, like, a more powerful movement for me. So I do it with more force.”!#@p!#@“Just trust me. It’s a lot much faster with your thumb. Just always keep your thumb above the buzzer, so you’re always ready to buzz in.”!#@p!#@“Okay.”!#@p!#@Apart from that advice, J was silent as we walked through the corridor to the final round. I looked around the room, at the wood paneled walls, the windows rough with light. We didn’t belong here. Everything here was prestigious. Prestigious chairs, prestigious chalkboards, prestigious emergency signs around every corner. We were just a first time team from an unknown high school, blissfully unaware of the cutthroat competition of the South Bay. How our opponents had trained day after day after blistering day, all for just a chance at victory.!#@p!#@Even the air here felt elite, spiced with fog and pine needles and ambition.!#@p!#@Our final round would follow the same routine as all the others. First, an ice breaker. It was meant to make us relax. We had no chance of winning, but when I glanced at my teammates, I saw the determination etched on their faces. I knew that we all looked to bring a piece of this competition home with us, no matter how tiny.!#@p!#@“Who’s your favorite supervillain?”!#@p!#@We buzzed in to give our answers. Four on one side, four on the other, verifying that all the buzzers worked. I was in the “captain” spot on my team, a symbolic position that changed every round. All I needed to do was report our team’s answers for bonus round questions and sign a scoresheet. Yet something about it made the round feel distinct. Crisp, in a way.!#@p!#@“My favorite supervillain is the Joker”!#@p!#@The previous rounds hadn’t gone very well for me. I forgot the answers to questions I found easy during practice, I blurted out the answer before my team position was called, and I gave so, so many wrong answers. In one round, our coach told me to sit out the next round, switching me with our team’s alternate, who was two years my junior.!#@p!#@“My favorite supervillain is my homeroom teacher.”!#@p!#@I had first started attending science bowl meetings because my friend did. These kinds of clubs were rare for my high school, where most students preferred to participate in mock trial, theater, or athletics. We were an unassuming group of nerds gathered in a biology teacher’s classroom, attempting to excel in something we didn’t know the first thing about. But it was fun–to spend my lunches showing off my skills or learning something new or laughing with people I never thought I’d miss so much.!#@p!#@“My favorite supervillain is my dad.”!#@p!#@After that, all it took was a shuffling of hands and papers until the round began. My heart rattled in my chest. Toss up, physics. A question about the centrifugal force–wait, a trick. I knew this. I buzzed in. “A Captain,” the moderator called out. Maybe it really was faster with my thumb. Acknowledged, I could give my answer. “Zero,” I announced. “That is correct.” My heart snagged on the gap between her words. I exhaled a sigh of relief as my teammates celebrated. My team huddled together as we discussed the bonus question I had won for us.!#@p!#@Toss up, energy. Bonus, energy. Toss up, chemistry. Toss up, biology. Toss up, physics. Four points for every toss up, ten for every bonus. The sound of chalk tallying each win and loss. The whole hour went like this, some toss ups successfully granting their team a bonus question. Some toss ups went unanswered, reduced to just a mark on the scoresheet. I buzzed in for question after question, lectures from my AP classes resurfacing in my mind. Imaginary numbers, momentum, Vieta’s formulas. I never thought I’d remember it all.!#@p!#@“A Captain.”!#@p!#@“A Captain.”!#@p!#@“A Captain.”!#@p!#@I remember my position being called over and over, each time bringing a rush of adrenaline into my veins, the moderators opening the floodgates for the pouring of information from my brain, then the knife’s fall of “right” or “wrong”. I felt like one of Pavlov’s dogs. It was exhilarating. Somewhere down the line was at this moment that I realized how badly we wanted it. How badly we all wanted it.!#@p!#@“You answered more questions this round than in all your others combined.” I had barely processed the end of the round. Slowly, my surroundings came into focus: the cold back of my chair, the sweat lining my palms, the biology teacher’s proud expression.!#@p!#@The round ended when I shook the other captain’s hand and signed my team’s scoresheet, all of it a daze as the last thirty minutes played again and again in my mind. Had I really done it? Had I finally broke my streak of bad rounds?!#@p!#@I looked down at the scoresheet, only examining it closely after I had already signed. There it was. 86 vs. 72. We won.!#@p!#@Author’s note: This post was adapted off of a Vignette I wrote for CMS.587/11.125, Assessing and Evaluating Education. This Vignette was meant to describe a positive assessment experience (where the definition of assessment has been widened from its traditional usage to include recitals, group assignments, and even academic competitions). So, I chose an “assessment that I had a good experience with.” Science bowl. I feel like I’m in such a strange position with my attachment to this extracurricular. I only participated in my senior year. I never became very good at science bowl, nor did I ever go to nationals, yet the memories themselves: of our weekly practices, of our trip to the local competition, at the attempt towards an improbable greatness, still ring more sweet than bitter in my mind, hallmarks of a high school experience I’ll never get back. Science bowl isn’t something I help organize at MIT, nor is it something I talk about or bond over with other MIT students. But it’s something I found fun, and something that I, inadvertently, associate with the simplicity and homeliness of my high school days.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts-from-science-bowl-%f0%9f%a5%a3/
emails to self by Fatima A. '25,& the long goodbye,by Fatima A. '25,"March 27, 2025","what a strange feeling it is to be in your last semester at MIT. there is so much i still wish to accomplish, so many classes i never got to take, so many clubs i was never a part of, so many parts of campus i still have not seen and will probably never see.!#@p!#@life lacks closure like always and recently, i find myself trying and then failing to make sense of this remarkable experience and everything that came with it. i know i have more school ahead of me, but it just will not be the same. although on one hand, i am really excited to spend a lot of time on some relatively narrow area of research, i will also miss the opportunities i have had to explore a lot of different things. i will miss being able to go out to observatories and take writing classes and all these weird strange things that i have collected in the last couple of years. now that i am approaching the end of my time here, i finally feel like i am beginning to get the hang of how to be at MIT, how to make the most of the resources here, how to be someone how can let this place change their life. it leaves me yearning for a do-over, a second chance at the past four years. this is probably not an isolated feeling, and probably why some people go to graduate school; it is not a second chance at being at MIT, but it’s the next best⁠01 thing, i suppose.!#@p!#@more than anything else, i am terrified of saying goodbye to my friends. though, a lot of my friends have already graduated, there was solace in having this one place where everyone could return to. over the last year, graduated friends spread in many places across the US, have returned, and of course, it is not the same, but it was still so nice to see people occasionally. soon, essentially all of us will be spread in different places, with no one place to call home, and that is slightly terrifying.!#@p!#@over the last couple of years, i had committed a large part of myself to other people around me. i wanted to learn what it means to be a person who thinks and feels and has the urge to create something. what does it mean to create something, what does it mean to live a life, and what does it mean to say that you have done so well? these are all questions that defined my path. i am not sure if i have gathered any answers but i have collected a lot of unique stories and experiences and regrets, which all coagulate into some semblance of thoughts.!#@p!#@i had so much hope for myself and the world as a freshman and sophomore and regrettably, the past two years were very effective in erasing most of it. to some extent, there is the perhaps naive discovery that every step you take is in defiance to a system that is built to oppose you rather than support you. on the other hand, i keep learning just how little i could do to cause the change that i hope to see around me. part of it is simply just that my skill set is not that of someone who can make direct change.!#@p!#@i think i have made some things that, if not to anyone else, meant something to me. the work of discovery shall carry on, but i can easily say that i have challenged myself in more ways than i would have expected to and i have changed in more ways than i would have expected to.!#@p!#@i grew up with this strange tradition of the long goodbye, lingering near the door, to delay the parting, coming up with new words and stories to tell. there is such sweetness in this, asking so plainly for a little more time. my 4W friends also share this opinion, i assume, because we also tend to deliver the long goodbye every time someone leaves. walking to the door, or the memorial drive side of next (waving at random cars until you get the right one), or to kendall, or sometimes to the airport.!#@p!#@i am trying to prepare myself for the abrupt goodbye, where one day, we will all get up and leave. yes, we will be in touch, but it will not be the same. something something the joy of living in the same place as your friends. i am greedy to share my life with these people, not just stories from my life. then, there might come a day where we stop talking to each other completely. and for this, no goodbye can be long enough. there is little solace in words. that there is a life to live without the people i discovered my life with—is a heavy feeling.!#@p!#@as much as i wish for the goodbye to be prolonged, a goodbye that lasts a lifetime, we keep moving onwards, and closer and closer to this checkpoint that will inevitably bring about departures. i feel hopeful and miserable, excited and nervous, very happy and extremely sad, disassociating and overthinking, all at the same time.!#@p!#@in a very eternal-sunshine-of-a-spotless-mind-coded way, i do now think that we will still continue to do the thing, because we are humans. even with the knowledge that we might end up hating each other or drifting apart or losing each other in any form, we will jump back up and repeat it all over again. we will continue to love and care and get our hearts broken and then prepare ourselves for the same old business. it is good to know that hurt is never a strong enough inhibitor for humans, that heartbreak only fuels the want to create something, the want to create a life. so carefully and meticulously. the next couple of years are scary to look forward to, and there will likely be lots of sadness and heartbreak, but it only comes because of the beauty of the life and the people i have found here. the hope, then, is only to keep some shadows of this beauty in memories, in occasional meetups and calls, and to keep going headfirst into the next new thing.!#@p!#@during the fall, i made a mailing list, mostly as a joke, called [friend]iscringe, but i started to use it as a place to send semi-regular life updates. i am not sure there is much to be gained from reading these, but it was fun for me to read them again last week, so here i am presenting some pieces of my life this year. enjoy!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email1-e1742618235721.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email2-800x259.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email3-800x517.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email9-800x562.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email10-800x611.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email1-e1742618235721.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email2-800x259.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email3-800x517.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email9-800x562.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/email10-800x611.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/emails-to-self/

Ebony Affair as a Pre-Frosh by Richard O. '28,A Recap of my Experience from the 49th year of the Program,by Richard O. '28,"March 25, 2025","As a pre-frosh, one thing I really appreciated before coming to MIT was how many programs there were to help students become accustomed to the opportunities, resources, and culture on campus. In particular, programs like CPW and Ebony Affair helped me find friends and communities that I continue to interact with and get support from on a daily basis. Looking back though, I remember being hesitant when deciding on whether or not to attend the Ebony Affair program mostly because I wasn’t sure what it would be like. So with that, I wanted to put together a little recap from my experience last year for any current and future pre-frosh undecided on whether they’ll attend to highlight what the weekend encompasses!!#@p!#@(Check out some photos and videos from Ebony Affair here on the Class of 2028 Instagram and similar content for Sin Limite here!)!#@p!#@So for a little more context, apart from Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) which is the main get-together for all admitted students, the admissions office hosts several other preview weekends for admits to engage with different communities here on campus like Sin Limite for the Latinx community and Ebony Affair for the Black community. So I ended up attending both CPW and Ebony Affair which happened over back-to-back weekends and got to interact with so many people during both programs!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7549-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7558-800x451.jpeg]!#@So after getting off my plane I was immediately texted by an admissions officer who was waiting by the pick-up zone with another student attending that weekend and we both headed back to campus in an Uber while discussing different food places in Boston.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8495-800x434.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8494-800x468.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7569-800x451.jpeg]!#@From there, we set up base camp in the admissions office where we were met with free food in their conference room while we got to know each other.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7576-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8493-800x1329.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8497a-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7574a-800x701.jpg]!#@Once most of the group arrived, we took a walk towards the main building, where we met some staff at the Edgerton Center and built little acrylic lights that we got to keep!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7577-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7579-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7582-800x451.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7585-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7586-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7603-800x451.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7598-800x1067.jpeg]!#@Next up was Black Graduation which was a celebratory event held in the Stata Center for seniors in the Black Community to get recognized for their hard work and contributions on campus and receive their kente stole for commencement.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7607-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7610-800x600.jpeg]!#@During the event we got to hear several inspirational messages and performances from varying groups on campus that left half the lecture hall standing up, clapping along, and just vibing to the live music.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8496-800x448.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7611-800x600.jpeg]!#@From there we returned to the admissions office for dinner and met our hosts for the rest of the weekend.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7635-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7640-800x451.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7642-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7643-800x600.jpeg]!#@And it was through my host that I was first really introduced to the Chocolate City community that I’m a part of now.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7645-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7651-800x600.jpeg]!#@Saturday:!#@p!#@The next morning, the admissions office took us to eat breakfast at a local restaurant called Shy Bird near Kendall Square where we got to meet some professors and talk about our plans heading into MIT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7654-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7659-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7670-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7676-800x454.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8498-800x600.jpg]!#@After breakfast we went to the BSU lounge to meet more students in the black community and ask them questions about their experience at MIT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7695-scaled.jpeg]!#@From there we pretty much had free reign in what we got to do before the main event for the weekend which was the Ebony Affair Gala held in Walker Memorial for the entire MIT community.

In the span of 3 days, I got to meet people from all over campus while getting a more in-depth sense of what life at MIT would be like as an undergrad. The program also contributed to my decision to choose Chocolate City as my living community for my first year and exposed me to the fun and supportive culture that existed in the house (which I may write more in detail about in the future). So for any pre-frosh considering Ebony Affair this year or in the future, I would highly recommend attending to help familiarize yourself with all the amazing culture, people, communities, and support groups here on campus!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7549-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7558-800x451.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8495-800x434.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8494-800x468.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7569-800x451.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7576-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8493-800x1329.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8497a-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7574a-800x701.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7577-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7579-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7582-800x451.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7585-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7586-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7603-800x451.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7598-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7607-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7610-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8496-800x448.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7611-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7635-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7640-800x451.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7642-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7643-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7645-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7651-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7654-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7659-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7670-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7676-800x454.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8498-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7695-scaled.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7713-scaled.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7720-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7721-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7735-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7731-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7738-scaled.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7744-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7751-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7756-800x451.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/View-recent-photos.jpeg-800x450.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/26ADA7C2-9E3A-4427-A5CD-DA7313920AB0.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7774-800x451.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7794-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/View-recent-photos.jpeg-1-800x434.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ebony-affair-as-a-pre-frosh/
BLOOD MOON FEST IS REAL!! by Ellie F. '28,"""the blood moon rises and the blood moon falls but the wave of whimsy it brings is eternal"" - my roommate",by Ellie F. '28,"March 22, 2025","Just over two weeks ago, we dropped our Pi Day announcement with Jebby’s Blood Moon Fest blog post. That night, my roommate Anoushka read the blog and immediately told me that we had to make it real. Despite both of our busy schedules, we started scheming of red pies and balloons and some kind of sacrifice, obviously.!#@p!#@Planning began. What I had was two cans of red spray paint and one can of black (from Bad Ideas Weekend), some red and black balloons, a large flat cardboard box that once held a folding table, a giant BLOOD MOON FEST banner, and access to the Simmons ballpit. What I needed was supplies to make pies, something to hold the food, a sacrifice, and time.!#@p!#@I sent out the dormspam.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blormspam-1000x440.png]!#@A few days later, I decided to buy pre-made red velvet cookie dough instead of making pies. I took a trip to Target, which had the added bonus of being a great excuse to procrastinate studying for my two midterms. I also ordered a pink Among Us pinata on Amazon for the sacrifice. By some stroke of luck, I found a large cookie platter at Infinite Reuse, and so now, we had everything we needed for Blood Moon Fest.!#@p!#@The morning of, Anoushka and I got to work in the kitchen, but waiting for the oven to get ready was a bit boring. I commented on her cool key earrings, and suddenly, we were in the Simmons Crafts Lounge, searching for supplies to make Blood Moon Earrings. We tried melting wax first, but the red seals came out a bit small and nondescript. I went to check on the preheating, and though the oven was a toasty 350 degrees, the cookie tray was too big to fit. I hastily started up the other oven.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blookie-1000x462.jpg]!#@I returned to the Crafts Lounge and started scavenging for better earring material. I managed to find four miniature ornaments that we soon tinkered into two pairs of dangling earrings. However, when we victoriously returned to the kitchen, we found that I had somehow failed to preheat the oven, which was instead proclaiming that “Sabbath is on”. Anoushka worked some magic, and eventually we had the cookies in the oven. I rushed over to lunch, and then glassblowing, where I was sniped by Jeremy in all my Blood Moon Regalia.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blearring-2-800x370.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blearring-1-800x759.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blassblowing-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blassblowing-1-800x854.jpg]!#@When the time finally came, I bumped my dormspam, and Anoushka and I hauled all our Blood Moon Inventory to the front of the Stud. As we approached, familiar faces, including Jebby herself, started emerging from the people enjoying the beautiful day. And then, I suddenly realized the aforementioned people were here for Blood Moon Fest. After some Blood Moon Chanting and the indulgence of Blood Moon Cookies, Jebby took the first strike at our Among Us sacrifice, which I had spray-painted red and enhanced with black paint.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-1-800x1732.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-2-800x899.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-3-800x370.jpg]!#@With the lack of any tools, we resorted to variations of stomping, kicking, and throwing the surprisingly resilient pinata. Someone blew up a balloon that we bounced around. A few brave souls took it upon themselves to paint some of the Simmons ballpit balls red in the image of the Blood Moon. More chanting occurred. The Among Us was stabbed. Many things became redder. The cookies were devoured. The event was chaotic and fun and confused many bystanders and it was perfect.!#@p!#@Enjoy a few action shots!!#@p!#@P.S. Neither Anoushka nor I watched the actual Blood Moon. Oops!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blormspam-1000x440.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blookie-1000x462.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blearring-2-800x370.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blearring-1-800x759.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blassblowing-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blassblowing-1-800x854.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-1-800x1732.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-2-800x899.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blamongus-3-800x370.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blood-moon-fest-is-real/
one weekend in March by Kai V. '25,a play-by-play,by Kai V. '25,"March 22, 2025","I’ve been too hosed to write a post that requires beyond-brainstem activity, so instead, enjoy my weekend foray into lifestyle blogging.!#@p!#@9:00 a.m. For breakfast I eat cereal and drink jasmine tea. Then I drive with Mira, another pika resident, to a nearby lake. I’ve been feeling pretty stressed and mentally out of it for a few weeks so I’m hoping to be calmed by a swim in cold water. Mira tells me about her past trips to Denmark and the UK, when she encountered lots of people who made cold plunges a habit for the serotonin boost that followed. When we get to the lake shore, it’s just us and the geese under a cloudy sky. We wade in.!#@p!#@It’s the coldest water I’ve ever swum in, but it’s not as bad as I imagined for water a few degrees off freezing. We stay in the shallows, where our feet can still touch the ground, and get out after a few laps. My whole body is physically pulsing with warmth afterwards, and my breathing is slower and more even than usual. I definitely feel calmer and might try to make this a habit in the future.!#@p!#@12:00 p.m. I have leftover shepherd’s pie and an apple with peanut butter for lunch. Then I work on my overdue pset for 6.7800, Inference and Information. The class gives seven allotted late days, so I won’t incur a penalty for turning this in late. But I’m anxious to finish it on time so I can get started on my work for next week.!#@p!#@2:45 p.m. It’s hard to tell whether I’m making progress on the pset. The later problems center on the expectation maximization algorithm, which is a cool way of doing parameter estimation for complicated probability distributions. I’m helping to run a social event for pika later today that needs snacks, so I head to HMart to buy them with house budget. I end up buying a bunch of stuff that’s coincidentally green: wasabi peas, mochi, a matcha swirl cake.!#@p!#@4:00 p.m. The event was slated to start at four, but pika’s stewards have just returned from Costco with our weekly food haul! I help them put away the groceries. pika runs a daily dinner mealplan that anyone can sign up for if they also sign up for a cook or clean shift every 1-2 weeks, and house members also use in-house groceries to make themselves breakfast and lunch. So we get a lot of groceries from Costco to provide for this, a job assigned to our stewards.!#@p!#@4:15 p.m. We run the event: a paint social, where we provide paint, canvases, and brushes, and pikans come paint what they want. We’ve run this once before, and my favorite part is when people who haven’t painted much before join and discover that painting is really fun and relaxing. I work on the same painting that I started last time.!#@p!#@6:30 p.m. House dinner is called!!#@p!#@7:24 p.m. I walk to campus for a performance called As Stars, Our Sacrifices (which Andi Q. ‘25 was in as part of MITWE!) that centers around human-induced environmental damage. It’s really beautiful, and it’s in the new music building which I’ve never entered before today. Embarrassingly, I’m very affected by live orchestral music, so I start crying like four measures in and don’t stop until the end.!#@p!#@10:00 p.m. I arrive back at pika and do more work on my pset.!#@p!#@12:42 a.m. My brain is not really functioning anymore so I go to sleep.!#@p!#@5:11 a.m. I get up to finish the pset. Getting up early to finish work is a bit stressful but I’ve never been able to stay up late and remain focused, so waking up before dawn it is. Fortunately I always feel locked in in the morning when no one else is awake.!#@p!#@8:20 a.m. I submit the pset! Then I shower and start reading the report I have to critique for 8.14, Experimental Physics II (the sequel to Junior Lab). In the spirit of peer review, each of us has to read a past student’s work and write a referee report. The paper I’m assigned is about observing hyperfine structure⁠01 using Doppler-free spectroscopy⁠02 , which makes me really happy: I think, in another life, I’m an experimental atomic physicist. In fact, I definitely would have tried to angle myself towards grad school for atomic physics if I’d learned about it earlier. As it stands, I had no idea what it entailed until my junior spring when I took a graduate AMO⁠03 class on a whim, and by then it felt too late to reroute my entire undergrad towards an atomic physics PhD. I’m happy where I am, but I don’t feel as excited by anything else in science, so it makes me wonder sometimes what could have been. Anyway—this is all to say that I had a wonderful time doing the assignment!!#@p!#@12:20 p.m. I wander downstairs where people are chatting after brunch. Someone has made a giant tray of vegan blueberry muffins. I eat like six of them. Then I have to do my SHITs (Sunday House Improvement Tasks, the one-hour-per-week obligation for each pikan to do some cleaning task to keep the house tidy), so I grab some bleach and toilet cleaner and scrub down the bathroom on my floor.!#@p!#@3:10 p.m. Yesterday was a pika resident’s birthday; today, she is holding a celebratory tea party! She offers us Chinese white tea, cucumber finger sandwiches, and home-baked cookies. Some people queue up to play the piano in the background. Someone eats a whole avocado like an apple (yes, including the pit—they just bite into it, which I didn’t know was possible). I curl up on the corner of the couch and work on debugging code for my UROP.!#@p!#@6:15 p.m. We have dinner and then our weekly house meeting.!#@p!#@9:15 p.m. Some pikans start watching Severance, so I join them for a couple of episodes. It’s really good!!#@p!#@11:30 p.m. I wonder if it was worth sinking two hours into Severance when I have a bunch of work due tomorrow. It’s okay: I’ll get up early to do it.⁠04!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/one-weekend-in-march/

I’m on a mission to spread the New England winter propaganda, and that means more snow shenanigans!

Even better, right outside of the dorm where Siyi and I live is Briggs Field, the massive recreational field separating dorm row (where most of MIT’s undergrad dorms are) from Simmons Hall and several of the graduate dorms.

concord market is finally here!!!!! by Emiko P. '25,feasting at MIT's on-campus grocery store,by Emiko P. '25,"March 21, 2025","The day I’ve been waiting for has finally arrived.!#@p!#@For over 20 years, the Student Center housed an MIT treasure: LaVerde’s, our beloved on-campus grocery store. 01  Sadly, in the winter of my sophomore year, LaVerde’s permanently closed its doors.!#@p!#@The months passed. Students who had loved LaVerde’s graduated, and new freshman arrived to MIT, never having felt the warmth and tenderness (and blow to the wallet) of an on-campus grocery store.!#@p!#@With LaVerde’s closure, the bustling grocery store on the first floor of the Stud turned into a boarded up, blank wall of plaster. It was sad, but the heartbreak was eased because we were promised a new store: Concord Market.!#@p!#@Since then, over two years passed. To tell you the truth, it seemed as if all hope was lost. I thought I would graduate and never get to lay eyes on Concord Market. I thought my on-campus grocery store dreams were over: no more quick lunches in between classes, no more much-needed energy drinks on test day, no more yummy snacks to gift my soccer teammates. I had accepted that this would just have to be my reality.!#@p!#@Until…!#@p!#@The grand opening of Concord Market on March 11, 2025!!#@p!#@I walked into the Stud one morning, over two years after I had last eyes on LaVerde’s, to see a beautiful sight in front of me: a crowd of students coming in and out of a bustling grocery store with a huge CONCORD MARKET sign.

Last fall, we welcomed our first group of high school juniors specifically from rural and small-towns to experience life at MIT and gain insights into the college application process—through the unique lens of being from a small-town or rural community.!#@p!#@As part of our commitment to expanding college access to small-towns and rural students through the STARS College Network, 32 institutions across the country, including MIT (a founding member), are launching programs to bring students to campus and help them envision themselves in these spaces. Instead of just telling you how impactful this experience was, we want you to hear directly from one of our STARS Ambassadors, Vaneeza—a current MIT student who played a key role in planning the weekend and hosting one of our visiting students. While we work behind the scenes to open applications and plan for the Fall 2025 STARS@MIT Fly-In, take a moment to read about the program from Vaneeza’s perspective!!#@p!#@Building Connections through Shared Small-Town Experiences
In October, MIT Admissions hosted its first STARS@MIT Fly-in program, bringing 20 high school juniors from small and rural towns nationwide to MIT for a three-day visit to learn about the college application process, MIT, and attending school in an urban environment. As one of the STARS Ambassadors, I helped plan and host activities during their visit.!#@p!#@My fellow STARS Ambassadors and I met the visiting students on the first evening and played a game of “Rural Students Bingo,” in which we try to fill a bingo card by finding people with different interests and backgrounds, ranging from traits like having grown up on a farm to liking sci-fi movies. This was a fun way for us to break the ice and learn a little about each other before spending the next two days together. At dinner afterwards, we got a chance to really sit down and get to know each other; I learned about the students’ lives at their schools, and we got to tell them about our experiences at MIT. It was amazing to chat with the students about everything from their research projects plans and internships opportunities, to even just living in the city. These conversations were a great precursor for what followed throughout the weekend: an exchange of lifestyles and goals through the lens and trust of a shared background.!#@p!#@Navigating New Environments!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/balloon.jpg]!#@Throughout the program, the visiting students impressed me; this was such a new environment, and for many this was the first time flying on a plane, riding a subway, or just being away from home. The way they embraced the new experiences with excitement to learn, insightful questions, and eagerness to explore was incredible to see.
The admissions office hosted workshops on how to balance academic and social goals with financial considerations in the college search process (it’s hard to do!) and how to showcase strengths such as resilience, community involvement, and other characteristics often found in small-town and rural communities in their applications. Our goal for the program is to really teach the students that they have so much to offer their future college communities!!#@p!#@A key part of finding success in the college search and application process for rural students is also gaining the confidence that they can navigate their future campus environment. So why not adventure around the city we call home? In small groups, we took the students to the famous historical Beacon Hill via a public transportation tutorial. I remember when I first came to MIT that the T was this scary mysterious thing that I was afraid to learn!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Halloween-400x488.jpg]!#@to use. I had never lived in a place with any kind of public transportation, and the thought of doing the wrong thing or getting on the wrong train was terrifying. Now I know the T is a great luxury that provides a ticket off campus that is both affordable and easily accessible, and it was really lovely getting to share that experience with the visiting students. We walked through Beacon Hill and Boston Common in what had to be the nicest weather October has ever seen and got to showcase the beauty and history of the area. This was a highlight of the weekend for me because I got to explore the city in a way I never had before and share the experience with students who were so excited about every new thing we saw. 

Discovering Belonging

Throughout the visit, there were lots of opportunities to build strong connections with the students and help make our campus feel like a home. One way I got to do this was by hosting a student in my dorm. Having a student spend the weekend with me meant that we had!#@p!#@plenty of time to talk about all sorts of things, from new hobbies we were learning to crazy hometown tales. I also got to show them around my dorm, Simmons Hall, and how we have built a community of our own here. Since Simmons is a place where we encourage drawing on the walls, my visiting student got to leave some artwork of their own, physically cementing their place in this community. Having this time to get to know one of the students on a more personal level was wonderful because I got to share some of my favorite parts of my!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chalkart.png]!#@community with them and hopefully show them how easily a campus can feel like a home.!#@p!#@At the end of the jam-packed weekend, the STARS Ambassadors hosted an MIT scavenger hunt where students used what they learned over the past two days to navigate campus more independently, hitting landmarks like the Banana Lounge, Killian Court, and the Borderline Murals. It was super fun to see the students confidently find their way after such a short time, which I hope is a sign that they enjoyed being on campus. Watching all the students work together to solve the clues and have a good time also showed me the sense of community and friendships they had formed with each other. This helped me realize that beyond finding belonging on our campus, these students now also have a community amongst themselves which they can lean on during their college application process and beyond. They can support each other knowing they each understand each other’s backgrounds and the goals they hope to achieve.!#@p!#@STARS discover campus during scavenger hunt 

Lasting Impact!#@p!#@One conversation that stood out to me was halfway through the program when I asked a group of students how they were liking the visit and if they thought they might attend a school like MIT in the future. Everyone said they were having a good time, but one student had decided this was not the environment they were looking for during college. That was a reminder of how important these types of programs are beyond learning how to strengthen applications or how to navigate a city; this student was now able to make a more informed choice about where he wanted to spend the next four years. Even if they decided the city was not for them, they would never be left wondering “what if?” and that is why I am so happy to have been a part of this program–because we are able to share perspectives and experiences that these students so often don’t get the chance to experience in high school, especially from these small-town backgrounds where many people rarely leave their state.

I enjoyed helping host this visit for many reasons. It was great to meet prospective students and see them excited about starting the next chapter of their lives. I was also super impressed by how open they were to exploring the area and talking with us and each other because I know how scary moving into this new type of environment can be. Seeing the students also reminded me of how much I’ve learned and grown since being on campus, and it was very fulfilling to see such deserving students get a chance to explore college in a way that has been historically unavailable to so many from small-town and rural backgrounds and start that journey themselves. Overall, I am so grateful to have been a part of this inaugural program not only because it was so fun to meet and host students and share my new home with them, but also because I got to see the impact this type of program is having on students by showing them that their perspectives are valued on our campus and by hopefully showcasing that they have so many great options for their futures.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/entrance-400x299.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/balloon.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Halloween-400x488.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chalkart.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/entrance-400x299.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-small-town-and-rural-students-take-on-mit-and-boston/
MIT Dining Halls by Aiden H. '28,my controversial ranking,by Aiden H. '28,"March 19, 2025","One of my biggest plights with MIT is how, since they kinda know that people will always want to apply/commit, there isn’t as much of a need to wow students as there is with a state school or a small liberal arts college, per se. We don’t need to spend the money on a huge, beautiful quad, seasonal flowers, pretty architecture, AC in dorms, or just generally any good sense of spatial planning.⁠01 As much as I don’t want to admit it, I do want these “superficial” things for comfort and vibe.!#@p!#@Accordingly, MIT lies in this awkward liminal space between having some of the nicest amenities and facilities, and some pretty awful ones. Arguably, the most talked about is campus dining/food. MIT has historically been a food desert, Cambridge/Boston isn’t necessarily a “campus town”, so surrounding restaurants are adult-expensive and not college-kid-expensive, and the Stud’s years of renovations have taken and replaced a bunch of campus restaurant and grocery staples. This leaves a lot of the undergrad populations to eat at the (in)famous dining halls.!#@p!#@I find it fairly obvious which dining halls are better than others, but the overall inconsistency of dining leaves me and my roommates arguing about where we should eat to have the highest probability of having something we could actually enjoy instead of just tolerate. Therefore, I find it appropriate to provide my official ranking so as to close any debate around the subject.!#@p!#@I will be using the following criteria:!#@p!#@With that, I present my ranking:!#@p!#@AAAA! AAAA! Don’t make me eat here, it makes me sad.!#@p!#@Quality: ⭐⭐ – Everything I’ve ever had here was really dry. Nothing was inedible or super disgusting, and it might have just been a menu thing, but I’ve never like anything here.!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐ – This is the reason McCormick is so low for me. Even though other dining halls have comparable quality, McCormick is wayyyy too small. There’s pretty much only ever two options for a meal and then the salad bar (which isn’t nearly as decked out as other dining halls). Committing to McCormick is committing to one meal.!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – McCormick is generally close enough to most of campus that it’s accessible to pretty much everyone without complaint, except maybe Simmons/Next, but these have their own dining halls so I can’t imagine anyone walking specifically for McCormick dining.!#@p!#@Staff: N/A – Didn’t have any interaction with any staff.!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐ – The dining area is way too cramped for seating and the kitchen can only really fit people in a single-file line. Very elementary-school cafeteria vibe. I don’t get claustrophobic in an anxiety way, but I do get claustrophobic in an I’m-hot-asf-and-need-you-to-shut-up-so-we-can-get-out-of-here passive- aggressive way. McCormick does not trigger a good side of me.!#@p!#@Maseeh (C)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maseeh-800x541.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maseeh-2-800x530.jpeg]!#@Quality: ⭐⭐ – Maseeh is notorious for having the most questionable quality. Although I would argue that Masseh has been marginally better for lunch this semester than last, it is pretty undeniable. Because Maseeh is closest to class buildings, it’s a much more popular option for lunch than for dinner. This shows in the quality. Dinner is back-and-forth between pretty good and bowl-of-green-sludge. Maseeh has no “middle”–it’s either good or bad, and statistically it feels a little to that lower side.!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 – Maseeh is one of the biggest, if not the biggest dining hall on campus. It also has the largest dedicated kosher station and a guaranteed “Indian” food section that has to have a vegetarian and/or vegan option. Basically, Maseeh always has the following options:!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – As aforementioned, Maseeh is on Mass Ave. right next to the Stud and the class buildings, so it is pretty accessible, which makes it the main draw for people who don’t live in Maseeh to eat here.!#@p!#@Staff: ⭐⭐ – Half of the staff are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. The other half like to actively insult the other chef’s food in some sort of weird pissing contest, which just leaves students standing there as they talk about how the food we’re eating sometimes looks like sewage.!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐ – Maseeh has some of the most seating and some bay windows, which doesn’t make it completely ugly. Still, it’s not the cleanest as a building and I’ve only ever seen mice while eating in Maseeh.!#@p!#@tl;dr you’ll probably eat here for lunch, check the dining website menu before considering dinner!#@p!#@Baker (C)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bakerup-800x510.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bakers-800x532.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/baker-800x532.jpg]!#@Quality: ⭐⭐⭐ – Baker might not have better meals necessarily, but it is much more consistent than a dining hall like Masseh. I’ve never seen anything sludge-like.!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐⭐ – Similar to McCormick, Baker only ever has two options, and a lot of the time they’re the same thing. However, Baker does have the grill and stir-fry stations, where you can get food made-to-order (burgers, quesadillas, stir-fry). The grill helps Baker a lot, but it can get pretty repetitive and not healthy.!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Baker is kind of the exact middle dorm on the south/river side. No one has ever complained about walking to Baker.!#@p!#@Staff: ⭐⭐.5 – Not a lot of notable staff interactions, but sometimes the grill and stir-fry workers can take a really long time to make orders and then end up messing them up. This is fair because they’re definitely overworked and underpaid, but it also does mean that I’ve waited 30 minutes for a quesadilla that they ended up putting chicken in (I’m a vegetarian).!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐⭐ – Baker has two floors of eating which is pretty cute. The tables and chairs are unnecessarily uncomfortable though, all being this rounded, shiny plastic wood. The lighting is also a little off and ventilation is low, so it’s a pretty humid experience.!#@p!#@Simmons (B)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/si-800x531.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/simseats.jpg]!#@Quality: ⭐⭐⭐.5 – I don’t eat at Simmons that often, but I’ve never had anything bad. They also have jalapeño poppers that I devour.!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐ – Simmons does have a smaller-sized dining hall, which is weird considering its size. There are typical 2 meal options, but then still a full salad bar, grill, and stir-fry, so it’s not as deprived as something like McCormick.!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐ – Simmons is at the far end of west campus on the north side. If you don’t live at Simmons, you’re not going to walk past every other dining hall option for something that isn’t that notable.!#@p!#@Staff: ⭐⭐⭐ – Nothing of note. There is an issue with getting a dishwasher, though, so I think it’s been only paper plates and utensils for a while?!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐⭐ – The dining area is extremely tight and crowded, and, in typical Simmons fashion, the lighting is so awful you can’t see anything. Oh, and it’s that weird concrete again, because duh.⁠03!#@p!#@Next (A)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/next-grill.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/next-2-800x448.jpeg]!#@Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – It’s rare that something here is actually disgusting (minus that one time it was apple cider tofu). More consistent than other dining halls, but there is a lot of repetition, notably with the vegetarian options (tofu and rice, basically).!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐ – I would say Next and Simmons have the same amount of food options. Two meals, a grill, stir-fry, salad bar, and then the typical breads/toaster/soup/cereal combo that everything has.!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐ – Same as Simmons, it’s on the far end, just on the south/river side. Nevertheless, it’s not that bad of a walk, and I eat dinner at Next more often than anywhere else. In the harsh winds of IAP, skipping Next is understandable. When it’s nice out? I think some (most) MIT students just hate walking and need to figure that out lol!#@p!#@Staff: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – The Next House dining staff are maybe the most famously nice? There are two guys specifically, one on grill and one on stir-fry, who go out of their way to make conversation and are just generally nice/approachable instead of offering a blunt “What do you want” (or the even more common dining hall worker stare, in which they don’t address you at all and just expect you to start talking).!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – BOOTHS! Next dining has booths that overlook the river, making it by far the most comfortable dining hall. One star off for the bad lighting and overall Next House vibes though.!#@p!#@Next will always be a solid choice, and if I was making someone non-MIT try a dining hall, it would definitely be Next.!#@p!#@New Vassar (A)!#@p!#@Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 – A similar argument to others, but Vassar is just more consistent and you know what you’re going to get going in. Vassar has a more American-leaning focus than some other dining halls like Maseeh, which try to have more global foods. For dinner, Vassar always has a grill section with a bunch of premade burgers, chicken, onion rings, fries, etc. that are better than other grill sections. For breakfast, Vassar also has the best omelet station because they let students cook their own omelets, and they have actual whole eggs (so that you could do fried/scrambled eggs as an alternative, which is not available at other dining halls because they use the liquid eggs only), and sometimes do a special waffle bar with various fruity and sweet toppings. .5 off though, because in my heart I cannot say it is restaurant quality, and I’m never foaming at the mouth to eat here.!#@p!#@Quantity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – There is a dedicated vegan section on top of the regular 2-3 hot meals prepared, along with the grill, stir-fry, and impressive salad bar (see: Salad Bar rank below). Vassar also has some unique foods that other dining halls don’t always have (sunflower butter, more types of jam/jelly, more types of pastries available every day instead of sporadically).!#@p!#@Distance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Vassar is right behind the Z, making it not far from anything, but only really “close” to Simmons.!#@p!#@Staff: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – I don’t know what they’re giving these people but sometimes they can be too nice. I’ve had people at the vegan station practically bless me and my family when I ask for food.!#@p!#@Vibes: ⭐⭐⭐ – I heard New Vassar used to be a parking garage, and I can’t unsee it. The vibe of the whole building, inlacing the dining hall, is very sterile. The chairs and tables are also mildly uncomfortable, but not unbearable. Being a bigger dorm though, there is ample space and seating.!#@p!#@*SPECIAL* Salad Bar: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Vassar wins on the salad bar. It has the largest salad bar, the most dressing options, and the most interesting options. The salad bars in other dining halls are mostly just random cut-up vegetables, which means your only option is some type of lettuce, bell peppers, shredded carrots, and cucumber. Vassar has all this, but then actually puts out interesting stuff (a premade salsa, seasoned tofu, feta or blue cheese, a Japanese cucumber salad instead of cucumbers, etc.).!#@p!#@That’s the end of my ranking. I’ve had a fair share of struggles with adjusting to the dining hall food, so I definitely recommend trying a lot of options if you get a chance.!#@p!#@(Still not as bad as Harvard though.)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maseeh-800x541.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maseeh-2-800x530.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bakerup-800x510.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bakers-800x532.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/baker-800x532.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/si-800x531.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/simseats.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/next-grill.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/next-2-800x448.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-dining-halls/
speaker talks and gallery shows by Gloria Z. '26,+ other cool stuff yay,by Gloria Z. '26,"March 18, 2025","This semester, I’ve really been trying to take advantage of MIT’s deep well of events: book talks, participatory activities, gallery openings, film screenings… the list goes on! SHASS⁠01 , DUSP⁠02 , and the Architecture department tend to host or promote a lot of these events, in addition to more large-scale happenings at the List Center for the Arts, the Wiesner student gallery, and the MIT Museum. While MIT is known primarily for the T in Technology, it also has a super vibrant and scholarly humanities and arts scene, particularly in disciplines like comparative media studies, urban planning, history of architecture, etc. For example, did you know that DUSP is home to the largest urban planning faculty in the United States?? There’s also a graduate program in science writing, a degree specializing in Islamic architecture, research labs in experimental new media art, etc… I entered MIT perceiving its graduate research sphere as a place filled primarily with advanced scientific endeavors–and that it has, but it also has so much more.!#@p!#@These corners of the school tend to be less undergraduate-heavy, populated primarily by researchers and professors in the specific department. Their events, though, are usually open to all MIT affiliates, and when I find pockets of time to check them out, I always find them extremely valuable and interesting. So–in the past month or so, here’s what I’ve seen!!#@p!#@As part of an on-campus program called MIT Arts Scholars, we get exclusive access to arts events in the greater Boston area, including performances, artist talkbacks, and lectures. This was one such event: we had the opportunity to preview Gómez-Egaña’s show, The Great Learning, which he was setting up in the List Arts Center. It was super inspiring to see a large-scale installation in the midst of construction, as the artist was still making decisions about what to include, where to put things, and how viewers would interact with the space–in the midst of the creative process.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mit-list-pedro-gomez-egana_the-great-learning_0225_0039.jpg-800x600.webp]!#@From the website description: “[Gómez-Egaña draws] on practices of composition and choreography to create dynamic constellations of objects and events in time.” Without spoiling too much, I especially loved his use of slow, measured movement using magnets and physical systems; definitely encourage seeing the show before it closes in July.!#@p!#@In this book talk, Juul gave an overview of, in his eyes, the five ways the Commodore 64 computer⁠03 has influenced games, digital culture, and the world at large. I’m really fascinated by retro tech and games (any Pico-8 fans in the chat), so I had to pull up. It’s really interesting how portable computers were marketed back before they became ubiquitous, as tools for connectivity or machines for gaming or otherwise, and I feel like those patterns mirror the way that new personal tech (like biometrics wearables or VR gadgets) are advertised nowadays.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/commodore64-400x300.jpg]!#@I went to this event (and most of the other ones in this list lol) with my friend Sabine! It was part of a free film festival that’s hosted by a variety of Women’s and Gender Studies departments across universities, focusing on 1) issues relating to gender, race, sexuality, class, feminism and 2) films directed by women.!#@p!#@This particular film focused on the stories of climate activists in the Pacific Northwest as they fought legal battles and resisted the encroachment of oil trains and spills throughout their land. It was interesting to see the legal basis they argued on–the necessity defense; and the story ended well. I find it hard a lot of the time to fight climate doomerism/pessimism though, maybe due to lack of information, so I’m trying to learn more, and this is part of that.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/thingreenline-800x1036.png]!#@In this talk, Marcus discusses his research and recently published book on what he calls “spatial capital.” Essentially, he argues that land has been disregarded in contemporary urban/economic studies as a fundamental production factor alongside labor and capital (money). Thus, we must effectively model and synthesize spatial data alongside other forms of data in order to effectively address social and environmental issues.!#@p!#@I think this is more salient than ever as the US faces a critical housing shortage and the world condenses (more than half of the world’s population now live in urban areas :0), and I liked the segments where he discussed ways of actually quantifying spatial metrics through geometry and map data. Also they had really good Mediterranean food!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spatialcapital-400x300.jpg]!#@This mini-show was put on by Future Sketches, a research group in the Media Lab that explores technology and computation as mediums for art and design. Specifically, Future Type featured their work related to typography and letterforms. This semester, I’m taking a class taught by Zach Lieberman, who leads Future Sketches, so we just went to see the show as a class and he (& the TAs) talked about the technical details behind some of the work on display. It was very cool!! I really want to try making interactive/projected media of my own. I’m dumb and didn’t take any photos/videos so uhh… have an Instagram link instead :D.!#@p!#@This talk was structured as a conversation between Jonathan Tarleton (a DUSP alum) and Justin Steil (a law/planning professor in DUSP). Tarleton discussed his recent book, which traces the stories of two social housing co-ops in New York City as they contemplate potential financial and social changes. It includes interesting questions pertaining to property ownership and social obligations to our communities and future generations. I feel like homeowning has been sold for so long as the last destination on the American Dream Journey™, a prospect which feels more and more out of reach as real estate prices soar, so it was enlightening to hear his thoughts on how and why social housing programs like these can succeed at all levels.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/socialhousing-400x300.jpg]!#@I went to this same event last year and it was really cool! Basically, MIT Libraries featured some curated selections from their Distinctive Collections. They had art books, tarot cards, experimental print media, and just generally interesting art objects. I especially enjoyed this piece by Rhiannon Skye Tafoya:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/weaving-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/weaving_caption-800x1067.jpg]!#@The weaving techniques are so beautiful and remind me of some of the pixel-manipulation artwork we looked at in my creative computation class (the one w/ future sketches) recently:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kenknowlton.jpg]!#@This info session detailed the exact requirements for getting licensed as an architect, which is what 1) allows you to call yourself an architect 2) allows you to “stamp” or greenlight designs and 3) allows you to start your own firm. Turns out, the process is way more extensive than I thought: after completing an accredited⁠04 B.Arch or M.Arch, you then need to complete 3,740 hours (!!!) of on-the-job experience and take six multi-hour standardized tests covering different aspects of architectural practice. Only then can you call yourself an architect. I guess it makes sense–a lot of things fall under the purview of an architecture firm, from construction/budget management to minute design details, so it’s probably good to only allow experienced professionals to make literal buildings. Plus, you can still work at an architectural firm, e.g. as a staff designer, you just can’t be the principal on a project or something like that. But still – damn!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/arch_sandwiches-400x533.jpg]!#@4.14 is a class about typography and translation, taught by Bo-Won Keum, a graphic designer and lecturer in the architecture department. I took it last spring, when it was offered under a different course number (4.s00), so when she pubbed this year’s guest lecture over email, I decided to listen in on the Zoom. It was super cool⁠05 –Bye Bye Binary is a French-Belgian art collective, working primarily in type, but also performance, writing, and general graphic design. Through their work, they try to construct a more inclusive and “post-binary” version of the French language, which is historically very gendered, while challenging traditional notions of what constitutes good design. I really liked this slide from their presentation:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bye_bye_binary-400x289.png]!#@For some context, Cambridge recently⁠06 passed the biggest zoning modification in the city’s history, creating one of the most progressive zoning codes nationwide. In short, they adopted multifamily zoning citywide, replacing a complex patchwork of complex regulations and mostly single-family zoning. This is a big deal!! In this talk, Burhan Azeem (actually an MIT alum in course 3) detailed his efforts over the past 5+ years to help push through this legislation, both as a city councilor and community organizer. It was really fascinating to hear him speak about the political side of things, such as strategies to convince constituents and other councilors of the merits of the new code, as well as ways these changes could reverberate in other Boston-area municipalities.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/burhan_azeem-400x300.jpg]!#@& that’s all! Hopefully as the semester fully ramps up I’ll still have the bandwidth to make it to talks like these; I think having access to the graduate programs’ resources and events is a really valuable part of MIT’s undergraduate education, and it helps expose me to so many new ideas and areas of study. :-)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mit-list-pedro-gomez-egana_the-great-learning_0225_0039.jpg-800x600.webp;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/commodore64-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/thingreenline-800x1036.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spatialcapital-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/socialhousing-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/weaving-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/weaving_caption-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kenknowlton.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/arch_sandwiches-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bye_bye_binary-400x289.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/burhan_azeem-400x300.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/speaker-talks-and-gallery-shows/

MIT Regular Action Decisions Now Available Online by Chris Peterson SM '13,,by Chris Peterson SM '13,"March 14, 2025","MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2029 are now available in the application portal. To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update.!#@p!#@This year — inclusive of both Early and Regular Action — 29,282 students applied to join the MIT Class of 2029. As of (checks watch) right now, we have offered admission⁠01 to 1,324 students who have the opportunity to collectively climb the mountain that is MIT.!#@p!#@These 1,324 students hail from all 50 states, 62 countries, and nearly a thousand different high schools. Though their interests and aptitudes range widely — cosmology and cosplay, quantum and quilting, agriculture and archery — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and other areas of scholarship to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind. We can’t wait to welcome them to convocation in Cambridge this fall, where they will join the ~4,500 outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home.!#@p!#@There are also students who may be climbing other mountains, with other fellow mountaineers, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a modest number on our waitlist and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2029. Getting to “meet” so many capable, compassionate students through this process has, as always, left us bleary-eyed and reminded us that what we do is more than a job: it is a privilege and an honor. We are grateful to have walked this short part of your path with you.!#@p!#@If you are among the many stellar students to whom we are not offering admission, then I want to remind you success is not always a straight line. Your future isn’t something MIT creates for you, it’s something you manifest for yourself. And if you spend the next few years trying to make wherever you are as amazing as you can (as you already are), then someday you’ll look back on this Pi Day and realize it all worked out okay.⁠!#@p!#@I’m closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted students. Answers to frequently asked questions for waitlisted students can be found here, with more information about next steps to come in early April.!#@p!#@Congratulations to the Class of 2029, and best wishes to all of our applicants. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-regular-action-decisions-now-available-online-2025/

Out and about in the fog at the edge of the world by Uzay G. '26,,by Uzay G. '26,"March 13, 2025","I like standing at the edge, stopping there and looking down at the valley till my breath comes back. Feeling the world come to life. Seeing the raw scale of man fill my view only when I choose to see it. Seeing the world always, overwhelming with its color. Do you feel in your bones that insane color jumping off the cyan water trickling down the peak or the sun beating down your temples as you run up against it?!#@p!#@I’ve been standing at the edge a lot recently. Or maybe it always seems that way but just in different hues. I’ve been traveling for the last month around the world – it’s been ethereal and intense and beautiful. And now I just started an exchange back in Paris.!#@p!#@It’s a moment of cultural reckoning, 3 months to settle back and see what it’s like being here and meeting other young people doing similar stuff as an actual student. When I chose to go to MIT 3 years ago, I made a choice. And then I kept making choices over and over. And sometimes I would look at myself in the mirror and wonder: is this who I am?!#@p!#@Sometimes an old woman says that life is like a leaf in a stormy void. It floats against the shape of the world, makes some jumps and not some others, finds itself somewhere else, and keeps going, and someday you wake up and look around and hopefully know where you are. Maybe soaked and shriveled or plunged in dirt or laying your life down in the sunlight of a suburb. I chose to do this exchange, because I wanted to jump back up in the sky and say, no! I can’t let go let me see all the leaves rolling in the wind, I don’t know where I will land yet!!!!#@p!#@Last month I chose to teach some people math & ML & talk about dreams in the face of a moonlight mountain while drinking tea. And I chose to go to a city nearby and taste that heavenly sweet potato with the sesame paste on top. For a few hours I felt the city move and I followed its slanted curve and talked to some of its people and they told me about their worries and we shared something at the top of an abnormally large tower looking down on the world, an edge jutting out into the sky, nestled between forest and concrete.  I felt raw beauty in this place I would probably never come back to again, if there is one to come back to.!#@p!#@Then I went to a nearby land that I like and I walked around a lot. I walked and thought and looked and stood at the edge and listened. I chose to walk alone and listen to the sound of silence, and I chose to splice work in my moments of exploration, like the fictional man who brings a tupperware of salad to pepper into his burger everytime he goes to MacDonalds. I ate good food again, and went to a hot spring where I felt the ecstasy of hot water and then cold, over and over, next to the mountains. At another urban hot spring I met people from many different lands, and we spoke of those boundaries and then of the cracks that we felt comfortable enough to let slip through them. But then again I left and chose to be alone and turn right when it felt right, jump into life and run throughout the city, or go climbing, or try every different dessert in the convenience store.!#@p!#@Finally I went to another land, another edge of this universe, and stared the machine that burst through the city day after day in the eyes. I felt its metallic taste in my mouth and I mostly liked it. This time I chose to be with friends, of which many choose to live in the machine. But I mostly went around with those who I was there to work with, mostly just having the time to eke out a few spare sparks of metal from the rest (but in due time). So again I walked across the city on my worn feet, and we got to open a box full of more lives, but this time they went backwards rather than forward. They unraveled like thread under our hands as we went through them like TV episodes, replaying their trajectory and imagining what it would be like to fly the same course.!#@p!#@We learned a lot. We imagined ourselves in machines of all kinds and colors. But we also felt this nudging tingle that maybe the world could let us fly without metal, our bare skin slowly slipping against the shape of the world and holding on just because. We went up some trees, and looked down on this valley again. What a place. We chose to work till the lack of sleep made us stupid, and then we said that if we succeeded we would go up a mountain. We failed, but it was close. So it goes.!#@p!#@We felt the insane energy of a world writhing into neat shape, a 1000 doors suddenly opening and not enough time to look through all of them. The raw excitement at seeing that really you are the one driving. So what will you do? When the storm calms and suddenly the void is yours to cut through like a block of stone waiting to be made what will you slice? and then what will stare back at you when the dust settles down?!#@p!#@Being in control is a funny thing. There is a mountain to climb and a cliff to fall off of and at the end of the day you need to stick the landing. I think being in control is something I value a lot. I hold on to the wind like I can’t let go and hold and hold and push it left and right until it finally pushes me where I belong. Like a child holding on to his toys for too long. But even so I would not say I am a very controlled person. Sometimes I see a peak from afar and as I go up along the crests I choose to fall to the side through translucent glass which I go against and I break it with my hands and then I fall onto one leg awkwardly, trying to catch myself, and I think wow yeah I was in control and I knew what I was doing and now I can see the rainbow glowing through the mountain but my hands are bleeding.!#@p!#@Why try to take stock of the course you might take when you can simply sway back and let the world astonish you with its color? An old woman told me that sometimes you can hold onto an egg so hard your hands go white and it shell cracks all over your skin. But sometimes, when you finally let go and look down onto it, there is an eye staring back at you and you feel the miracle of the egg and the world it hides.!#@p!#@But most of the time you just lost it all because you couldn’t bring yourself to eat the egg in your hands while you could have. Because you couldn’t just close your eyes and open your mouth and let the warmth gladly flow through. It can be hard to know when to stop and sit on some rock of the mountain and pull out your sandwich and stare onto the green.!#@p!#@Maybe I want to hold on because I lack control where it matters. Have you ever heard the myth of Arjuna and the bird from the Mahabharata?  Maybe I would like that level of control:!#@p!#@Dronacharya gave a test to his students. He showed them the bird and said, what do you see? One by one they said the bird, the leaves, the trees, the people around, etc… And then he asked Arjuna: what do you see? And Arjuna looked onto the bird and the storm calmed and the leaf stopped its course and his breath shortened and for a moment he stood at the edge and the world shrunk until there was no longer such a thing as an edge and he saw what the bird was and he said: I see its eyes, only its eyes, like a vivid point calling out to me in a sea of nothing. And then his limbs moved of their own accord and he drew his arrow and shot it straight into its eyes.!#@p!#@For Arjuna the question of control and trajectory and choice and energy dissolve into the simple reality that there is just one world like a blue dot there in front of you and all your life wind has been pushing you straight forward and your legs are walking forwards and your eyes are staring down the path and all you see is the eyes of the bird waiting for you to look into them and there is no notion of control or you and your shape hitting against the world there is simply the motion of life slipping from one moment to the next in fundamentally the only way that could ever make sense.!#@p!#@Arjuna stands on the edge and knows he will not fall, because there is simply no world in which he ever could. He is here to stand there. This is what he is made for. He is here to breathe the mountain air and he is here to look down at the valley once again and see the bird waiting for him miles away, and then to reach for it. Maybe there is something here that is beyond control.!#@p!#@Maybe this is peace.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/out-and-about-in-the-fog-at-the-edge-of-the-world/
Taking the L: Part ✌️ by Kayode D. '27,My goal was Heaven anyways.,by Kayode D. '27,"March 13, 2025","[i think i need to drop another class]!#@p!#@Hey gang, it’s your favorite failure, back to fail a little bit more!!#@p!#@I think that the weather has a significant impact on my mood. This week has been abnormally warm, up in the fifties, and it’s the most positive and happy I’ve been in weeks. I thought that this was just some psychological thing that people talk about happening to OTHER people, but no, it truly got to me. Now I’m feeling good, and want to blog a bunch! Maybe I have a seasonal writer’s block…!#@p!#@This semester I’m taking four classes: 2.007, 2.086, 6.1010, and 21.01.!#@p!#@2.007 – Design and Manufacturing I!#@p!#@If you’ve ever done First Lego League of First Robotics, then you’ve taken part in a piece of MIT history. First Robotics was started by Woody Flowers, who was the first instructor of 2.007. This class is like the origin of everything engineering that I did in middle school. I loved lego robotics, and my mom can testify that I would stay after school literally every single day to build and work on the robotics board.!#@p!#@The theme for this year is “Wicked FBD: Applying Gravity”, and the board is Wicked themed. There’s a poppy field in munchkin land, a train that goes to Oz, and a giant Oz head in the middle of the board that can multiply your point totals. The biggest challenge, though, is to retrieve the broomstick from the highest point on the map.!#@p!#@This class is known to be a massive time commitment. On top of building and testing and refining your robot, there are also three homework assignments a week to keep up with. I did not do a very good job of keeping up with them in the beginning, and I am paying for that now. 😬!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-134652-800x578.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Board.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Last-Year.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Arm-and-such.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Hydra-Head.jpg]!#@A great blog from Petey that shows more footage of the class!!#@p!#@2.086 Numerical Computation for Mechanical Engineers!#@p!#@2.086 is a class that focuses on how to use Matlab. We work through different algorithms and processes and code up solutions to some intense problems. It’s honestly my least committed class, and so I do the poorest in it and enjoy it the least. The very first pset, I waited until 8pm the night before it was due, literally the night of the SUPER BOWL⁠01 . And I had never used Matlab before, but somehow I thought that my plot armor would help me power through it in one night with no help. I got 5% on that assignment.!#@p!#@They also have these interviews. You, the professor, and some other staff. One question, 5 minutes. The goal is to prove that you’ve been doing the homework and understand it. The question is specific enough that you’d only know the answer if you actually did all of the work, and there are unlimited retakes if you fail. But you HAVE to show up on time, or you forfeit the points. Guess what I did?!#@p!#@I set my interview for 10:45 AM on Tuesday, and I woke up at 10:45a AM on Tuesday. I woke up freaking out, I changed fast, woke up my roommate by accident, borrowed his bike⁠02 , and got to the office on the fourth floor of building 4 for the interview at 10:52. Seven minutes late. I was totally out of breath and asked if there was any way I could still be interviewed. They were strict, but fair, and did not allow me to take the interview, and I had to forfeit the points. I just sat outside the office completely defeated and lost. How could I have let this happen? Where had I gone wrong? This L was a punch to the gut.!#@p!#@6.1010 Fundamentals of Programming!#@p!#@6.1010 is known to be one the hardest coding classes among students. It’s a lot more intense and involved than 6.100L, and it builds in difficulty with each pset. So far, we’ve been modifying audio and image files with code, which created this masterpiece they showed in lab:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LeSunshine-scaled-e1741888735760-400x500.jpg]!#@I really enjoyed the first few assignments, but I did not give myself enough time to finish them. Every Thursday night I am up until 3 or 4 in the morning coding. I was debugging one section of code that kept returning errors, and the issue was a SINGLE PIXEL IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER. The fringest of fringe cases. Grrr.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@I thought that all of this seemed like a good course load when I signed up for it. Apparently it was not. I have not turned in a single pset this entire semester that was both on time and completed. I’ve been averaging 70% on all of my assignments. And I know that I could do better. I’m really excited about⁠03 my classes, and I want to do well in them.!#@p!#@I had a talk with my instructor in 2.007 recently that didn’t go the best. He told me that he knows I can do good work, he’s seen it. And he doesn’t need to know what’s going on in my life to be taking up my time, but if I want to be successful, I have to start committing more time to my work. Not cramming and powering through everything in one night, but intentionally working to get caught up and do well in the class.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@I reached a point one night where I felt so defeated. I had so much work to do, so many Psets and readings and labs to do, and certainly not enough time to do them all. I could feel myself slipping away. In defeat, I looked at my phone and saw a message in a Cru group chat sharing that there would be a spontaneously planned prayer and worship in the CFL⁠04 that night at 8. It was 7:30. I had so much work to do. I had every reason and then some to say that I was too busy. But I knew that this was literally too much for me to take. I packed up and headed over.!#@p!#@It was what I needed. I remember what got through me the most was the song “Make Room” by Community Music. The lyrics says “!#@p!#@Here is where I lay it down!#@p!#@Every burden, every crown!#@p!#@This is my surrender!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@And I will make room for You!#@p!#@To do whatever You want to!#@p!#@To do whatever You want to!#@p!#@… ”!#@p!#@I realized that I was holding on too tightly. I wasn’t making room for God. In my scheduling and in my day, I only ever prayed/read my bible in the morning or at night, when I was extremely tired. I wasn’t making time to rest or spend real time with God. And even more than that, I wasn’t making room for God to work spontaneously in my life. I was so pressed for time constantly, and I didn’t even have time to be with my friends or spend time with people. I felt like a zombie that wasn’t very good at being a zombie.!#@p!#@I needed to make a change. Something has to go. I decided to drop 6.101. At first, I didn’t want to drop anything. I’m only in four classes, which is for the most part the standard number to be taking in a semester. To drop to three would not set me behind for graduating, and I don’t even necessarily need 6.101 for course 2A6. I am just so in my own head that this is the way it has to be because this is the way that I’ve seen it done, and to quit or back out is to show weakness.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@The other day, a professor of mine mentioned that they read and enjoyed my first “Taking the L” blog, and so I went back and read it. Reading it, I realized that 1. It’s a fire blog and 2. I should take my own advice. Dropping a class or dropping to a lower level is not failure, and even if it is, that isn’t a bad thing. Failure is not the opposite of success, but a step towards it. You learn to appreciate the fruit of success from the lessons of failure. And you only really fail when you give up. I literally wrote that.!#@p!#@And now I feel so much better, you have no idea. I can actually work on all of my homework, and I can focus my time to get stuff done before two in the morning.!#@p!#@My point with this blog is this: You don’t have to do a morbillion things to be successful. You don’t have to do what everyone else is doing. You don’t have to get 100% on every single assignment you’ve ever done in your entire life. Life goes on.!#@p!#@And you need to rest. Even God, maker of Heaven and Earth, rested after making all of creation. But if he really is as powerful as he says, why does he need to rest? Because he was setting an example for us. So make room for rest.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@I started writing this blog at around 5pm⁠05 . It is now 9pm before the 6.101 pset is due. I planned to still finish this pset in the event that I end up actually sticking with the class, since I have enjoy it and maybe there is a way. But looking at the work I have ahead and all the other work I have, I truly didn’t think it was possible. So I began to pray. I prayed “God, I want to take this class. But I don’t see any way to keep going. I have so much to do, and I don’t have anything else that I could give up and keep my sanity other than this class. I just need help. I don’t know what to do.” and literally AS I’M PRAYING THIS, I get an email. It’s from the 2.086 Professor. And he’s asking if I am free tomorrow afternoon to do the interview.!#@p!#@The Lord is good. In our waiting He is working, whether we see it or not.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-13-134652-800x578.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Board.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Last-Year.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Arm-and-such.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2.007-Hydra-Head.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LeSunshine-scaled-e1741888735760-400x500.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/taking-the-l-part-%e2%9c%8c%ef%b8%8f/
meet the simmons elevators! by Ellie F. '28,aka me thinking wayyy too much about elevators,by Ellie F. '28,"March 12, 2025","Things always seem to come in threes. The Three Musketeers. The Holy Trinity. Rock, Paper, Scissors. The Plastics. And for Simmons Hall, our three elevators, Alevator, Belevator, and Celevator, each named for the tower it calls home.!#@p!#@MIT Wifi doesn’t work in the elevators, so whenever I’m in one, I have no choice but to ponder the machine surrounding me. All three elevators have a board full of posters, and the floor selection buttons that don’t always light up, and they all make a confusing series of dings whenever they open, but, like the distinct colors of their ceiling lights, they have very different personalities.!#@p!#@Alevator is sweet as can be, and as the farthest elevator from the entrance of Simmons, no one ever uses her. That means that whenever you call her, you can hear her whir to life and go straight to you like a personal chauffeur. I have never felt more important in my life. Alevator is a golden retriever in mechanical box form and if she was a real person I think our friendship would be a bit toxic and codependent <3 Needless to say, she’s my favorite.!#@p!#@Belevator is probably our most well-known elevator. Belevator lands right outside the dining hall, and generally serves the widest range of Simmons, so he’s constantly on the run. The first time I tried to take Belevator, it took over three minutes of creaking and groaning for him to arrive. He breaks down on a regular basis, much like MIT students during midterms season. In fact, he is so reliably unreliable that the Simmons Discord server has a channel dedicated to warning people when he’s out of service. We also have Belevator Down hoodies prominently displayed among campus fashion.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-0-800x1109.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-1-800x1017.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-2.png]!#@Celevator is my home elevator as a resident of C Tower. She’s the first elevator you see as you enter Simmons, and as such, is quite popular. Even though she’s pretty busy, she rarely breaks down. You always seem to be sharing the elevator with a stranger in awkward silence, and Celevator also has a strange habit of going all the way to the first floor, pausing, and then actually going to the floor you selected.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-0-800x1109.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-1-800x1017.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/belevator-2.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/meet-the-simmons-elevators/
Eating Studio Ghibli Foods 🌾 by Fiona L. '27,At a mini-restaurant pop-up by MINCE <3,by Fiona L. '27,"March 11, 2025","At the start of this month, I had the chance to eat at a Studio Ghibli themed pop-up restaurant, organized by MIT MINCE ⁠01 . As a big Studio Ghibli fan with an ever-growing collection of Totoro themed objects, I was extremely excited when I heard about the upcoming pop-up from Gilford T ’26, one of the club’s new members. I’d only been to one MINCE pop-up before (Lunar New Year themed, in the McCormick Green Room!), but I felt like this opportunity couldn’t be passed up.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-6.19.42-PM-1400x685.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-6.32.34-PM-1400x873.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5D5poTfNTlq-ZboFl338Dw-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-4.42.41-PM-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-4.53.01-PM-1400x1051.png]!#@(On a side note, it’s always nice to discover new “hidden spaces” around campus. I feel like no matter how many years one spends at MIT, there are always new rooms, new lounges, and new hidden crannies waiting to be discovered.)!#@p!#@I took the opportunity to bring every single Totoro-themed item I had: a Totoro tote bag, a Totoro cardigan, a Totoro hairclip, and two Totoro plushies. (There were even more items that I unfortunately had to leave at home.)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/yklRgYNkTt62T3EZmUx63w-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kpVXsBF2TDq5S_yFdA-FOQ-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WOS-VwwhTpKv3JankHd_7A-800x1066.jpg]!#@There was an option to enter the lottery as one or two people, although I didn’t have the time to ask somebody else to come with me, since I filled out the form last minute (😭). However, whether you come with a friend or not, you’ll still get the opportunity to meet new people at the pop-up—seating arrangements are randomly decided. At this particular pop-up, I got the opportunity to get to know Vivian H ’25, Jessica X ’24 MEng ’25, and Abrianna Z ’28. We were all different class years, but throughout the dinner, we bonded over enjoying the food and sharing our love for Ghibli films!!#@p!#@Now, onto the part that you’ve probably been waiting for: the food! Members of MINCE came from downstairs to bring each dish, so it really felt like we were at a restaurant. The food was as pretty as it was tasty. I used up a lot of self restraint taking pictures of each dish before digging in. 04 After each dish had been served, the people who had created each recipe talked about their ideas for the dish, and the process of creating it.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/i70JKpmsTLGZ5Y1y3jBCdg-1000x1333.jpg]!#@Blue Curaçao, coconut extract, lemon-lime soda.!#@p!#@My Rating: 7.5/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jFO8q1AAQEK-uxitEKSTWQ-1000x1333.jpg]!#@The drink was delicious! Fizzy, a little sweet, and really, really pretty. If you search up “anime water,” you’ll see exactly what this drink reminded me of. I wish water in real life could look like this ;-;!#@p!#@I finished the drink very quickly, as I usually do, and found that there was one, long cylinder of ice left behind. I battled with that piece of ice as I tried to retrieve the leftover pieces of blue jelly from the bottom of the tall glass.!#@p!#@Kavring cat rolls, herring biscuits, and baguettes with a butter flight: ube, black garlic, and tomato chili.!#@p!#@My Rating: 9/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BnMD_PqAQMqOQXJEIctalg-1400x1050.jpg]!#@The most challenging parts of eating this, for me, was finding a way to split each bread⁠06 and trying not to double-dip in the butter. Each of the dips was so good, carefully balancing between “too much” and “not enough” flavor. I also liked how different and high-quality each type of bread was, especially given that they were all homemade.!#@p!#@I had eaten so much bread that I felt like I wouldn’t have any room for the rest of the menu, but I would soon find myself surprised by my own abilities.!#@p!#@Salmon & black sesame onigiri, butterfly pea & sweet potato onigiri, and coconut mango onigiri, served with broccolini purée.!#@p!#@My Rating: 5/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7qIFIgtHQMejpAqW8CV0GQ-1000x1333.jpg]!#@Mixed feelings on the Totoro rice balls: I absolutely LOVED seeing them. I felt that creating 30*3 different Totoros would’ve taken so much time and effort, plus they turned out so adorable. I loved the reference to my favorite Ghibli movie of all time, which I’ve indoctrinated my entire family and my friends from home into watching.!#@p!#@I asked the others at my table what order I should eat the Totoros in: big to small, or small to big? They suggested I eat them from from big to small⁠07 , and I took a big bite into a Totoro filled with salmon. Although I usually really hate salmon, this salmon was okay! My favorite was medium Totoro, which was filled with sweet potato.!#@p!#@Shakshuka-baked egg, fondant potatoes, and cripsy pork belly served with a black garlic-romesco sauce.!#@p!#@My Rating: 9/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MNJX0eiVS-eH95-Rr9MocQ-1000x1333.jpg]!#@The main course was delicious! Both sauces were also similarly delicious, and I found that the fancy way of spreading them over the plate made them easier to dip into. I had no idea how they managed to “bake” the egg, but I thought it was delicious! I’d never eaten an egg like that in my life. The pork belly was also a great mix of soft fat and crispy skin.!#@p!#@Yuzu tofu pudding, lavender raindrop cake, crowned with blue caramel shards.!#@p!#@My Rating: 8/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Xfw8SCSaTru80-zz0mRrFA-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HsEa_AFfT7WHLfiienW-Ng.jpg]!#@Out of every dish, this was definitely the one where I spent the most time taking pictures. There was hardened caramel on top of each cake with a delicate, ornate design. I had no idea how it was made, but I really want to find out.!#@p!#@I didn’t know what a “palette cleanser” was before this, but I’d figure it would be like what this dish was for me—a small dish with a neutral taste, eaten before dessert.!#@p!#@Black cocoa cream puff with black sesame cream and red bean mochi, served with raspberry purée.!#@p!#@My Rating: 7/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xFpaKwR7RK2dCOD3AbWt4A-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fd33IQlWRpCpt6AHcsVL5A-800x1066.jpg]!#@The dessert was so cute! Almost too cute to eat. Almost. And fortunately, not too sweet either. The texture of the cream puff was nice, and the soot sprites came with multi-colored meringue stars that were very fun to eat.!#@p!#@Overall, I had an amazing time! The venue was set up beautifully, and all the food was really good. As a bonus, I got to discover a new part of a building that I rarely have the chance to go into. As somebody who loves meeting new people randomly and eating good food, I’ll hopefully find my way into more MINCE pop-ups soon :^)!#@p!#@A final note: if you’ve never seen screenshots of Ghibli food before, then you’re missing out!!! All the food in their movies looks so life-like and delicious, and I’m glad that this pop-up lived up to that aspect of its Ghibli inspirations.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/b0416f0349cf1c13b5bf81c9fcddc82a-1960968558-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/df303d75311ef917daa98b57d4af080c-2469145762-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1617709443362-bento-studio-ghibli-556038100-800x450.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/egg-over-toast-laputa-castle-in-the-sky-1635873185513-2730065773-800x366.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__2020__07__20200715-studio-ghibli-Ponyo_Ramen-2deccc3fadcb406db06d660885e6ac87-2972771023-800x431.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-6.19.42-PM-1400x685.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-6.32.34-PM-1400x873.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5D5poTfNTlq-ZboFl338Dw-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-4.42.41-PM-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-4.53.01-PM-1400x1051.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/yklRgYNkTt62T3EZmUx63w-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kpVXsBF2TDq5S_yFdA-FOQ-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WOS-VwwhTpKv3JankHd_7A-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/i70JKpmsTLGZ5Y1y3jBCdg-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jFO8q1AAQEK-uxitEKSTWQ-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BnMD_PqAQMqOQXJEIctalg-1400x1050.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7qIFIgtHQMejpAqW8CV0GQ-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MNJX0eiVS-eH95-Rr9MocQ-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Xfw8SCSaTru80-zz0mRrFA-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HsEa_AFfT7WHLfiienW-Ng.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xFpaKwR7RK2dCOD3AbWt4A-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fd33IQlWRpCpt6AHcsVL5A-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/b0416f0349cf1c13b5bf81c9fcddc82a-1960968558-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/df303d75311ef917daa98b57d4af080c-2469145762-800x450.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1617709443362-bento-studio-ghibli-556038100-800x450.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/egg-over-toast-laputa-castle-in-the-sky-1635873185513-2730065773-800x366.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__serious_eats__seriouseats.com__2020__07__20200715-studio-ghibli-Ponyo_Ramen-2deccc3fadcb406db06d660885e6ac87-2972771023-800x431.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/eating-studio-ghibli-foods-%f0%9f%8c%be/
"What is engineering, anyways? by Emiko P. '25",i promise it's more than just math,by Emiko P. '25,"March 10, 2025","I came to MIT certain of one thing: I would never be an engineer.!#@p!#@In eighth grade, everyone in my grade took a mandatory woodworking class. Even though the class was three months long, the only thing I can remember was the frustration of attempting engineering drawings. We would draw boxes and parts from three different angles – and I would always turn in my paper covered in layers of faded pencil marks as I erased and redrew, erased and redrew, over and over again. I remember taking a ruler to add measurements to my drawings, squinting and counting the lines on the ruler, messing up, then starting all over again. I was frustrated by the meticulous precision – I wanted to shred all those stupid engineering drawings and go outside and start cutting wood.!#@p!#@While I did enjoy analytical things, activities involving precision didn’t come naturally to me. The cookies I baked never seem to come out tasting right and my chemistry experiments in high school would incur wild errors – and I would never know what I was doing wrong. I would try so hard to focus and pay attention and make things exact, but it just never seemed to work out.!#@p!#@By the time I had to choose a major at MIT my freshman year, I had come to believe that precision and meticulousness were the defining traits of a good engineer – qualities I most certainly didn’t see in myself. I knew I didn’t fit the mold, and, to be honest, I wasn’t even interested. You can therefore understand why majoring in mechanical engineering never crossed my mind.!#@p!#@Until it did.!#@p!#@At the end of my freshman year at MIT, I declared brain and cognitive sciences as my major for one simple reason: because it was cool, and studying something cool would make me happy. I spent that next summer in Madrid, Spain in a computational neuroscience lab. And while I had chosen that lab because it was cool – studying emotions and Alzheimer’s – I found myself feeling deeply bored and unsatisfied.!#@p!#@I found my mind wandering to new things – I wanted to do something that mattered, and for me, a lab project that I would only see the results of in 10 years didn’t fit the bill.!#@p!#@With my newly declared major suddenly scrapped, I embarked on some soul-searching and deep digging of MIT’s Course Catalog. I emerged from my search with a surprising decision, choosing to change my major to something I had ruled out since the very beginning: mechanical engineering.!#@p!#@In my desperation to find my path forward after brain and cognitive sciences abruptly lost its magic, every option was back on the table. This time, I guided my decision-making process by asking myself what my core values are. I decided that these were creativity, collaboration, and impact. With those three things, I knew I would be happy, and I kept them in mind as I went back to the drawing board for a new major.!#@p!#@I had always been interested in physics, mostly because of cool space applications. The idea of black holes and dark energy and time travel all seemed so cool, and physics seemed like the lens through which I could study such fascinating topics. And I would be happy! But my time in my lab in Madrid bothered me because of impact. I wanted to do something, and the result of physics felt a little too close to brain and cognitive sciences: studying something because it was cool, not because I would be able to do anything tangible with it. And before anyone says anything, of course physics is amazing, and many people can do great things with it that will change our world forever. Perhaps understanding the physics of the world and of our brains is the most important thing we can do as humans. But I… didn’t want to do that. I needed something else.!#@p!#@So, what else fit the bill? Well, I turned to the idea of creativity: What about science journalism or policy? I was definitely drawn to these. Their magnetic pull was steering my hand to my computer mouse, filling out the change of major form, and guiding my imagination through a life where I was pursuing these things. And I would be happy.!#@p!#@But something stopped me.!#@p!#@For goodness sakes, something stopped me, because that wasn’t a good enough reason anymore. Happy wasn’t good enough anymore. If I took classes because they made me happy, then I wouldn’t take anything hard. And if I didn’t take anything hard, then how the heck was I going to learn anything at all? And that scared the crap out of me – the idea of coming to MIT and not learning anything? The idea of being surrounded by brilliant minds and taking the easy road just so I could stay happy? That didn’t sound like happiness at all. In fact, the idea made me distinctly unhappy.!#@p!#@So, I took a look at it again: the one major I never let myself think about, because it made me unhappy – or maybe I should say uncomfortable. Mechanical engineering was uncomfortable. Deeply so, because I didn’t truly know anything about it besides that it involved precision and some sort of deep-rooted love for Legos that I wasn’t born with.!#@p!#@I could hear my eighth-grade self screaming, watching in horror as I started tromping down the path towards engineering drawings and precision and everything I had assumed I hated. But I had a sneaking suspicion telling me that engineering had more in store for me than that.!#@p!#@Because as I continued thinking about creativity, collaboration, and impact… it dawned on me that mechanical engineering had all three. Everywhere I looked within the field, engineers were working together in teams to solve novel problems and change the world. Maybe everything I was looking for was waiting for me in the mechanical engineering department.!#@p!#@The idea began to grow on me. I began to imagine a world in which I graduated from MIT as a mechanical engineer. I began to imagine a world in which I chose classes and my major not because they would make me “happy” but because they would challenge me and force me to truly, deeply learn.!#@p!#@Before I knew it, I was talking with the academic advisor of the department, explaining my pros and cons list for why I should switch my major to mechanical engineering. I explained to her my fears – I had been certain I’d never be an engineer.!#@p!#@The first thing she said was: “Well, a pros and cons list is a very engineering thing to do.”!#@p!#@I filled out the change of major form the very next day.!#@p!#@As you may have guessed, the decision to major in mechanical engineering ended up being a great one for me. Over the course of my three years as a mechanical engineering student, I have realized that the qualities of a good engineer are not only precision, math equation wizardry, and the love of things like Legos and Ikea, but other things as well. Other things that I discovered I remarkably have, such as my core values of creativity, collaboration, and impact.!#@p!#@Let’s start with creativity. Because my concentration within mechanical engineering is product development, I’ve gotten to create a lot of things. In most of my product development classes, you are presented with an amorphous problem that you are tasked with solving. It’s up to you what direction you want to take to solve it, and that’s something that really surprised me and began to unravel my initial impressions of engineering. Contrary to my initial impression that engineering must always be precise, I’ve encountered so much freedom in engineering. There are a million ways to solve the same problem, and your imagination and creativity is more of a superpower than your ability to measure things with a ruler.!#@p!#@For example, one of my first design classes required that we bring 15-foot-tall balloons to the ground. There are dozens of ways you can accomplish this task: you can pop the balloons, catch them in a net, knock them down with a tower, lasso them like Indiana Jones, or even suck all the air out of the room to create a vacuum (this idea was not approved).!#@p!#@This creativity can be expressed in any project: I’ve built my own robot that had functional detachable arms, I’ve designed waterproof casings for an asthma diagnosis device, I’ve coded line-following robots, I’ve designed litter picker-uppers, I’ve gone through the product design process of building a powered mask for wildland firefighters, and the list goes on.!#@p!#@And what’s even more special is that I didn’t have to do any of these projects alone. You are not expected to know how to build robots from scratch or how to code – but you are expected to collaborate and ask questions. Engineering is unique because working in teams is the norm, which makes it a very friendly and collaborative environment. Some of my favorite moments at MIT have been working with a team on a class project, brilliance sparking between us, and our idea snowballing as it becomes better and better.!#@p!#@Best of all, engineering allows you to solve real problems. The product we built in 2.009 is a powered respiratory system that could literally save firefighters’ lives. The product we built in D-Lab is an asthma diagnosis device that could be carried around in a backpack to rural parts of India that would otherwise not have access to respiratory tests. My summer internship two years ago was part of the race to build the world’s first commercial lunar lander. These things are real and they are epic and this is what engineering is.!#@p!#@As you can see, engineering isn’t only about building mechanical parts – it’s about artful problem-solving and working with others. It goes beyond making individual pieces, but to building systems where parts and processes work together seamlessly. It’s about building things for people that are needed and wanted. That’s the thing about mechanical engineering: it’s an organic, human-centric process.!#@p!#@And I’ve been talking a lot about mechanical engineering here, but these ideas apply to other disciplines of engineering like civil, biological, chemical, electrical, software, aerospace, environmental, industrial, materials, nuclear, and so on.!#@p!#@There are many ways you can be an engineer, and that’s why my favorite definition of engineering is: “the action of working artfully to bring something about.”!#@p!#@People choose the same path for a variety of reasons. Just because you and someone else are in the same major, but have wildly different reasons for being there, doesn’t mean that you don’t belong. Engineering can be a space for you, no matter what brings you there – whether it’s a love of math and precision, imagination and design, or something beyond.!#@p!#@So, if you’ve decided quickly and early that you are not something or will never consider something… maybe reevaluate. Maybe see if that quick rejection is hiding something deeper – maybe you’re like me, and your hate for eighth grade woodworking and failure at baking cookies doesn’t actually mean you wouldn’t like mechanical engineering. Because maybe you don’t even know what mechanical engineering really is, and you may be missing out on the adventure of a lifetime.!#@p!#@A few days ago, I got some really great news. I was interviewed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers last December, and this month they featured me in an article in their monthly Mechanical Engineering Magazine about collegiate athletes studying engineering. After all the hard work and self-discovery that occurred as I pursued this major, it was honestly so exciting to share my adventure in one of the most influential mechanical engineering magazines in the world.!#@p!#@And to think, I came to MIT vowing never to be an engineer. And to think, when I changed my major, I had thought with awe about the fact that in three years’ time, maybe I could become an engineer. Even though it would be hard, maybe I could do it.!#@p!#@And I did it!!#@p!#@But more importantly, you can, too! I’m telling you this story to show you two things: 1) engineering encompasses so much more than you may think, 2) the world is your oyster, and you can do this!!#@p!#@Do the hard thing, conquer the hard thing, and become an even better version of yourself in the process. And for those of you who don’t see your interests aligning with engineering at first, maybe take a second look :)!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-is-engineering-anyways/
"moving on, as shown through free t-shirts by Aiden H. '28",some spring cleaning,by Aiden H. '28,"March 10, 2025","I have never read any of Marie Kondo’s books, nor have I claimed to, but I feel like we’re connected on at least some minor spiritual level. Although it’s definitely some form of undiagnosed anxiety or minor mental health disorder I’ve always hated physical stuff. Even when I was a kid, I wanted my room to be as clean as possible, with everything straightened and as little stuff to trip over as possible. When we moved apartments freshman year of high school, I didn’t put up any decorations on my walls because I didn’t want to spend the money or feel cluttered/off-balance. The only things in my room were a bed, bookshelf, and keyboard. I kept it that way for four years.!#@p!#@This led to a bad habit of me pushing all the little things I actually had to keep but never wanted to look at (sentimental knick knacks, random notebooks and folders, maybe even my social security card) into my closet, which stayed in a state of constant chaos. Every opening⁠01 of the closet door instantly spiked my blood pressure levels. So in an effort of personal development, noticing how my college closet has been led to the same fate, I have decided on minor downsizing.!#@p!#@The issue is I don’t actually have that many clothes. I have maybe 4 pairs of pants and 6 shirts I can rotate for a max of like 8 outfits in any season. However, what I lack in day-clothes-I-would-actually-wear-outside I make up for with really-ugly-free-t-shirts-that-I-only-wear-to-bed-and-embarrassingly-to-the-bathroom-at-like-2-AM. In my most recent inventory, I have over 40 of these oddities, and they sit in a large, unkempt stack at the bottom of my closet that prevents me from putting anything else there.!#@p!#@Even though I cycle through these pretty regularly, when deciding what to keep and give away, I started thinking about the random scenarios I actually got these t-shirts. I decided to share some (but definitely not all) of the highlights, explain how I got them, and why/why not I’m keeping them.!#@p!#@Tie-Dye Regrets!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164422-800x628.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164539-800x822.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164458-800x820.jpg]!#@#1: At some point during deep COVID lockdown times, my friend and I rode our bikes to the closest Walmart and tie-dyed the largest shirts we could find. Although the result is minorly atrocious, it acts almost like a mumu and is objectively the best sleepwear.!#@p!#@Fun Fact: This shirt is so large that even a .5x wasn’t zoomed out enough for me to get it all on my camera.!#@p!#@#2/3: These are two years of shirts from the same club: Sources of Strength. It was branded as the school’s mental health awareness club, but since Gen-Z mental health is an issue that no amount of an unfunded high school club can fix, we didn’t do a lot other than sit around and talk about our feelings at lunch. Once a year, though, we designed our t-shirt. Junior year, this was us all deciding on a mountain range (because Colorado? I guess?). Senior year, that had us each draw a little thing that made us happy in a circle and then scanned it onto a t-shirt (I think I drew a piece of cake). Then, we were supposed to come in on a Saturday to tie-dye it as a group. I see many problems with this:!#@p!#@Verdicts: Keep 1, get rid of 2 and 3.!#@p!#@National Honor Society!#@p!#@This was the shirt for my junior year of NHS. It was the first year I was on the board, so I was mandated to wear this shirt twice a month in front of a group of dead-in-the-eyes peers in the gym at lunches. And honestly? Don’t hate it. We were going for a retro wave-ish vibe for no reason other than we decided on it, and it turned out as one of the most okay-ish looking free t-shirts I’ve ever got. Still not wearing it confidently when I want a good outfit, but not actively ugly.!#@p!#@I also wore this shirt once where I ran a community service event for the club where we partnered with the local Parks Department to plant trees for Arbor Day. I shall keep this shirt in honor of Albert (the tree).!#@p!#@Verdict: Keep 🌲!#@p!#@Speech and Debate!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164050-800x803.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164121-800x768.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164148-800x851.jpg]!#@This is the three-year progression⁠02 of t-shirts I got at the national speech and debate tournament.!#@p!#@#1: This was the summer after freshman year, aka deep COVID. Because of this, instead of traveling to a location, my team went into my coach’s parent’s basement that we took over for a week with dozens of muffins and floor naps and hours of pinball on their pinball machine. I didn’t do great though and the shirt is the oldest and frumpiest.!#@p!#@#2: This was the first in-person year in Louisville, KY. We stayed in a Victorian-mansion-turned-Airbnb and got an arguably cuter color for the t-shirt. Over the course of the week, all I remember about competition is early-morning humidity and one guy telling me “not to hold my breath until my argument came true”, but KY itself was nice. We got yelled at for trying to go on the roof of the mansion and later went on an (awful, hot, long, but camp) ghost tour of Louisville houses. When I got this shirt I really liked it, but after years of wearing it, by lethally acidic face wash has bleached parts of it, and repeated washes have made the shirt very dry and scratchy.!#@p!#@#3: Similar to KY, Phoenix is nothing more memorable than “hot”. This was the year I did best, and we did have a pool at the VRBO we stayed in, so most of my memories are us destroying ping-pong and the pool. It was also the year that the Nuggets won the NBA finals, so we watched the final game and screamed. This shirt is also a little dry and over-worn (seems like the NSDA needs a higher shirt budget), but it has the cutest logo because it was the first year they decided on a mascot for the tournament (Prickles, cause Arizona yk). It also has the most recent memories attached to it.!#@p!#@Verdict: Keep 3, get rid of 1 and 2. It feels weird to get older and older and keep all of them. I don’t want to be like 25 with 3 of basically the same shirt from a high school extracurricular.!#@p!#@Music?!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250308_175657-800x814.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164001-800x781.jpg]!#@#1: I dislike Guns N Roses to a fairly extreme extent. I don’t like dad rock, don’t think Axl Rose can still sing, and they don’t really have that many generationally-spanning hits that could put them in the same echelon of importance as other old bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc. etc. All this being said, my friend’s parents last year were going to their reunion tour in Denver and asked (begged?) if I would go with him so he didn’t have to sit alone at Guns N Roses. Turns out that this was the longest concert ever known, and I sat through the Eras Tour and its movie. After an hour-long opener, Guns N Roses came out while graphics of what I think were fetuses or some sort of deranged anthropomorphic minions crawled frantically in a mass on screens around the stadium. Guns N Roses then proceeded to play what I could only imagine is their entire discography for a nearly 4 hour set. After nearly 5 hours in Ball Arena, we agreed to not go to a Guns N Roses concert ever again. For Christmas he got me this Guns N Roses shirt. I retaliated with off-brand Pit Vipers⁠03 . Because it’s an actual tour shirt, though, it’s shockingly high quality.!#@p!#@#2: As the only Britney Spears in my household (unfortunately), my mom jokingly got this shirt when she saw it at a Target. It is a large and I’m not that self-evolved, so I have never worn this except as pajamas. Regardless, it’s Britney Spears and I do wear the shirt.!#@p!#@Verdict: Keep both for the joke and the comfort.!#@p!#@Oversized Grandpa Shirts!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_163901-800x693.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_163709-800x807.jpg]!#@I own 3-4 of these shirts that are hand-me-downs from my girlfriend’s grandpa. I dug through a hamper of like 30 and picked out the funniest three or four. I need these to be physically documented and yes I wear these XXXLs around Maseeh obsessively. Sorry? Sorry? What do you mean I don’t look good in this Margaritaville shirt that goes down to my knees that I got from a 70 year old I met once?!#@p!#@Verdict: Keep both, duh!#@p!#@The Greatest T-Shirts of All Time!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_164228-800x757.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303_163809-800x809.jpg]!#@#1: I don’t even think I watched Sesame Street as a kid but the first time I saw this shirt I bursted out laughing harder than I ever have. I’m 99% sure it is available at most Walmarts, but the idea of me as the scrawniest nerd acting like a pimp because I watched PBS is hilarious, and the dad joke on the shirt will never get old.!#@p!#@Fun Fact: I have actually been gifted this shirt twice by two different people years apart. People just know me that well I guess.!#@p!#@#2: My libertarian (?) cousin passive aggressively/jokingly gave me this at my high school graduation, and despite how I kinda detest political paraphernalia⁠04 , I find the shirt just ironic enough that it’s kinda funny. I wear this shirt a lot in the summer because it’s the perfect amount of flowy without being baggy. I did get some stares from the geriatrics when I would go play pickleball though.!#@p!#@Verdict: Keep both.!#@p!#@That’s all. It doesn’t look like I gave up that many shirts, but I promise I am. It turns out that most shirts I’m willing to give away are just solid-toned t-shirts from Old Navy⁠05 I don’t remember ever buying. Let’s hope daylight savings today encourages even more spring cleaning (and fixes everything else that stems from the plague that is known as winter).!#@p!#@What’s the craziest t-shirt you own?

Bad Ideas events I went to (another late IAP post) by Anika H. '26,i can’t believe ellie beat me to the punch,by Anika H. '26,"March 8, 2025","IAP is one of my favorite times of the year, because it’s the best time to do stupid things at the canonical school of smart people with minimal consequences. And every year, we celebrate this fact with a whole weekend of absolute tomfoolery. With that said, I proudly present to you some of the dumb shit I participated in.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-6-1000x1333.jpg]!#@hot ones MIT edition – Bonfire, Random Hall!#@p!#@This was probably the one event I was most excited to go to. There were a lot of chicken, and also pages filled with integrals, in case you preferred mental pain instead of physical pain. It was free food, so I made my way up some floors to Bonfire to see, unsurprisingly, people eating chicken, chugging milk, and dying of heat in the middle of winter. I started on the medium spice, and it was pretty good. I ate one because I was hungry and felt like doing some integrals. And then I got bored, so I asked people what the worst one was, and they said it was a sauce called “Da Bomb”.!#@p!#@It can’t be that bad right? WRONG. My pride as an Asian with spice tolerance was shattered. I was fine for the first 3 seconds, so I took a few bites, though the sauce tasted weirdly bitter. And then it hit. It felt like I ate a mouthful of hot coals straight from the forge of Hephaestus himself. From then on, the spice got logarithmically worse, and I was fighting for my life in between gulps of milk. I gave up on finding cups and was chugging it straight from a bowl. That way, when I was not actively drinking, I could soak the lower half of my face in milk to feel less of the pain. I’m extremely glad that I’m not lactose intolerant, because if I was, the amount of milk I drank would have been a way bigger problem than the spicy chicken. By the end of the event, I was quite full— of mostly milk.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-2.jpg]!#@If you ever decide to try something like this, I would highly recommend drinking as much milk as you possibly can. Casein (a protein found in milk) binds to capsaicin (the spicy chemical), making it much more effective than water to wash out the spiciness. Remember, what goes in one end must come out the other. Unfortunately for us, our bodies don’t completely digest all the capsaicin we ingest. So if you somehow managed to tough out eating it without neutralizing any of the spice, you’re gonna have a hell of a time on the toilet in a few hours. (I didn’t, the milk works)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-1-400x269.jpg]!#@pronoun fight – AIW, Random Hall!#@p!#@In this fight, you are to bet your pronouns, or the letters of your name, or both. I wanted to bet my name so that I could go from being called Anika to being called Aia (aiya). I tried to lose letters, got too into it, and ended up with extra. The “fights” can be anything the two parties agree too, and can be anything from staring contests, to Super Smash Bros, to boxing. Basically, anything within reason.!#@p!#@The default fight is a wrestling match, and I was relatively decent at those, given that my opponent wasn’t too many weight classes above me. I wrestled some number of times, including one where I went with an arm behind my back because I was fighting a frosh who had no prior experience. Unfortunately for him, I ended that one pretty quick. I lost waterbottle flipping against Pablo and a round where I tried to kick a small target on someone who’s running away from me. By the end of the event, after watching many spectacular matches and dabbling in a few myself, I went from being Anika she/her/hers, to Aniaih she/her/hers/he. It wasn’t quite the result I hoped for, but it was really fun.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-3.jpg]!#@2^n dumplings – Next House Country Kitchen!#@p!#@While I was here for two hours, I didn’t actually end up eating all that many dumplings, because most of my time was spent hard carrying the wrapping station. I learned how to wrap them properly from my family (shoutout mom and grandma!), and have gone to this event every year since freshman year. We went through several packs of premade dumpling skins, and I showed new people how to make them as they came in. I don’t how much we ended up with, but I think it could have been anywhere from 2^7 to 2^9 dumplings.!#@p!#@cursed tiramisu – Burton Connor TV Lounge!#@p!#@More free food! Visitors were encouraged to take a lady finger (a type of biscuit), dip it in a mystery flavor, and then coat it in custard and cocoa powder. The flavor of tiramisu you got was chosen by the wheel of doom. There were some good options on it, like caffeinated chocolate, and some terrible ones like Spagetti-os and soy sauce. I was quite lucky for the most part given how many I ate, but got Spagetti-o’s once and decided to call it a day there because of how bad it was. I’m very very happy I didn’t get soy sauce. The few poor souls who got them looked like their taste buds were begging for mercy.!#@p!#@When I decided to take a break from tiramisu, I was in the corner learning how to play pool, which I soon learned that I absolutely suck at. I would often miss the ball right in front of me, but by some miracle, I managed to sink two balls in the holes in the span of an hour. Ryan also taught some of us how to play Gatas, where you would run around the table flinging the white cue ball at the 8-ball. I found this a lot more fun and a lot less challenging.!#@p!#@Some events that I briefly stopped by:!#@p!#@Dig Yer Own Grave!#@p!#@We weren’t allowed to dig the traditional 6 feet, but EHS did let us dig a 4 foot hole next to building 5, which I think is a pretty good compromise. I stopped by for a few minutes to help shovel rocks out the hole, but went back in because it was freezing and I left my jacket in a makerspace three buildings away.!#@p!#@Outdoor forge!#@p!#@I like bending hot glowy metal into funny shapes.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-5-400x300.jpg]!#@Rat Cake Competition!#@p!#@Lots of rat shaped cakes. Lots of good cake rats, but only one was crowned the king of rats.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-08-165429-400x299.png]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-6-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-2.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-1-400x269.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bad-ideas-5-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-08-165429-400x299.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/bad-ideas-events-i-went-to-another-late-iap-post/
I asked people at MIT what they were doing for Pi Day 2025 by Jebby B. '25,something is rising... 3/14/25 at 6:28 PM ET,by Jebby B. '25,"March 7, 2025","Pi Day is a big deal at MIT. Not only does it go hand-in-hand with the “nerd culture” that MIT is known for, but it’s also tradition to announce Regular Action decisions on Pi Day every year.!#@p!#@But, what exactly does Pi Day look like at MIT? Do students eat pie? Do people recite the digits of pi? Or maybe there’s a mysterious tradition that even I don’t know about.!#@p!#@So, I went around campus to get the scoop on how students and staff will be observing Pi Day 2025 — which, NASA tells me, is also a “blood moon” total lunar eclipse.!#@p!#@We chatted a little more about student life before they left for the Fest. As I walked down the Infinite Corridor, the 251-meter hallway that passes through the main campus, I noticed a prominent trail of BLOOD MOON FEST flyers lining the wall. There was so much enthusiasm radiating from the walls that I couldn’t help but follow the trail myself.!#@p!#@Even then, I underestimated how excited students were about this “Blood Moon Fest,” until I ran into three more students who were eagerly reading the signs outside.!#@p!#@The three students seemed to have completely forgotten I was there. Nellie and Beatrice wildly gesticulated at their notebooks while Gustav sent pleading eyes toward the heavens, as if hoping the Blood Moon would suddenly emerge to save him from the onslaught of mathematics of objects that were not, in fact, approximate as spheres.!#@p!#@I didn’t want to be late to the Blood Moon Fest, so I left these students to their debate and continued following the flyers.!#@p!#@I walked by labs filled with mysterious and important-looking equipment, and nearly got hit by a door as a professor exited her office. She was very kind, though. Turns out that we were both headed to Blood Moon Fest, so I was able to ask her a couple questions along the way.!#@p!#@Our conversation delved deeper into the crystal structure of “MOONstones” before we got sidetracked discussing the latest Severance episode.!#@p!#@Soon, we arrived at the Blood Moon Fest that I’d been hearing about all day! It was a modest, but endearing sight. Students came in all kinds of costumes, mingling and chatting. Someone’s Bluetooth speaker was blasting a WMBR-hosted cover of “Red Moon Supernova” (a spin on the Chappell Roan song). I was roped into a spontaneous conga line that was started by the Moon Institute of Technology Club, a small group of students who are passionate about establishing a sister campus for MIT on the moon.!#@p!#@Even though the “festival” resembled an elementary school fundraiser, the air buzzed with an energy that rivaled Coachella.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_07-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_05-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_06-800x533.jpg]!#@Suddenly, a student rushed towards the venue yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye! The Man in the Moon is here!” Behind them, no one other than Stu Schmill walked forward as the student presented him with a handmade Blood Moon costume.!#@p!#@As he stepped up on a platform, a hush fell over the small crowd.!#@p!#@Students were cheering and screaming. Frank and John got so excited that they started punching the ground.!#@p!#@To be completely honest, there was a part of me that expected Blood Moon Fest to be something arcane and mystical. But in the end, it was just normal people coming together to celebrate the little joys and nerdy coincidences in this corner of the universe.!#@p!#@I guess the real magic was the friends we made along the way.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_07-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_05-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BloodMoon_06-800x533.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/pi-day-2025-blood-moon/
"Birds Are Real, and So Is Quantum Physics by Andi Q. '25","Monkey see, monkey believe",by Andi Q. '25,"March 6, 2025","I believe in quantum physics now.!#@p!#@The past few weeks have changed the way I look at the world. Experiment after experiment has confirmed that quantum phenomena, as absurd as they seem, are real. And for once, I was able to see these phenomena with my own two eyes, in the flesh, because I was the one to perform the experiments!!#@p!#@I performed all these experiments in 6.2410 (Quantum Systems Engineering Lab) – a class I’m taking this semester to convince myself that quantum physics is real. 6.2410 is all about two things: demonstrating the fundamental properties of quantum particles and using those properties to engineer sensors that exceed “classical” (non-quantum) limits.!#@p!#@Most of the experiments in 6.2410 use quantum optics – think lasers, mirrors, and whatnot. Except instead of the $5 lasers and mirrors you can find on Amazon, we use the “Quantenkoffer” – a $500k quantum optics toolkit from Germany with nanometer-scale control over laser/mirror alignment.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0333.png]!#@It might sound like overkill, but it’s not. One of the most annoying things about working with quantum optics is that experiments are unbelievably sensitive to alignment, so even a tiny misalignment (e.g., from breathing too hard on your equipment) can throw off the entire system. (Ironically, this sensitivity is what makes quantum-enhanced sensing so useful in the first place.)!#@p!#@The Quantenkoffer handles most of this tricky alignment process for us and dramatically speeds up experiments. Instead of placing the optical components in “free space” (as in a traditional optics setup), there are fixed slots where the components snap into place like LEGO bricks⁠01 . It’s not perfect and we still spend an hour each lab session aligning everything, but the instructors told me each experiment we do in 6.2410 (around two hours each) can easily span an entire semester at other universities without the Quantenkoffer.!#@p!#@We’ve worked with four different quantum effects so far:!#@p!#@The fact that these effects are real at all was mindblowing. (If you’ve ever seen a video of a monkey reacting to a magic trick, that’s exactly how I felt during the experiments.) But even more mindblowing was that people have found ways to apply these effects to solve real-world engineering problems!!#@p!#@So bear with me as I attempt to tell you about these effects and what makes them so weird.!#@p!#@Quantum entanglement is when two particles are correlated in a way that measuring one immediately gives you information about the other, no matter where it is.!#@p!#@In 6.2410, entanglement primarily appears as polarization entanglement. Polarization is a property of light that, for simplicity, we can measure as an angle between 0° and 90°. The Quantenkoffer has a laser that generates two photons at a time that are polarization entangled, meaning they are always both 0° (horizontally) polarized or 90° (vertically) polarized. This sounds impossible – how can we control individual photons with such precision? – but we verified with cold, hard measurements that this was indeed the case.!#@p!#@I honestly still don’t know how entanglement works. It feels like it just… happens sometimes. But I think most people don’t understand how it works. Even Einstein didn’t believe in entanglement in his day, and the (recent) 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded “for experiments with entangled photons”.!#@p!#@Entangled particles are the basis of many quantum technologies today, such as:!#@p!#@This effect is a bit easier to explain than entanglement, but it is just as weird.!#@p!#@You may have heard that photons act as both particles and waves. Wave-particle duality doesn’t matter much for the amounts of light that humans typically interact with, but it has some bizarre implications when we go down to single photons.!#@p!#@Consider the following optical setup:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/T3E1-single-photon-interferometer-800x390.png]!#@You can think of 50/50 beamsplitters assigning incident photons randomly to one of two outputs. So if we treat the single photon as a particle, we’d expect the photon to exit at (d) or (e) equally as often.!#@p!#@But if we treat the single photon as a wave instead (and assume that the two possible paths through the system are equally long), the photon will always exit at (d). The wave interferes with itself at (e) and cancels itself out.!#@p!#@It turns out that the wave-like behavior is what happens in real life! If we send a stream of single photons through this system, then every single one will exit at (d), which we can measure.!#@p!#@This result was hard for me to accept because it just… doesn’t happen at macroscopic scales. Imagine if a restaurant has two main-course options (beef or chicken) and two dessert options (cake or pie), and every single person somehow chooses either {beef and cake} or {chicken and pie} and no other combination. It would be completely improbable, yet this is exactly what happens on the quantum scale.!#@p!#@Single-photon interference isn’t just a fun little quirk of physics; it also has many real-world applications that we constructed in the lab:!#@p!#@Two-photon interference is like single-photon interference but with – you guessed it – two photons! Instead of sending a single photon through two beamsplitters, this time we send two photons through a single beamsplitter.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep13947_Fig1_HTML.jpg]!#@In general (if the two photons are not identical or enter the beamsplitter at different times), nothing exciting happens. Each photon interacts independently with the beamsplitter, and there’s a 50/50 chance of whether they both exit through the same path.!#@p!#@But when the two photons are identical and enter the beamsplitter at exactly the same time, something truly astounding happens – they always exit through the same path. In other words, they become entangled in space!!#@p!#@Like single-photon interference, two-photon interference happens because photons are waves. Similarly, you can use the restaurant analogy to see why I thought this effect was so ridiculous until I actually observed it in the lab.!#@p!#@The main application of this effect (as far as I know) is to make better interferometers by exploiting the photons’ entanglement to make more precise distance measurements. LIGO used a similar technique to detect gravitational waves back in 2015.!#@p!#@This effect is, in my opinion, the strangest one because I still don’t quite understand it.!#@p!#@The gist is:!#@p!#@Ok, so what does any of this have to do with birds? Not much, to be honest, but I just wanted an excuse to talk about pigeons.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0299.png]!#@Pigeons are amazing creatures and have many talents (like drinking through suction, which surprisingly few other animals can do), but one of their most remarkable skills is navigation. Despite not having access to GPS technology, pigeons almost never get lost when flying home, even when home is hundreds of miles away. This skill is one of the reasons why pigeons are everywhere today – humans have used domesticated pigeons to communicate reliably over long distances as far back as ancient Egypt.!#@p!#@So how do they do it? The short answer is we still don’t quite know for certain. There are plenty of exotic theories out there, ranging from “pigeons can hear magnetic fields” to “pigeons can smell the way home”. Although these theories may well be true and contribute to pigeon navigation, the coolest and most compelling theory (in my opinion) is that pigeons can see magnetic fields, thanks to some special proteins in their eyes called “cryptochromes”.!#@p!#@Recent evidence suggests that cryptochromes work because of quantum entanglement and another exotic theory called the “quantum Zeno effect”⁠02 . When blue light hits a cryptochrome, it causes two electrons in the protein to become entangled. The interaction between these electrons and magnetic fields then affects how quickly the protein reacts with other chemicals in the eyes, translating into an optical signal in the brain.!#@p!#@Interestingly, cryptochromes are not specific to pigeons – all birds have them. However, we have also found that cryptochromes in pigeon eyes are much more sensitive to magnetic fields than those in chicken eyes (because chickens rely less on long-distance navigation). This evidence further supports the theory that cryptochromes (and by extension quantum entanglement) is mainly responsible for pigeons’ amazing navigational abilities.!#@p!#@All this to say that pigeons (and I suppose all birds) are quantum magnetic wonders, and we should all appreciate them more.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0333.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/T3E1-single-photon-interferometer-800x390.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep13947_Fig1_HTML.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0299.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/birds-are-real-and-so-is-quantum-physics/
GTL Kazakhstan  [IAP 2025] by Fiona L. '27,A January I won't forget,by Fiona L. '27,"March 6, 2025","My GTL⁠01 started with the warmest welcomes. On the very first day of the program, I walked through the front entrance of the Shoqan School and was serenaded by a melody played by the elementary schoolers on dombra⁠02 . They were all wearing traditional clothing, and seemed to have been eagerly waiting the arrival of me and Colin, a PhD student also teaching at Shoqan.!#@p!#@We went into the principal’s office to find a table filled with different Kazakh desserts, baursak⁠03 , qurt⁠04 , and fermented horse milk. The fermented horse milk seemed to be a hit or miss among travelers. While I didn’t enjoy the flavor, Colin drank his entire bowl in one gulp! Bakhadir, the principal of Shoqan, gave us a very warm welcome while introducing our roles at Shoqan.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bbgI9ES1Sryati1w5KVYpA-1400x1050.jpg]!#@The next day, on Friday, right near the entrance of the school was a table full of more Kazakh snacks. It turns out it was another one of the school’s unique traditions, alongside the national anthem playing every Monday and the students clapping when somebody dropped a plate in the dining hall. 05!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EzGjcUH8To2DoCO6L5Sezw.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ae94_lxwTwSGABDpxVXUkw-1000x1333.jpg]!#@Something I really appreciated about Shoqan was how patriotic the whole school was. Before starting GTL, my vision of private schools in foreign countries was that a lot of them were international schools in an American or British format. Sure, there were plenty of schools like that in Almaty⁠06 , but Shoqan stayed close to its Kazakh roots. The bell that sounded the end of each class was a traditional melody played on a dombra, and on a tour of the school, I discovered that the school library was built in the shape of a yurt⁠07 .!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sMtT_CgqSGeTYfwAgNJT0A-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JVcjGzniS0qT0e-7LUtoKA.jpg]!#@The curriculum of the classes adhered to the Kazakh “national curriculum,” and students were expected to know three languages—Russian, Kazakh, and English—by the time they graduated. Although I grew up bilingual, I was envious of the linguistic capabilities of the students at Shoqan. In high school, most American students study only 2-4 years of a foreign language (typically Spanish), while students in Kazakhstan studied all three of these languages from the time they first start school. When it came to foreign language, I felt like 2-4 years wasn’t enough to really retain information long-term.!#@p!#@The week after that was when my teaching really began. I was in charge of teaching classes ranging from English to Math to Physics to Chemistry.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cWvkMASYSCitocp8gCV1iA-1000x1333.jpg]!#@I enjoyed explaining the concepts and answering the students’ questions. I was surprised how subjects like AP Chemistry and AP Physics suddenly came back to me after years of not studying them. Teaching in another language was definitely a barrier—sometimes, the students would talk amongst themselves or ask the teacher a question in Russian or Kazakh. It felt… uncomfortable to not be able to understand them, even though I knew that they very likely weren’t talking about me.!#@p!#@During the first week, I confided in Arystanbek, a teacher who taught math from grade school up to AP Calculus, about how I felt.!#@p!#@“I explain something to them in English, and then they ask you in Russian and you explain the exact same thing in Russian.” I complained to him.!#@p!#@“And they still don’t listen to me,” he said, a hint of a smile in his eyes.!#@p!#@He added that if they weren’t listening, I shouldn’t be afraid to just tell them how I felt. His words felt strangely encouraging to me. Even as somebody who spoke the language, he knew that students could sometimes be unfocused.!#@p!#@Overall, I also got somewhat of a feeling that my day-to-day experience of teaching was wildly inconsistent. Some days, I had no trouble explaining everything, and some days I was simply “off my game.” Each class of students varied from focused and well behaved to rowdy and off-topic. Especially with the younger students, I felt that teaching was more about classroom management rather than explaining skills.!#@p!#@I think the real gem of the program 08 was all the people I got to meet.!#@p!#@I absolutely loved eating lunch with the students and hearing about all their different dreams. I enjoyed their immense interest in my life as an MIT undergrad, and in return, I was very interested in their lives in Kazakhstan. Most of the kids led busy lives and wanted to go abroad for college. Many wanted to come back in order to help Kazakhstan develop further. From Aldiyar, the president of the hiking club who loved collecting fossils; to Mardan; to Ayualym, who wanted to study chemistry and environmental science to help clear up Kazakhstan’s atmosphere, it was a privilege to learn about them, and the many other students I was able to talk to in just three weeks.!#@p!#@In turn, they had a lot of questions for me. Is it hard to study at MIT? How did you get into MIT? What is the best extracurricular I should be doing right now? How do you like Almaty? Have you tried horse meat? [My answers: hard but doable; i dont know :sob: ; whichever one you’re the most interested in; I really like Almaty; yes, it’s pretty good]!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0WtR3j8xTEuKcyVesGOmUg-1000x1333.jpg]!#@My coworkers⁠09 also had some interesting stories to share. One of the other college counselors was Robert, an American from Florida who had spent a lot of time working in Russia and Central Asia, and who was also proficient in 10 languages, including Russian and Kazakh.!#@p!#@One of my favorite stories of his was from his time working as an intern for the US Embassy in Cameroon. Somebody had requested a work visa to the US, showing an offer letter for a job at Verizon. To Robert, it looked legit, but his boss rejected it immediately. She later explained to him, taking him to the back office where she compared the offer letter with a bunch of other documents from the embassy. While the other documents were printed in the US, and had the US standard dimension 8.5×11, the offer letter had the global standard dimension A4. If it were a real offer letter from the US, it should’ve been printed in the US. The difference in the dimensions proved it wasn’t.!#@p!#@I was stunned after hearing this story. It convinced me that some people are really just special.!#@p!#@The last week of GTL was the best by far. Although I got sick unexpectedly, and was feeling under the weather the whole week, this was the week when I really put my all into the program, as well as continuing to build the relationships I had been building for the past two weeks, whether I was chatting with teachers during break times or being taken to the pharmacy to get cough drops. In addition, a Kazakh teacher at Shoqan had volunteered to give Colin and me two lessons of Kazakh! The lessons were pretty fast paced, but I was thoroughly grateful for the opportunity to learn.!#@p!#@After having taught with the standard materials for two weeks, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at writing my own problems and assignments for the students. In physics class, I wrote some problems meant to expose misconceptions⁠10 with simple harmonic motion and with energy. In chemistry, I taught about galvanic cells, taking a diagram of a galvanic cell from online, and erasing all of the labels except one. I was most proud of my initiative in AP Calculus, where I created a game of Kahoot for the students and wrote a page of u-substitution problems for them. I included a “challenge problem” where I broke solving the problem into multiple small steps.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_63C7399BEC43-1-2-1400x1050.jpeg]!#@That week, I also went to Daredzani⁠11 with Kai Juarez ’27, who was teaching at Haileybury. We really enjoyed the food. I especially liked the khinkali⁠12 that I ordered—I typically find food with mushrooms off-putting due to the texture, but I basically inhaled these khinkalis with no reservation about the texture.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UiQgCx0URK-yqm08WOFXNQ-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gIHgFOHBRael57rqm6OJ4A.jpg]!#@While leaving school on Thursday, I bumped into a group of the English teachers, all of whom I’d already met from teaching classes, who were going to play a game of Lord of the Rings trivia. Knowing nothing⁠13 about Lord of the Rings, I decided to come with them. There, I had a “mid” bowl of ramen and some excellent conversation. Since they were English teachers, there was no language barrier with them like there was with other teachers. Sometime in the middle of the evening, being engaged in a heated discussion about whether “double dipping” sauce was gross or not. We were all doubled over in laughter, the lights of the bar fresh on on faces and the smell of hookah smoke in the air. I thought to myself, I’m not ready to leave. I felt like the best part of the program had just started.!#@p!#@The last day of school is still fresh in my memory as I’m writing this. I played a game with some seventh graders in an English class and I had a “farewell meeting” with the students and with the faculty. 14 One of the students said that she had only started to understand the concepts in AP Calculus after I had explained them, and that she had really liked the questions I had written for the class. I was very very very touched by her words. In that moment, I though that I would remember that moment for as long as I lived.!#@p!#@After school, I visited Arystanbek, who suggested that I say goodbye to him before leaving. He wanted to give me something, even though his cabinets were full of just papers. I told him he didn’t have to give me anything. But he ultimately decided to give me his red pen. “This is the sign of a teacher,” he told me.!#@p!#@After it got dark, I went to Forum, a nearby mall, with two students. We went to a restaurant in the food court, Lanzhou, that served very tasty⁠15 Chinese food. One of the students mentioned how many different types of cuisines there were in Almaty, including Chinese, Korean, Indian, Mexican, and more.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/m3mnASsITZ-tf-GPP7xI4w-1000x1333.jpg]!#@In elementary school, I had considered becoming a teacher, but decided not to when I found out teachers teach the same thing(s) every year. But during this program, actually playing out the role of a teacher had made me reconsider, yet again. One of the many people I look up to is my AP Stats teacher, who had a long and fruitful career on Wall Street, and started teaching as a “soft retirement” of sorts. I wonder if, after the zenith of my career, life would sway me back towards the direction of my old dream.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bbgI9ES1Sryati1w5KVYpA-1400x1050.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EzGjcUH8To2DoCO6L5Sezw.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ae94_lxwTwSGABDpxVXUkw-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sMtT_CgqSGeTYfwAgNJT0A-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JVcjGzniS0qT0e-7LUtoKA.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cWvkMASYSCitocp8gCV1iA-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0WtR3j8xTEuKcyVesGOmUg-1000x1333.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_63C7399BEC43-1-2-1400x1050.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UiQgCx0URK-yqm08WOFXNQ-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gIHgFOHBRael57rqm6OJ4A.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/m3mnASsITZ-tf-GPP7xI4w-1000x1333.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/gtl-kazakhstan-%f0%9f%87%b0%f0%9f%87%bf-iap-2025/
Hydranting My Spring Semester by Jessica Z. '27,5 stages of courseroad grief,by Jessica Z. '27,"March 5, 2025","My mind has been struggling to internalize the scary fact that it’s been ~1.5 years since I came to MIT. Fall finals season helped me shove those feelings to the side, but now that spring classes have started, it feels like the clock is ticking louder than ever and choosing classes feels a lot heavier :<!#@p!#@All this to say, I’ve been browsing Hydrant⁠01 and Courseroad⁠02 for an abysmal amount of time post-finals⁠03 and thought I’d share my very, very, very messy process for deciding my sophomore spring classes! ⁠04!#@p!#@First, here’s some background and my preliminary thoughts for planning my classes:!#@p!#@With all that in mind, let’s get started!!#@p!#@I start planning my semester by not looking at the class times in Hydrant. Instead, I add every class that I have to take for my course requirements next semester (sans CI-H), then some required classes I’d like to take earlier rather than later if I have the space.!#@p!#@Afterwards, my schedule looked like this:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.23.44 PM-400x265.png]!#@I started poking around MIT’s Course Catalog⁠19 to read the class descriptions and started going down a rabbit hole of classes that also seemed interesting. So… I added a few more classes.!#@p!#@In the middle of my browsing, my friend pointed out that Prof. Erik Demaine is teaching an origami class this semester. In high school, my research focused on the intersections between origami and biomedical devices. I learned in college that my interests have shifted, but I still have a deep admiration for origami as a field of study. In fact, I mentioned his research in my very first high school science fair project, which helps illustrate how much I appreciate the field—needless to say, I spontaneously added his class to my schedule, too.!#@p!#@I spent a few minutes scrolling through Hydrant to add any class title that seemed interesting, barring they didn’t have a lot of pre-reqs and didn’t seem overly technical at first glance. Then… my friend messaged me with some other interesting classes he stumbled upon during his own Hydrant-ing, which I promptly added to my own.!#@p!#@Finally, ta-da! Version 1 of my spring semester schedule was done:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.18.41 PM-400x265.png]!#@This version was just to lay out which classes were available and seemed interesting without any considerations of actual feasibility. It’s a lot to see on one page, so I broke it down into a quick list by category:!#@p!#@Essential Classes: These are required classes for Course 20 and 15-1 that I have to take⁠20 now to stay on track for my major requirements and future courses.!#@p!#@Flexible Classes: These are required classes that I had originally planned for my junior and senior year but could hypothetically take next semester.!#@p!#@HASS Electives: These are some classes I found that fulfill HASS requirements (* = CI-H/W).!#@p!#@Misc Interests: Some other assorted classes that caught my eye :)!#@p!#@Surely there is some way to make this schedule work where I can take classes I enjoy, fulfill my course requirements without stressing myself out, and miraculously still survive! Right? I’ll start by working on all of the non-HASS classes and quickly eliminating the ones that fall to the bottom of the list after a second look:!#@p!#@And now HASS classes…!#@p!#@My five-minute run-through eliminated a grand total of 4 classes…out of the 23 originally listed.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.29.16 PM-400x265.png]!#@The delusion is always strong with Hydrant.!#@p!#@I knew STS.034 was the class I wanted to take the most. But after checking my schedule, it wouldn’t be possible to take with 6.100B. I checked if I could take the Course 20 coding alternative class, but I would have to push off until my junior year, in which case would also push back my lab classes.!#@p!#@That’s when the frustration kicked in. I (very unhelpfully) started thinking about how I should have tried to take 6.100B earlier or should have forced myself to do a coding class in high school. Somewhere along the lines, though, the anger got some-what productive. I didn’t solve my STS.034/6.100B scheduling conflict, but I did eliminate a bunch of other classes if they weren’t particularly urgent.!#@p!#@The classes still in the running:!#@p!#@Which brings our stage 2, post-anger Courseroad to… drum-roll please…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-12.28.16 PM-400x273.png]!#@Some quick things I did in a desperate attempt to solve my STS.034/6.100B conflict (in varying levels of seriousness):!#@p!#@Depressions a bit of a strong word for this, so I changed it to strong disappointment. My bargaining didn’t get me very far, and it became pretty clear I’d have to make a decision when one of the 20.320 lab staff emailed me back kindly explaining it would be realllyyyy hard for me to take 6.100B as a co-req instead of a pre-req because all the psets involved coding :'(!#@p!#@In a last ditch desperate attempt to take STS.034 and 20.S901 instead of 6.100B, I spend an abysmal amount of time on Courseroad trying to make it work :’)!#@p!#@At the end, though, there were some other things I realized:!#@p!#@All of this circled back to an inevitable truth that always seems to repeat itself to me, although I’m not sure when I’ll fully accept it: I need more time, and that means not doing everything I’d like to.!#@p!#@The last stage, acceptance, came with swallowing a few more hard truths I think I always knew:!#@p!#@With that, I felt good enough to finalize my schedule. Presenting (finally!) my Spring Hydrant:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-12.35.26 PM-400x273.png]!#@Can’t wait to rinse and repeat next semester!!#@p!#@All jokes aside, it’s a bit daunting to think about how it’s my sophomore spring. I’m only have two more IAPs, two more fall semesters, two more CPWs left… the list goes on.!#@p!#@The largest hard truth: there’s simply not enough time on campus to do everything I want to do. I have a lot of ramblings about MIT, the good and bad, but I also have a loooonnggg list of things I want to do before I graduate.⁠23 I’ve been away from blogging because of some personal matters, but I’m back, and I’m excited to see how this semester goes :^)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.23.44 PM-400x265.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.18.41 PM-400x265.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-5.29.16 PM-400x265.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-12.28.16 PM-400x273.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-12.35.26 PM-400x273.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hydranting-my-spring-semester/
[Guest Post] An Overthinker’s Guide to Finishing Your Transfer Application by Jeremy W.,by Warren K. ’27,by Jeremy W.,"March 4, 2025","The fall transfer application deadline is coming up. I tried to remember how I was feeling last year when the deadline was coming up…and then I remembered that I submitted my application in January. Last spring I was both working in the Navy full-time and attending college full-time, so I had to budget my time carefully. I made the plan to do most of my application work during winter break so I could devote my full attention to it. In early January, I realized that even though I could return to and edit my application endlessly (at least until March), the edits I was making weren’t a good use of my time and weren’t making my application any better. I got some good advice from a friend and they helped me understand that I had already spent the right amount of time working on it.!#@p!#@Since I started at MIT, I’ve had a bunch of folks ask me for application advice. There is already a bunch of great advice on this blog, but with the deadline nearing I thought I’d add my two cents. Disclaimer: I do not work in admissions or read applications for a living (though I did ask someone who does to look at this before publishing *cough cough* Jeremy 👀).!#@p!#@Without further ado, and in no particular order, here’s some advice and resources that I found helpful while applying:!#@p!#@Good luck, y’all! Transferring is a stressful process, and you’re showing a lot of grit and resilience just by applying. To all the folks who are working full-time, military veterans, my fellow public university and community college students—I’ve been where you’re at. Transferring to MIT is possible, and I look forward to meeting y’all this fall. Godspeed.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-overthinkers-guide-to-finishing-your-transfer-application/
ms paint sidequest by Kayode D. '27,by kayode and caleb on a monday night,by Kayode D. '27,"March 4, 2025","Hallo!!#@p!#@My friend, Caleb M. ‘27 and I are currently in the MIT Student Center, and we need to be working.!#@p!#@I’m currently working on an assignment for 2.007, which was due Sunday night at Midnight. I’ll explain more about the class in my next blog, to be posted this week, but this is what work I’ve accomplished tonight:!#@p!#@I CADed up this piece for my robot in the last hour. I call this “The Finger,” because it’s what I will use to grip and switch a lever back and forth. It’s attached to a beam I’ll call “The Arm”, and a base I’ll call… well I don’t really have a name for that. I’ve just been referring to this robot as “Big Man,” so I guess that’s what I’ll call it.!#@p!#@Here’s the prototype I built in lab today. It uses two rubber bands to create a one-way door to catch hold onto the levers. Pretty neat!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-003808.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-001150-800x497.png]!#@I’m not sure what Caleb is supposed to be working on.!#@p!#@We currently have only one laptop charger and both of our laptops are near dead.!#@p!#@The Sidequest:!#@p!#@Yesterday, I made a comment on Ellie’s Fantastic Blog, in which I quickly edited together this image in MS Paint:!#@p!#@After this, I wondered if it would be possible to make a program that could put any image into this little frame for you. It would be neat if it also lowered the resolution by a bit, and matched the colors to the closest ones in the default ms paint color palette. It might take some time, but this could also be done to a video if done correctly. The more I thought about it, the more I thought it was definitely possible.!#@p!#@About an hour ago, I told this idea to my friend, Caleb M. ‘27, who is also here. We started talking and he said that it is most definitely possible, and possible in under an hour.!#@p!#@I’m currently***** taking 6.101, a coding class at MIT. One of our most recent assignments was an image modulation lab, and we did a lot with modifying image pixel colors and locations. It was honestly a really hard lab, but we realized that basically all of the framework needed to make this happen [also, Caleb did really well in that class so he can do all of the coding and i can do all of the blogging :[]  ]!#@p!#@We both stopped working, and since I’ve started writing this blog about our little ms paint sidequest, Caleb has finished modifying the first video!!#@p!#@I chose this one i found by searching for “dancing old man” on google:!#@p!#@https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4FuPdMskeI!#@p!#@Here’s the output we got:!#@p!#@It works!! We immediately noticed that it is very desaturated.!#@p!#@TAKEAWAYS for next time:!#@p!#@next time:!#@p!#@This time we used a more colorful video:!#@p!#@https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzKURp_OJV0!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@it’s 1:50 now. here’s caleb with the lowdown of what’s goin’ on:!#@p!#@Hi there. So if you’ve taken or are taking 6.101, you may remember the lab Image Processing 2. In that lab, we wrote various functions that allowed us to manipulate images, messing with the colors, applying filters, things like that. Because I didn’t want to write all of this stuff anew, I decided to directly use my lab from 3 semesters ago, which gave me access to a handful of functions to manipulate images. So my thought process was:!#@p!#@1. Divide a video into a series of frames,!#@p!#@2. Edit each frame as an image to match the color scheme of MS Paint using the functions in the lab, and!#@p!#@3. Stich the frames back together in the video.!#@p!#@To do step 1, I used Windows Powershell with an ffmpeg command to split the video into a bunch of frames. Easy. No Exclamation Point, or parentheses for this statement. Sorry. Anyway: In Image Processing 2, we wrote a helper called apply_per_pixel that let us pass in an image and a function to apply to each colored pixel and then would produce a new image with that filter applied. I wanted the filter to choose the closest color from the MS Paint Windows Vista color palette, so I wrote a short helper function that initially compared the sum of the absolute differences between the Red, Green, and Blue values of the pixel at hand to each MS Paint color and return the one with the smallest sum, which I imagined yield the “closest color.” This approach, however, returned us with the first video, where many pixels just became grey. I realized that the simple sum of the differences wasn’t the most effective method to find how close each color was, so I instead replaced this with the Euclidian Distance between the MS Paint Color and the color of the pixel, imagining each color as a 3D Vector: sqrt[[r2-r1]^2 + [b2-b1]^2 + [b2-b1]^2]. This was a much stronger approach that yielded a much more colorful result exclamation point. I then made a loop to read each frame from the folder that I saved them into, apply_per_pixel the helper to choose and apply the closest MS Paint color and construct a new image, and then save that into a new file. Step 2 complete exclamation point. Finally, I returned to my trusty Powershell and ffmpeg to stitch all the frames back together, completing Step 3 and returning our final video [okay and then I used Premiere for the MS Paint frame but whatever that’s not the cool part].

Bad Ideas Month by Ellie F. '28,word of the day is oops!!,by Ellie F. '28,"March 3, 2025","I’m no cook when it comes to normal food, but if stupid ideas were dishes, I’d be head chef of a Michelin-starred restaurant (or at least I’d like to think so). Unfortunately, at MIT, most of my computational power has been devoted to “psets” and “midterms” and not Silly Girl Time, but when the Bad Ideas Weekend email (and subsequent reminder email) hit my inbox like [redacted], I knew it was showtime.!#@p!#@Every year, during three days in IAP⁠01 , Bad Ideas Weekend takes hold in MIT like glitter: it’s everywhere, if you look hard enough, and it catches the light, even in the dark. Students run activities silly and absurd and sometimes delicious, and even more students emerge to bake rat-shaped cakes and play IRL Fruit Ninja and take their minds off the constant demands of an MIT education. Bad Ideas Weekend was my calling. I sent in two event proposals, and thought nothing more of it for two months.!#@p!#@One Month Before Bad Ideas!#@p!#@I had a plan for IAP. A blissful period of rest, exploring Boston museums, baking desserts, learning to ice skate and drawing murals and spending my evenings with my friends. Sure, I had a UROP⁠02 that would take up most of my time during the day, and I also needed to finish a homework packet for my 18.03 ASE⁠03 , but I’d still have more than enough time to get my fill of goofing around before the hell of spring semester started.!#@p!#@The first Bad Idea I was running was Huge Ping Pong. I don’t know if you noticed, but Normal Ping Pong is really hard. Those paddles are so small, and I keep missing! The solution, obviously, is to make giant paddles, which would solve all my ping-pong-related problems. And though I had no idea where to host my event, or where to get the wood, or even how to use any power tools whatsoever, I was confident that my half-baked idea would end up working.!#@p!#@Three Weeks Before Bad Ideas!#@p!#@IAP started off just how I imagined. In the first week, I practiced a beautiful piano piece, started learning glassblowing, rehearsed for a Video Game Orchestra Tetris performance, and explored the Institute for Contemporary Art. It was heaving, until Sunday, when I realized I had worked about ten hours less than I was planning. And I hadn’t even touched 18.03.!#@p!#@In a desperate moment of clarity, I sat down to meticulously plan out every hour of my day the next week. Mornings and afternoons were dedicated to my UROP, and evenings were for 18.03 and miscellaneous responsibilities. Then, the MIT Mystery Hunt suddenly consumed four days of my life, and I was left with one week to finish about two-thirds of a giant homework packet.!#@p!#@My second Bad Idea was S’mores with Various Questionable Sources of Fire⁠04 . It was yet another event I was wholly unprepared for–the most fire safety training I’ve done has been Stop Drop and Roll back in elementary school. Sadly, the event was axed for safety reasons, or so I thought. Just a few days before Bad Ideas Weekend, I was suddenly notified that s’mores was back on, but without all the fire-making contraptions. And we had no supplies. I called an emergency meeting, and my co-conspirator Caroline and I decided, in a last-minute change of plans, to make our event now centered around gourmet smores⁠05 .!#@p!#@Three Days Before Bad Ideas!#@p!#@At this point, things are dire for my ASE. We cook up a plan.!#@p!#@Mission Don’t Fail 18.03:!#@p!#@The first few days went alright. Although my back hurt and my legs were probably atrophying from disuse, I was definitely making progress. Not as much as I had hoped, sure, but still enough to be on track to finish. And then…!#@p!#@Dawn of Bad Ideas Weekend!#@p!#@Saturday brought with it the s’mores event, and though the 18.03 exam was drawing nearer, the need to stuff my face with marshmallows was too strong. After all, I deserved a little treat. Caroline had bought the supplies, and when I arrived, we started toasting marshmallows. Among our spread of gourmet choices was Peeps, jelly-filled marshmallows, Nutella, strawberry jam, Feastables, and slices of whole wheat bread.!#@p!#@MIT Science Olympiad happened to be holding its awards ceremony right next door, so I’d go into Kresge Auditorium’s lobby to advertise free s’mores, and like the Pied Piper, I’d leave with a gaggle of high schoolers trailing behind me. Within an hour and a half, our supplies had run out, but a gaggle of my friends stayed to chat and poke at the fire. Ian offered to buy free boba from Teado, and while we were there, Liong, in the interest of Bad Ideas, ordered a water boba, setting off a microtrend to the amusement and befuddlement of the barista.!#@p!#@When we walked back outside, we were treated to the sight of a steaming trash can that would have definitely been labeled as carcinogenic in California. In the confused aftermath, we carried a table down and up a flight of stairs, but we eventually got everything squared away. All in all, no injuries were had, and also I got to embezzle a mostly full jar of Nutella from the event, so it was a huge win.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-1-800x1732.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-2-800x370.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-3-800x370.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-5-800x926.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-6-800x1732.jpg]!#@I didn’t get that much work done for 18.03 that night, but I did eat a hefty amount of Nutella.!#@p!#@Bright and early next morning was my ping pong event. Although some wood was allocated for the paddles, I realized it wouldn’t work well, so I snatched the largest sheet of wood I could find at Reuse⁠06 . I explained to a Metropolis mentor my predicament (no training with any woodworking or power tools oops!), and they recommended I use the laser cutter. We traced out a paddle shape, and after some debugging, both paddles were cut out!!#@p!#@It was then that I realized we didn’t have a ball. I took a trip back to Simmons and pilfered a few balls from the ballpit, one of which we spray painted white. We put some finishing touches on the painted paddles and headed outside to play. Unfortunately, giant ping pong is not easier than regular ping pong :(!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-1-800x520.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-2-800x533.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-3-800x1434.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-6-800x370.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-7-800x370.jpg]!#@That evening, I finally finished my 18.03 homework packet, with a day to spare. Still, I felt my grasp on all the concepts, especially the earlier ones, was shaky at best. I spent one more day forcing myself to work through as many practice exams as I could, feeling my confidence repeatedly build and crumble with every problem I got correct or incorrect.!#@p!#@In the end, it all worked out. Despite not having any woodworking skills, I successfully made ping pong paddles. Despite cancellations and last minute changes, s’mores ran smoothly. And despite procrastinating on and underestimating the difficulty of 18.03, I managed to pass the ASE. It’s a boost to my confidence, I suppose, but I mostly look back on my IAP as a lesson in what not to do. I overcommitted myself, took on too much unnecessary stress, and I paid the price mentally. I’ve now promised myself to use IAP to explore new hobbies, be with my friends, and relax, and overall, not turn Bad Ideas Weekend into Bad Ideas Month. Check back in next year to see if it worked!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-1-800x1732.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-2-800x370.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-3-800x370.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-5-800x926.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/smores-6-800x1732.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-1-800x520.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-2-800x533.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-3-800x1434.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-6-800x370.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ping-pong-7-800x370.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/bad-ideas-month/
Night at da Opera by Kayode D. '27,A Jolly Splendid Time!!,by Kayode D. '27,"March 1, 2025","This semester, I’m taking a class called 21.01, “Love, Death, and Taxes”. It’s a CI-H⁠01 philosophy class, and it’s a grand old time! The class looks at moral and social questions concerning the human experience, and is set up in a discussion-focused style with debates and discourse. One of my big pulls for the class, though, were the field trips. That’s right. Field trips. In 2025. In College. Yep.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Opera-Baby-1.jpg]!#@The class is a lot of fun! We talk about things like what separates an aggregation from an association⁠02 , and what makes someone a genius⁠03 .!#@p!#@I also met some pretty neat people! My friends, Jessie L. 27’ and Pierre C. are taking the class with me, and we discuss philosophy and values and the the human condition together. We also watched the Super Bowl! When the TAs sent out the form announcing the field trip options, we agreed to go to all three [an opera, a concert, and a play] together.!#@p!#@But let’s be real. I had no idea what I signed up for with this opera thing. I didn’t know where it was, when it was, I didn’t even really know what an opera was. Like conceptually I understood, but I had no idea what it actually entailed. I just got in the uber and ended up somewhere in Boston with a ticket. When we sat down I asked someone how long this was supposed to be, and they told me FOUR HOURS. I signed up for FOUR HOURS of a thing I didn’t even understand! And the orchestra didn’t even have any drums! Only timpani’s⁠04 !!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Wide-Show.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Seated.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Crowd.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Screen.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Percussion.jpg]!#@We went to see the opera “Lysistrata, or The Nude Goddess” at Jordan Hall in Boston. Luckily, it wasn’t four hours straight of percussion-less orchestra music, and actors came out a few minutes in. The play was written by Mark Adamo in the early 2000s as an adaptation of the original Lysistrata, written by Aristophanes in 411 BC. This new version is thankfully in English and adapted to make more sense in modern times, and I enjoyed it!!#@p!#@Essentially, the opera is about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The women of both cities think that the war is foolish and they’ll end up killing each other senselessly, so they agree to lock themselves in the Athens armory and not have sex or spend any time with any of their husbands until they end the war. At first this seemed stupid, since the characters even pointed out that there were prostitutes in the town, so the men wouldn’t comply, but it actually worked. It wasn’t just the flesh desires, but they also longed to be with their wives. It made them question which they loved more, their feud or their wives.!#@p!#@There was a lot of back and forth, and eventually even the women wondered which they loved more: peace or their husbands. The women renamed Lysia, the woman who started the movement,  to be “Lysistrata” which means “disbander of armies,” even though she had decided in herself to leave the cause to be with her husband.!#@p!#@Eventually, the men showed that they loved their wives more than the war, and wanted to end the fighting to be with them. However after everything had been resolved and they were writing up the treaty over a feast, another fight broke out. This ended with the generals stabbing one another and both falling dead. Their wives rush to their sides, see their husbands are dead and pull the knifes out, turning to face one another. Plot Twist!! Now THEY are the ones fighting the war senselessly!!#@p!#@At the end of the play, in true Deus Ex Machina fashion, the gods Aphrodite and Ares descended to the people to end their war. I think it was a Rick and Morty reference, but I’m not quite sure.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Curtain-Call.jpg]!#@After the opera, we went to get tacos from El Jefe’s across the street. Delicioso!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Street.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-El-Jefes.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Food.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-The-Gang.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Central.jpg]!#@It also snowed like, a bunches.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Kresge.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Stud.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Field.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Field-Two.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Simmons.jpg]!#@…!#@p!#@One thing we’ve talked about a lot in our class is values. In one exercise, we wrote out all of the things we value and why we value them, and drew connecting lines back to find the core values [you might value hard work, and you value that because you value being useful, which is because you value helping people, because you value love]. I wrote things like Honesty, Loyalty, and Growth, and everything connected back to my relationship with God and how He has worked in me the last few months. The bible sets the groundwork and frame for who I want to become and be.!#@p!#@Looking at that list, I could see a noticeable shift from my values when I came to MIT. If you asked me before coming to MIT or during freshman year what I valued I would say things like getting a good job, or accomplishing some big MIT thing, or doing something worth being remembered for. Now I think I value a lot less what I accomplish while in college and more the person that I become while in college. I was so obsessed with reaching some unseen, unreachable goal that would suddenly make my feel accomplished and satisfied that I didn’t think about the person I was or who I was becoming. I wasn’t growing.!#@p!#@Now, I realize that MIT is a marathon, not a sprint. I don’t have to run the same pace as the guys in the front or the guy who set the world record for marathon, I just have to keep going and be the best runner I can be. It took a lot of experiences to come to this realization, but I’m glad that I changed my focus to my self, rather than what I do.!#@p!#@OK, that’s enough deep thinking for today. I never know how to end a blog. Bye.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Opera-Baby-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Wide-Show.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Seated.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Crowd.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Screen.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Percussion.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Curtain-Call.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Street.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-El-Jefes.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Food.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-The-Gang.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Central.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Kresge.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Stud.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Field.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Field-Two.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Snow-Simmons.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/night-at-da-opera/

what makes fear worth it by Kai V. '25,musical theater and anxiety,by Kai V. '25,"February 27, 2025","Despite being a brief and shallow fan of Hamilton in middle school, I didn’t fully grasp the concept of musical theater until college. Hamilton, to me, existed as a series of songs someone had compiled in a YouTube playlist. Somehow everyone in the comments was stringing together a coherent plot from these songs; being ignorant of the fact that they were actually performed live, interspersed among acting scenes, I marveled at the commenters’ powers of inference.!#@p!#@When I saw Firebringer in my freshman fall at MIT—urged to attend by other people on my hall involved in the production—it lingered in my mind for days after. How was it possible for a group of college students to tell a story so vividly and intensely? It was about more than the acting, more than the singing, more than the dancing. I attended no shortage of plays and a cappella performances and dance showcases (and—bonus—the Boston Ballet). These were all good. I enjoyed them. But I was never once touched as deeply as I have been, consistently, by musical theater.!#@p!#@So what is it? Maybe it’s the writing, this undercurrent of dark humor that runs through most musicals I’ve seen. Lots of musicals have this structure where Act I is relatively normal and Act II flips the story on its head in a totally unexpected, fucked-up manner. But musicals with conventional story structures have made me cry, too.!#@p!#@Is it a sense of immersion? The lights, sound, and set design tend to be more elaborate for musicals than for concerts or dances. Maybe a musical puts more effort into crafting a specific experience for the audience. But that can’t be the only thing—seeing a movie in a theater is more immersive, and I’m rarely as touched by a movie as a musical.!#@p!#@What really makes musical theater my favorite medium is also its defining characteristic, the live performance of over-the-top musical numbers. Over-the-top is key: the entire medium is predicated on the idea that a character’s (or group of characters’) internal state of mind warrants a whole song and dance number. It elevates the character’s direct, internal experience of the world to an even higher level of importance than its subtler external manifestation as dialogue or body language. A production can’t shy away once it’s entered this stage: our inner worlds are so complex, so intensely and deeply felt, that to invert the character, to manifest their inside in the outer world, requires a commitment to fantasy. Yes, in this world everyone else knows the choreography by heart, everyone else knows the lyrics and joins in seamlessly and spontaneously, there’s even a live orchestra with an upright bass player—isn’t this how it happens in our heads, too?!#@p!#@It’s this brash inversion of self that I love, that runs so counter to conventions of social interaction. When my attempts at conversation are warped by a desire for relatability to the point of being unrecognizable, when the failure to be understood by other people makes me feel sick with disappointment—and when I say failure I don’t mean solely that we miss deep understanding but that we misunderstand even each other’s surface level meanings, that I’m unintentionally and unwillingly telling lies all the time in service of convenience and conformity—there are two reprieves I turn to.!#@p!#@First is to retreat inside my head and draw the curtains closed—by writing, mostly, a process during which I don’t think about other people at all. Though I often end up posting my writing online, and it’s a wonderful feeling when people comment on it and reveal they’ve given my work their attention for a few minutes, this joy is separate from the peace that the bare activity of writing brings me. Writing is a time to lean into my wildest inclinations with no regard for other people’s expectations. So success in writing, to me, means honesty—not in the sense that I’ve been factually accurate but in the sense that I’ve painted a world that reflects something that was really inside me.!#@p!#@And second is to consume art: to watch others flip themselves inside out. To release the mess they contain—to organize it in some way, of course, to present it as song or dance or another art, to reduce its unlimited dimensionality to a physically comprehensible form—putting in years of effort just for the hope that someone somewhere will view it and understand what they mean.!#@p!#@Through art the concept of a stranger transforms from an unknowable figure, an opponent in a game, to someone to open your heart to despite whatever anxiety you feel about a world in which you have no hope of bridging the gap between you and other people. That’s what making art is for me: not a statement of trust, exactly, but a statement of hope.!#@p!#@I wanted to try this, too—to open the curtains, to turn myself inside out on a stage. Maybe then I would feel understood.!#@p!#@After seeing Firebringer I had a brief stint of involvement with MIT’s Musical Theater Guild, which puts on all these productions. Lacking the confidence to audition, instead I designed some posters and ran the sound board for Into the Woods that spring.!#@p!#@Running sound is a nontrivial task especially for a show with as much interwoven dialogue as Into the Woods. I fucked up more than once. So although I loved the show, I was also nervous every night, afraid to let down all the other people on the cast and crew. Apprehensive about repeating the experience, I slunk away until this winter—three years later—when finally I signed up for an audition slot for Cabaret.!#@p!#@In the four weeks of IAP before Cabaret’s opening night, we learned the lines, choreo, and vocals in evening rehearsals scattered around rooms in the Stud. In the final week (“prod week”), we ran the show in full every night, progressively adding sound and lights and set and orchestra. Finally at the end of IAP we had the first weekend of real performances.!#@p!#@I thought acting would be like a more intense and active version of the audience experience. What I got was more intense and active, but along a different axis: getting closer to the workings of the show didn’t immediately make me feel more connected to the audience or to other actors on stage. It was difficult to channel the kind of energy I wanted when so much cognition was being spent on coarser movements—how to time my entry, the broad strokes of choreo, hitting the correct notes and words.!#@p!#@The gap between doing it right and doing it honestly manifested in all the details I had no energy or skill to spare for, like the fine control over facial expression, gesture, and tone that the lead actors refined over the course of prod week. Or the emotional continuity between scenes, being able to step out of the wings where you’ve been sitting watching other people dance around for 20 minutes and immediately enter the state of high emotional tension that your character left off in their last scene.!#@p!#@This gap between personal taste and realized quality of one’s work is present in any medium, of course. I was introduced to it by the Ira Glass quote:!#@p!#@I’m lucky that I started writing early enough that it became a comforting activity long before I cared about the taste-vs-skill gap. But I can’t say the same for musical theater. Maybe past some threshold of singing or acting skill, when you open your mouth you’re able to tap into a beautiful, fulfilling connection, to energize a wire which thrums with understanding between you and everyone else in the room. I’m very far from that.!#@p!#@Still, being a part of Cabaret was beautiful. Each night before the start of the show, we gathered in the dressing room to do our hair and makeup. Everyone was bursting with the desire to sing, all the time. Sometimes someone played Hozier or Lady Gaga on their speaker and we all joined in, one after the other—or the soft hum of a lyric from the show would morph into a full-fledged song—either way the dressing room blossomed with music every night, voices mingling, shoes squeaking in impromptu dance across the wooden floor.!#@p!#@In these moments, in the silent and shared agreement to sing together, to break into harmony and melody, lead and backing parts, I felt it: not a knife through my anxiety, which came in waves throughout the night regardless, but a reason to walk with it. A confirmation of hope.!#@p!#@After the run of Cabaret was over, I found myself listening to songs from musicals in my spare time. On shuffle, a song from Into the Woods that I had entirely forgotten about came up.!#@p!#@It feels like I’m alone when this fear arrives. Surrounded on all sides by a barrier totally excluding the possibility of touch. Even if your hand rests against mine, could I ever hope to know what you’re feeling? Listening to No One Is Alone now, touched through a three-year-thick blanket of time by my memories of the actor on stage choking out the lyrics between tears, something like regret washed over me. What if I had stayed after Into the Woods? Auditioned for the next musical when I felt like it? Would I now be able to connect with people the way I felt connected with when I watch musicals? Would I be less inhibited, more confident, more present?!#@p!#@During Cabaret I was torn over whether to audition for MTG again. But on the Tuesday after closing night, the first time in three weeks that I’d gone 48 hours without performing the show, I realized—despite my imperfect performances; despite the constant danger of disappointing others and myself; despite the workload—that I missed it. I missed getting the chance to make art with other people, even if at times it felt like I was failing. Because in the end we made something beautiful anyway, despite any mistakes, something that made the audience laugh and cry and reflect deeply on the world we had created.!#@p!#@My anxiety has receded since freshman year but still I sometimes find myself gripped by nausea, sweating and shivering, nerves screaming for anything but the current moment, cold shock through my heart at a glance into the dark future. But it doesn’t matter in the end. There’s only one choice to make when this fear creeps in, and it’s to hold on to hope or to give up. Yes, I’ve given up before, all those times I let anxiety deter me from going to the gym or psetting with people or asking a question. But I’ve also looked this fear in the eye and walked with it out the other side and found someone who loved my art—or someone whose art I loved. Someone whose voice felt as familiar as a friend’s. Someone whose performance of a scene let me know they understood everything.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-makes-fear-worth-it/

anyways, i’m here to talk about IAP! i used my first IAP to rest from 1st semester, explore boston, get ready to UROP, and train for track season! today, i’m going to focus on the track part.!#@p!#@after flying in on sunday, the team got right back to practice on wednesday. our 1st meet was that weekend, so we had no time to waste. i honestly can’t remember much from the days leading up to the meet…but some of the pole vaulters did make a minecraft server. the 1st meet was at the new balance track, which is a super fancy track facility across the bridge in boston. since i had never competed in a real college meet before, i honestly was just looking to have fun. i ended up jumping 8’ 8.25 (the conversion is weird since college track uses meters…not very american), which is a little under a foot under my high school PR, so not bad!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475532394_629868679455483_7274935307563379927_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476582916_537125675377587_485684300028849772_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476020910_910264430977080_2105019479438285329_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476384620_1004159348194507_5925082621362723598_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475870205_807880591531459_288765207000571832_n.jpg]!#@this week’s competition was 2 hours away at the university of rhode island: before this, i had never been to rhode island, so that was pretty cool. it was also fun to go to a meet farther away and travel with the team: unfortunately though, because this was a “D1” meet (at least it was being hosted by a D1 team), the opening height was pretty high for me, and i “no-heighted” (did not clear a single bar). it was still fun to cheer on my fellow vaulters, though, and only gave me motivation for next week…!#@p!#@i didn’t get any pictures from one of the pole vault squad’s most fun annual traditions, “guys/girls cook” dinner (with this week being guys cook), but they made tacos. yum!

i’ve literally been looking forward to this day for months. i think for this one i’m just going to let the pictures speak for themselves.
the team was back at new balance later this weekend: i tagged along to both meets, but unfortunately i got a concussion earlier that week, so i couldn’t compete :( the team was looking good! on the way back to the bus, though, one of the pole bags was accidentally carried the wrong way, or the cap wasn’t taped on good enough, or something like that, because the whole bag of poles spilled down the stairs…rip.
the next day was girls cook! we made pasta with vodka sauce and italian sausage, garlic bread, cesar salad, and i made some banana bread, too. 10/10.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475659625_1151113306606439_8581511566744639717_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475813795_1293486968555472_5186031911244557192_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475878214_9270941039638308_444142494148341302_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476849392_1714545175760189_8646510902279052439_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475682253_588893170624482_4852796083411954740_n.jpg]!#@last meet of IAP :(( like last week, this was a split gender meet, so guys went on friday, with girls on saturday. after the men competed, the squad went to el jefe’s in harvard square for some bomb mexican food. saturday competition was GREAT: i finally cleared 9’ for the 1st time in college, but after that i had to get on larger poles that i had ever been on before (there are a number of reasons for this, but in short it’s good if you are getting on bigger/longer poles). i had to go up in length (12’ to 13’), and different length poles bend differently and…yeah i didn’t clear anymore bars, but i was happy that i was performing so well that i had to get out bigger poles, so yay!
for fun, i’ve included some other fun pics from the week, too.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475730585_984232839801201_8022446184016588898_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475730903_520719060495591_1993584559711040802_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475449846_970225821270499_1221545946529639331_n.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/474270060_8962170207228039_4257680886153023332_n.jpg]!#@and that was part of my IAP! i’ve already talked a lot so i’m going to hand the microphone (i mean the blog) back to angie: THANK YOU AGAIN ANGIE!!!!#@p!#@——————————————————————————————————————!#@p!#@YAY THANK YOU SARAH! next up is…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/75780406271__7AEA4A37-460E-457E-8F5F-3988D12C72B4-400x533.jpg]!#@Over IAP I took a lot of different classes. I mainly participated in Momentum and Web Lab, which are some of many IAP classes in which students work on a project they later showcase in a final competition.!#@p!#@Every year, Momentum students work with a different partner organization and divide into teams to tackle different facets of a real-world issue. This year, our partner was MIT’s Lincoln Lab (which we were able to tour during the first week of the class) and our challenge was wildfires. My team’s contribution was basically just a system of sensors that would be brought out into the field to monitor factors like humidity levels, temperature, and volatile organic compounds concentration that could put areas at a higher risk for wildfires; in the event that something looked off, they’d send a signal to whoever was monitoring the area.!#@p!#@As for Web Lab, it aims to teach the fundamentals of web development to students across all class years. Students form teams and use what they’ve learned in class to build their own website based on the year’s theme (this year’s was “Branching Out”), and the class culminates in a competition in which participating teams can win up to $5,000! I spent a lot of IAP working on my website.!#@p!#@We had lectures for the first two weeks of Momentum and Web Lab. I also sat in on lectures for BattleCode, another competition-based CS class in which teams write code for an autonomous player in a real-time strategy game. I decided not to compete this year, but it was really interesting seeing what was going on over there. Additionally, all three of those classes had a lot of guest speakers: one of the ones from BattleCode was a partner at Y Combinator, which was really cool. I also sat in on algorithms⁠03 and some SIPB⁠04 mini-lectures: I went to a “Building with AI” one and that was pretty cool: I got to build a project using Windsurf for the first time.!#@p!#@Finally, I took a quantum computing course! I lowkey did not understand what was going on because it had a lot of linear algebra, which I haven’t taken yet, but the parts that I did understand were really cool and inspired me to look into quantum computing a little more. Now, I think it’s something that I might want to pursue later with my degree. I’m also going to participate in iQuHack, MIT’s quantum computing hackathon.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2540-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2541-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2532-800x1067.jpg]!#@I played in the snow a lot, which is really nice because I am from Texas so obviously it doesn’t really snow that often. I got to play in the snow with my favorite, Angie Fortnite⁠05 ; build a lot of snowmen; and ice skate! I also went sledding down a hill in Alewife. It was really fun, but I completely tumbled over myself and hit my head.!#@p!#@Outside of campus, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts which was also pretty fun. My favorite part is the jewelry section. And I went to Matcha Café, which is probably my favorite matcha place ever!#@p!#@I was not on a meal plan at all and I also wasn’t really going out and buying food, so I was mostly eating in my classes⁠06 but luckily, I live in Juniper and the girls there are so sweet and good at cooking, so I got to eat a lot of really nice food. Also, my dad sent me a case of new teas around the same time one of my friends brought some tea from China, so we had a cute little tea party with that!!#@p!#@Finally, I also got back to my science olympiad roots! I did science olympiad in high school, and this IAP I got to volunteer at the MIT Science Olympiad. Being on the other side of all the events was a really nice experience. I’m also volunteering at the Harvard venture capital conference which is pretty interesting because I don’t really know anything about VC yet.!#@p!#@So yeah, I think that was my whole IAP! Pretty busy, but I had a lot of fun.!#@p!#@——————————————————————————————————————!#@p!#@thank you Christine :)! as for me, IAP was prime time for hard resetting my brain after a semester of a routine that, while far more exciting than all the ones i’d previously held, was a routine nonetheless. i think MIT is, like any other place, what you make of it. so, when work piles up, i always make a conscious effort to see the place i spent so much of high school dreaming about past the repetition and mountain of psets; the days where i do this successfully are often just as good as, if not better than, the ones i spend on instantly satisfying activities where i don’t have to think too hard to feel grateful. but i’m far from perfect, and the change of pace IAP brought made me aware of so many little things about myself, bad habits i’d carried over from high school and destructive patterns i’d constantly fall into, that slipped through the cracks during the hours and days of fall semester i spent just going through the motions. some of my goals from IAP went unaccomplished, and lots of my most meticulous plans ended up falling completely flat. but i grew and learned about myself in ways that i now see had gone ignored for way too long.!#@p!#@largely thanks to everything i took away from IAP, spring semester is pretty great. i don’t have many words to describe how it feels to live surrounded by friends, to spend my days learning about whatever i want, to be overwhelmed by opportunities to make a real impact on the world around me everywhere i step. even on my worst days, i feel a little tug on my heart when i walk past a snow angel on Kresge or see the overflowing bulletin boards in the infinite or catch peeks of the river from my window that reminds me that there’s still no place i’d rather be than here. and the days that follow these dark periods are usually extra bright to compensate: it always reminds me of when, on my third day of what had previously been an extremely cloudy and gray CPW⁠07 , i walked out of my host’s building only to be bathed in sunlight, my first of many brushes with Boston’s funny way of saying sorry.!#@p!#@i’m grateful for MIT, and i’m grateful for everyone who chooses to share this experience with me through this blog. i’ll leave you all with some pictures from my IAP :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3084-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2870-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3281-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3557-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3586-800x1289.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_6706-400x234.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475532394_629868679455483_7274935307563379927_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476582916_537125675377587_485684300028849772_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476020910_910264430977080_2105019479438285329_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476384620_1004159348194507_5925082621362723598_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475870205_807880591531459_288765207000571832_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476374163_29332100566389262_4423582188738355600_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475876407_588478607495041_1988555246651339228_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475696462_539206502487848_7207598675295795048_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476026909_1139855954535587_4534152562050808809_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476863669_597547323046891_2774363427633127096_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475659625_1151113306606439_8581511566744639717_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475813795_1293486968555472_5186031911244557192_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475878214_9270941039638308_444142494148341302_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/476849392_1714545175760189_8646510902279052439_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475682253_588893170624482_4852796083411954740_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475730585_984232839801201_8022446184016588898_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475730903_520719060495591_1993584559711040802_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/475449846_970225821270499_1221545946529639331_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/474270060_8962170207228039_4257680886153023332_n.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/75780406271__7AEA4A37-460E-457E-8F5F-3988D12C72B4-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2540-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2541-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2532-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3084-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2870-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3281-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3557-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3586-800x1289.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-am-prettylatebutheresaniappost/

"What Is This, a Crossover Episode? by Andi Q. '25",Jacob Collier and Yo-Yo Ma come to MIT,by Andi Q. '25,"February 23, 2025","During the first MIT Wind Ensemble (MITWE) rehearsal this semester, Fred Harris (the director of MITWE) was going through the semester’s important dates and logistics. It was all the typical stuff – CPW concert in April, no rehearsal on Presidents’ Day, etc. – until suddenly:!#@p!#@“There will also be no rehearsal on Wednesday, February 19. There will be a… special surprise… for us that day. I will say nothing more.”!#@p!#@I was very excited to hear this. Two years ago, Fred had also promised a “special surprise” that turned out to be a free week-long trip to the Amazon Rainforest over spring break. We got to perform in a bright pink opera house in the middle of the rainforest! But I was also a little suspicious. The most recent “special surprise” was a few days before classes started, when Fred informed the MITWE clarinets that we were scheduled to perform in the Sonic Jubilance concert in the second week of the semester. You never quite know what you’re getting into with Fred.!#@p!#@(In case you were wondering, the concert went great. Jeremy wrote a blog post about it yesterday that you should read.)!#@p!#@A week later, I received an email from the Music & Theater Arts (MTA) events office revealing the surprise. Jacob Collier (!) and Yo-Yo Ma (!!) were coming to MIT (!!!) to tape the pilot episode of some video-podcast-like series, and as an MTA student, I was invited to attend (!!!!). Talk about a crossover episode! It was very much the first kind of “special surprise” I was hoping for.!#@p!#@For context, Jacob Collier and Yo-Yo Ma are two incredibly talented, world-famous musicians:!#@p!#@Now, I know what you’re probably thinking. If these two musicians are so amazing and famous, what are they doing at MIT – a science and engineering school? Well firstly, MIT has a top-tier music program, thank you very much. But secondly, Jacob and Yo-Yo have surprisingly deep affiliations, both personal and professional, with MIT:!#@p!#@Admittedly, I wasn’t as big a Jacob Collier/Yo-Yo Ma fan as many of the other MIT students in attendance. I don’t listen to much cello music (I much prefer piano/clarinet music), and a lot of Jacob’s music is just a bit too avant-garde for me. Still, the taping was pretty incredible, and I am listening to a Yo-Yo Ma album on repeat as I write this post.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, we were strictly forbidden from filming or taking pictures during the taping, so I don’t have any pretty pictures or videos to show you. BUT! The production company did not (explicitly) ban pen and paper, so I sneakily wrote down notes the whole time.!#@p!#@There is definitely much to be desired in the quality of my notes, but in any case, here is my best approximation of what happened that evening:!#@p!#@(From here onward, I will omit the audience for clarity and also my own image editing sanity.)!#@p!#@In many of his performances, Jacob uses audience participation (usually through singing) as a tool to create music.!#@p!#@Then more opening remarks. Yo-Yo finally enters the concert hall after a brief introduction from Jacob. TL;DR: This event was meant to be a conversation between Jacob and Yo-Yo with audience participation sprinkled in between.!#@p!#@The fanboying back and forth went on for a solid five minutes.!#@p!#@I’m not joking, he actually said this pretty much verbatim.!#@p!#@The audience then spontaneously started whistling to imitate birds. It sounded like this but with people singing in the background and Jacob improvising fluttery chords on the piano. It felt rehearsed but wasn’t. (Fun fact: I never learned how to whistle before coming to MIT.)!#@p!#@Jacob and Yo-Yo were both child prodigies but were raised very differently. Suzie Collier, Jacob’s mother, always encouraged him to “be Jacob when [he] was a wee lad”. (He says “when I was wee lad” a lot because he’s British.)!#@p!#@(A four-octave vocal range is insane, by the way. Most people only have a three-octave range.)!#@p!#@They played the following two songs from Hush:!#@p!#@At this point, Yo-Yo decided to really lean into the “haha I am so old” part of his personality for some reason. He talked about how he met Bobby at Leonard Bernstein’s 70th birthday party (which was almost 40 years ago), before telling Jacob that he doesn’t know how the screen-record feature on iPhones works.!#@p!#@The audience member whose phone started ringing then hurriedly left out of embarrassment. Jacob wasn’t mocking them or anything though – you could tell he was totally prepared to start jamming out to the ringtone.!#@p!#@For a moment, I tuned out the conversation as I scribbled down notes on my paper. When I stopped writing, however, I was greeted by this new conversation:!#@p!#@Not sure what exactly led them here, but cool I guess.!#@p!#@A somewhat serious conversation ensued after this. Stuff about how rules are worth making so you can bend/break them (both in life and music). But then suddenly:!#@p!#@They played Gershwin’s Summertime for this jam session, with the audience choir singing chords in the background while Yo-Yo played the melody on his cello. Summertime is already a beautiful song by itself, so this was my highlight of the evening.!#@p!#@(Kind of ironic though, given how cold it was outside.)!#@p!#@At this point, we only had about ten minutes left, so there was some audience Q&A before the final jam session.!#@p!#@We ended the evening with the Dona Nobis Pacem canon – traditionally a short prayer for peace that ends a church service. What a fitting way to end an incredible evening!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-is-this-a-crossover-episode/
SONIC JUBILANCE by Jeremy W.,A day at the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building at MIT,by Jeremy W.,"February 22, 2025","Music has been part of MIT since the Institute’s earliest chapters. By 1884, 23 years after MIT was founded, the Banjo Club and the Glee Club had been officially launched. The October 22, 1884 issue of The Tech confirmed that, “An instrumental orchestra, consisting of first and second violins, violas, ‘cellos, flutes, first and second cornets, clarinet, trombone and double bass,” was in the process of forming, as well. On November 19, 1884, The Tech reported the first “official” musical space on the MIT campus (then located in Boston’s Back Bay):!#@p!#@Unfortunately, a year later the orchestra was disbanded due to lack of support, and for the next several decades—which marked MIT’s move from Boston to Cambridge—the MIT orchestra disbanded and reformed several times.!#@p!#@It wasn’t until 1947 with the transformational arrival of conductor Klaus Liepmann, MIT’s first first ever full-time music professor, that the foundation of MIT’s music program would begin to form. For the next quarter-century, Liepmann would put in motion a thriving music program at MIT, supported by funding from the Institute, that built the foundation for the world-class, conservatory-quality music program we have today.!#@p!#@On May 23, 1947, the revitalized MIT Symphony orchestra put on a spring concert. As reported by The Tech:!#@p!#@Ambitious, indeed. The program included Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 (featuring Arnold Judson ’47 as the soloist), Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, Mozart’s Symphony No. 35, and Strauss’s Kaiser-Walzer, Op. 437 (Emperor Waltz).!#@p!#@The orchestra performed in the auditorium of Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge (today known as Cambridge Rindge and Latin School). Six years later, MIT would break ground on Kresge Auditorium, the 1,200-seat performance hall and “meetinghouse of MIT.”!#@p!#@Fast-forward to 2025: the opening of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, the first facility on the MIT campus dedicated solely to music! Today, more than 1,500 MIT students take music classes each year, and hundreds of student musicians participate in one of MIT’s 30 performance ensembles—but until now, there has never been a centralized facility at MIT for music instruction, experimentation, and rehearsal.!#@p!#@More than 140 years since the Institute’s first orchestra gathered in the basement of a building in Boston’s Back Bay (and nearly 80 years since welcoming our first professor of music) we finally have a dedicated home to consolidate the rich variety of musical activities that take place at MIT. A cause for celebration!!#@p!#@To mark the historic opening of the Linde Music Building—and to kick off Artfinity: The MIT Festival of the Arts—MIT presented SONIC JUBILANCE, a performance featuring a range of vocal and instrumental ensembles spanning jazz, classical, and traditional music of Senegal and Bali. Set in the acoustically-immaculate Thomas Tull Concert Hall, the concert featured world premieres of four remarkable new pieces: John Harbison’s Two Noble Kinsmen, Charles Shadle’s Grace, Miguel Zenón’s Summit, and Keeril Makan’s Madrigal.!#@p!#@In the afternoon leading up to the much-anticipated SONIC JUBILANCE concert, the Linde Building opened its doors to the public for an open house, with performances by jazz and chamber ensembles and interactive workshops for Balinese Gamelan (led by Gusti Komin) and Senegalese drumming (led by Lamine Touré). I arrived at the Linde building at 1:30 PM, exploring the lobby that conjoins the facility’s three halls.!#@p!#@Even though I was early, I still wasn’t able to get a seat to the standing-room-only jazz performance held in the Jae S. and Kyuho Lim Music Maker Pavilion. Standing in the back didn’t detract from the experience at all; with the remarkable acoustics in the space I could hear every detail of each performer with striking clarity.!#@p!#@After the first piece in the jazz set, I snuck out to explore the Beatrice and Stephen Erdely Music and Culture Space. After first taking off my shoes (as instructed by the sign at the entrance) I slide into the hall to find Lamine Touré leading a West African drum workshop in the style of his renowned ensemble, Rambax MIT. I enjoyed the energizing sounds of the sabar drum beats for a few minutes before hopping across the lobby to the Thomas Tull Concert Hall to check in on the MIT Laptop Ensemble (FaMLE) soundcheck.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Jazz-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Rambax-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_FaMLE_Soundcheck-800x600.jpeg]!#@As a musician and sound nerd myself, I often enjoy soundchecks and rehearsals more than the performances themselves—so I was excited for the opportunity to observe FaMLE set up their rig in the new hall outfitted with an insane set of speakers. Here’s a quick compilation of some of the footage I grabbed while FaMLE ran their soundcheck.!#@p!#@During the FaMLE performance, director Ian Hattwick and his students experimented live using a few methods of digital music performance: generating music through code, looping music samples created live on pads and keyboards, and collaborating in real-time to produce lush sonic scapes that took full advantage of the surround-sound setup. Honestly, I could have gone home after this performance and been more than satisfied with the day.!#@p!#@My musical cup was already full just from the open house performances and workshops in the afternoon…but this was just the beginning. There were several more hours of music to enjoy later that evening at the main concert event.!#@p!#@Around 7 PM, my colleague Trinidad and I arrived back at the Linde Building just as a winter storm began to blanket Cambridge in snow. After we snagged great seats in the second row (behind all the Music and Theater Arts faculty!), I took a few minutes to explore the upper level of the hall.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Snow-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Program-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Upper-800x600.jpeg]!#@What unfolded for the next two hours was an overwhelming display of creativity and talent— and thankfully, you can enjoy a recording of the concert on both MIT’s Facebook page and the MIT Music and Theater Arts website.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Shadle-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Clarinets-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Zenon-and-Jazz-800x600.jpeg]!#@I did manage to capture a few moments on video, which I’ll share below. These clips include the world premiere of Summit by Grammy Award-winning, MacArthur Genius Miguel Zenón (timestamp 1:14:40 on the concert livestream), beautiful shadows cast by the MIT Wind Ensemble Flutes (timestamp 1:59:50), and the world premiere of Keeril Makan’s Madrigal, featuring violinist Natalie Lin-Douglas (timestamp 2:16:50). Madrigal was a clear highlight of the evening for me.!#@p!#@To introduce Madrigal before its world premiere, Keeril offered some remarks about the inspiration behind the piece:!#@p!#@The piece features Natalie Lin-Douglas as the solo violinist in the center of the stage, with several student musicians perched around the upper-level of the hall. Natalie is lit dramatically on four sides, casting a prismatic display of shadows around her, while the supporting musicians glow softly in the rafters above. As the soloist produces a succession of stark, percussive bursts and romantic lamentations, the musicians above repeat the same motifs, creating a disorienting surround-sound effect. Like the sculpture that inspired the piece, Madrigal has no clear static focal point, visually or aurally. Instead, a swirl of sound and light places each listener at their own sensory anchor point.!#@p!#@To me, Madrigal is the perfect metaphor for music at MIT: multi-voiced, always changing, and unique to every listener. And if history is any guide, music will continue to be a fundamental part of MIT in the chapters that lie ahead.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Jazz-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Rambax-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_FaMLE_Soundcheck-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Snow-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Program-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Upper-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Shadle-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Clarinets-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/W18_Zenon-and-Jazz-800x600.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/sonic-jubilance/
Fall 2024 🍂 by Fiona L. '27,"aka, things settle down.",by Fiona L. '27,"February 21, 2025","(12 units) 6.200 [Circuits] – I LOVE this class. Adam Hartz should legally adopt me. /hj I thought circuit theory was the coolest thing ever⁠01 , and I thought the weekly labs were even cooler than that. Every week, I’d mentally dread the labs, given that they were on a Friday afternoon, but I’d always come out of it with a cool device, feeling a sense that I’d really learned a lot in those three hours. My favorite thing I build has to be the light sensing robot, a robot created using light sensors and wheels that scurries away from light. I named my robot Adam Hartz, and Adam personally came to look at my robot 😳😳😳.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Z3fPoo3jREWmXMi7hivDiQ-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5jm1DWvvTo6cRauwGsIvWA.jpg]!#@(12 units) 6.191 [Computation Structures] – Amazing and intriguing content, but the lectures didn’t work that well with my learning style. I found it really cool to program in a hardware language, even though we didn’t get to work with hardware :( I appreciated the grading scheme for the class—fixed grade cutoffs with 20 “extra” points possible from a design project. Unlike some other classes, which were “”technically””⁠02 “graded on a curve”, there was no such thing in 6.191.!#@p!#@(12 units) 18.600 [Probability and Random Variables] – I was peer pressured into this by Jay B ’27. Although I didn’t get the chance to take this class with Professor Sheffield 03 , I still really enjoyed the content. The first third of the course was probability, which compared to the latter two thirds of the course, random variables, felt deceptively easy. Although I enjoyed the probability section better, I still liked learning about different kinds of distributions and ways to think about chance as a function.!#@p!#@(12 units) 21W.774 [The Art of Comic Book Writing] – I LOVED writing and drawing comics, although I definitely could’ve appreciated more grade transparency in this class. As an extra credit project for this class, I attended a panel where I got to meet the author of one of our assigned comic readings, and I bought a signed copy from him! I really liked each week’s readings, and I felt like I grew a lot from each writing assignment.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-10.17.28-PM-1400x1050.png]!#@(3 units) 8.A22 [Black Holes, the Accelerating Universe, the Disordered Cosmos] – This is an advising seminar I participated in as an associate advisor! I learned that despite how incredibly cool “astrophysics” sounded to me and how much I loved Physics 1 / Mechanics, astrophysics might not be that fun. But was made this class worth it was the discussions, and how Prof. Ed used its two readings (Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” and Chandra Prescod-Winestein’s “The Disordered Cosmos”) to defty weave together a dialogue about physics and social justice.!#@p!#@(6 units, dropped) 16.632 [Intro to Autonomous Machines] – For some reason, this class didn’t jibe with me like 6.200 did. Although I appreciated the chance to build, I personally didn’t like the pace of the class, and preferred a class that went into both theory and hardware, like 6.200 did. I originally chose this class because I wanted to be in NEET⁠04 , and had a mini internal crisis during the middle of the semester where I struggled to decide whether or not to stay in NEET.!#@p!#@Paid Notetaker – A paid notetaker position was offered for both 6.191 and 6.200. I took both of these positions, thinking to myself “I’m going to come to class anyways, so why not get paid for it.” Paid notetaking is a pretty good opportunity when it gets offered, and it’s typically more likely to be offered for larger classes like 191 and 200, since the notes you take get sent (anonymously) to a student with a DAS (Disability and Access Services) request.!#@p!#@Blogging – My first semester of blogging! I was so excited about this, given that I didn’t apply to the blogs as an incoming freshman because “I’d never get in!” and then proceeded to spend my entire freshman year daydreaming about being a blogger and idolizing all the bloggers and mentally planning out everything I’d blog about if I were a blogger. I loved attending blogger meeting every other Wednesday and getting to know all the other creative, quirky, and deeply caring souls of the blogger page :) (and Petey et al. I guess) I felt like I wanted to blog about every little thing that happened to me, but what actually happened was that the busyness of the semester made!#@p!#@ESP⁠05 – I wasn’t as involved with ESP this semester, since Splash, the program that I was directing, was postponed to Spring semester. However, I still stopped by a week of Cascade (ESP’s Spring Program) and came to meetings.!#@p!#@Amphibious Achievement⁠06 – I was also peer pressured into this by Jay B ’27. I had a really good time with this club—I spent Sunday mornings as an “academic mentor” (Amphibious Achievement offered the opportunity to be an academic and/or athletic mentor), going through lessons with kids, and helping them on whatever school work they had that week. Me and my mentee were both in a sticker-making workshop, where we learned concepts in graphic design, marketing, and ordering custom products. Working with the kids every week was a delight I could count on every weekend, and I loved learning more about their lives and interests. When we were short on mentors, I sometimes worked with Jay’s mentee—I learned more about his interest in guitar, and recommended him uBlock origin⁠07 , which he said removed “99% of his ads.”!#@p!#@Along the way, I checked out some other extracurriculars, such as attending some meetings of Arcturus, a build team, and trying out for a dance team, although I never ended up sticking with them.!#@p!#@-many organizations sent rejection letters into my inbox. :(!#@p!#@-I feel like I did less “cool things” in my free time than in other semesters? It’s very very hard to find the time for it though :( I did spend time decorating my room though!!#@p!#@-most people don’t maintain a 5.0 forever, and the amount of people with one decreases every semester!#@p!#@-STUDY STUDY STUDY for tests. always.!#@p!#@– doing homework in advance⁠08 is a very good thing!#@p!#@-tell people you’re going to be late if you are (maybe this is just for me, given my tendency to be chronically late to everything)!#@p!#@-never let the desire to get good grades block out your love of learning. viewing my classes through the lens of “learning” was the most surefire way to shift my attitude from “i must persevere this challenge” to “i want to learn this new cool thing.”!#@p!#@-a good sleep schedule is the cornerstone of everything, whether it be a good mood, focus/attention span, health, not feeling like your life is out of control, and not feeling horrible all the time.!#@p!#@-a good recitation leader can make a big difference!#@p!#@-This year, I seemed to find new friendships in the most surprising places, whether it be 6.200 lab hours or 4am in a lounge. Although I feel like upperclassmen aren’t as desperate for friends as freshmen are, I feel like that’s a good thing, in a sense? That way, I let myself get to know people I really resonated with.!#@p!#@-Going on a duck tour with my advising group!!#@p!#@-Taking my RPM kids to Franklin Park Zoo’s light show! It was hard to make happen, especially since the program would not cover an Uber to the zoo. We had to take public transit there, and I was afraid of getting the route wrong. The lights were really beautiful! I was really happy, since I feel like I was able to exceed the freshmens’ expectations of the event.!#@p!#@-MY MOM CAME OVER FOR FAMILY WEEKEND!!! AND SHE ATE THE STIR FRY I MADE!!! AND SAID IT WAS GOOD!!!!#@p!#@-Taking people to visit my pink and cute room :)!#@p!#@-People enjoying my pink and cute room :)!#@p!#@-Saw SIX the musical!!!!#@p!#@-Attended PP Phormal and BC Formal. PP Formal was in an F1 Arcade. I tried racing and came in second to last place. :’(!#@p!#@-Seeing quaint New England towns [Kennebunksport, Ogunquit, Portsmouth] decked out for Christmas! Along the way, my friends and I also saw a giant gingerbread house in the lobby of Wentworth by the Sea.!#@p!#@-I tried a bunch of new food places, from Fire + Ice (a hibachi place in Boston) to Ripple Cafe (right next to campus) to Pho Basil to Shabu Zen Hotpot (and more!!!!)!#@p!#@-Becoming a Friend of the Ohms, visiting the Ohms’ performance at UMass along with Jay B ’27, and trying to decide which famline to be incorporated into.!#@p!#@-Eating at Al’s French Fry!#@p!#@-Breaking my old phone 😭 09!#@p!#@-Not succeeding in converting people to 21W at a SHASS event :(!#@p!#@-The time I saw a RAT⁠10 in my room and I had to call Unit 12 to get rid of it and some lady with rat traps⁠11 came and we spent a bunch of time banging everything in the room together at 3am⁠12 . The woman was really nice, although the horror of finding a rat in my room places this firmly in “bad memories.” After banging everything a bunch of times, we figured that the rat must have already left. At that very moment, the rat scurried out of my room.!#@p!#@-During the 6.200 final exam, I took a makeup exam with 2 other people. I was terrified to find that there was a packet with REAL CIRCUIT COMPONENTS on our desks. I was pretty psyched out going into the exam, although I got the circuit to work in the end! 13 Afterwards, I walked out of the room and into a winter wonderland—apparently, the first day of real snow was the last day of finals season. I spent the entire day coping from my finals while simultaneously being enamored with the snow in a way only a Californian could be.!#@p!#@-Sneaking into Next Dining in order to obtain milk for mango lassi.!#@p!#@-Going to Vermont with some of my friends to see the Ben and Jerry Ice Cream factory. There was a sign at the end that promised free samples of broccoli cheddar ice cream. That turned out to be just a prank :(((((( Which made me sad because I was really really interested in seeing what broccoli cheddar ice cream tasted like. The leaves in Vermont were all dead because we had ventured into Upper New England too late, but it was undoubtedly a bonding experience. The whole time, we were racing against the clock because two people on the trip (me included) had a Next Haunt run that very night at 10pm.!#@p!#@-Meeting the most brainrotted individuals at UPenn AND Brown. I went to Philadelphia during Indigenous Peoples’ Day Weekend and was welcomed into a living group that put pictures of wolves on their doors. There was a picture on the wall of the suite that we referred to as “The Sigma.” Four days couldn’t have felt shorter as we explored Philadelphia, did laundry, had a picnic, and played “Red Flags”, a card game where players attach ridiculous “red flags” onto fictional partners together. There was also a UPenn shower curtain there. (In the future I aim to meet the most brainrotted individuals from EVERY school, just for the memes.)!#@p!#@-The phrase “skull emoji” being the most commonly used phrase between me and my friends.!#@p!#@-Getting addicted to Vester Cafe, due to their marketing techniques which I was very susceptible to⁠14 , their insanely good strawberry matcha, and the fact that certain people I knew were always there!!#@p!#@This semester seemed a lot more stable than the semesters before. I had started off the year already mentally used to college life and living in a dorm and the intensity of social life in college, so it wasn’t completely overwhelming like in freshman year. I had learned how much commitment was “too much,” so I wasn’t completely overwhelmed all the time.!#@p!#@When I look back to this semester, I think about a car driving down a road peppered with leaves. Maybe the same car that I was in when I saw the Ohms perform at UMass Amherst. Sometimes the road was bumpy, and the speed limits rose and fell as the road thinned, twisted, became slick with ice. But there was always solid ground to drive on, always the lines in the road for me to follow. I had all the “mental framework” of college that I had developed in the past year of floundering around and feeling overwhelmed. Things have calmed down, and I’m really glad for that.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xSGgM_cqS4WU5_cW06Xibw-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vsILnwU1SyW1GJIz3WM8_w-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vqsD4j_cRSSNSeuA5mNy5Q-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kVc1h69_RkKAG1pPWXwGVA.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP-qqK7CSZCcDjaQlxq1oA-800x1200.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Z3fPoo3jREWmXMi7hivDiQ-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/5jm1DWvvTo6cRauwGsIvWA.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-10.17.28-PM-1400x1050.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/xSGgM_cqS4WU5_cW06Xibw-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vsILnwU1SyW1GJIz3WM8_w-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vqsD4j_cRSSNSeuA5mNy5Q-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kVc1h69_RkKAG1pPWXwGVA.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP-qqK7CSZCcDjaQlxq1oA-800x1200.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/fall-2024/
a house tour of mit sororities! by Emiko P. '25,"meet aphi, axo, and theta",by Emiko P. '25,"February 21, 2025","Welcome to a tour of three MIT sorority houses!

small changes feeling big by Kanokwan T. '25,my winter in Armenia,by Kanokwan T. '25,"February 17, 2025","Every IAP, I travel.!#@p!#@I can’t help it. There’s this wanderlust gremlin in me that’s always eager to experience new places. Access to global experiences is one of the reasons I chose this MIT, especially because I didn’t have access to them growing up. I dreamt of seeing worlds beyond my own.!#@p!#@So, I must confess: before this trip, I didn’t know much about Armenia. But, that’s largely why I chose it. There was an allure: what was this place really like?!#@p!#@I was there to teach a renewable energy course at TUMO with my friend Caitlin O. ’25. We taught students how to CAD, circuit-build, and code—culminating in a solar-powered night light. The project was very cute and a good means to pick up skills. The experience was fun for what it was, though an unexpected hurdle came up. Caitlin, unfortunately, fell very ill the 2nd day, so I had to learn some of her material and teach 9 out of the 10 days mostly on my own. (don’t worry, she’s doing much better now) Thankfully, TUMO pairs teachers from abroad with teaching assistants/translators, which was especially helpful since many students didn’t speak English and I had to teach solo on the fly. Despite the challenges, the students’ enthusiasm made the experience all the more rewarding. I found myself always bouncing around the classroom answering questions from eager kids. And their final projects were mad cool.!#@p!#@I lived in the capital city: Yerevan. Our teaching program also covered a day trip out to rural Dilijan.⁠01 A solid mix of fast and slow places.

How I got recruited to play D3 soccer at MIT by Emiko P. '25,the college sports recruiting process,by Emiko P. '25,"February 16, 2025","The college recruiting process can be a confusing world to maneuver for athletes and their families. The soccer recruiting process, while definitely intimidating and tiring at times, ended up being a great decision for me, as I spent all four years of college playing D3 soccer on MIT’s Women’s Soccer team! I was the first in my family of four kids (who all play soccer) to get recruited, so I definitely have advice for other student-athletes interested in MIT or in playing college soccer in general.!#@p!#@I’m a senior in college now, meaning I did my recruiting process between 2018 and 2021, so keep in mind that some of my experience may be outdated. This is how I went about the college recruiting process for soccer, and how I eventually committed to MIT. I’m not entirely sure how other sports get recruited at MIT (or at other schools, for that matter), but hopefully some of the overall principles and advice can still apply!!#@p!#@I just want to quickly say that doing any of the things I suggest below are not necessary. I know many girls on the soccer team that did the sort of thing I did – ECNL/ GA club showcases and big recruiting events – and also others who had never played in front of the coach in person before showing up to pre-season. The journey is not the same for everyone and following this advice does not guarantee anything, but for me, these tips are all things that I found to make a difference in my recruiting process. If I had to do it all over again, I personally would do the tips I’ve laid out below.!#@p!#@That’s all I have for now! Wishing everyone the best of luck in the recruiting process, and I hope you find the school of your dreams :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-16-at-15.47.59_cdc4d8dd-400x300.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-16-at-15.47.59_cdc4d8dd-400x300.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-i-got-recruited-to-play-d3-soccer-at-mit/
Polymer Police by Andi Q. '25,Using spectroscopy to prove my mom wrong (except she was right and I was actually wrong oops),by Andi Q. '25,"February 16, 2025","Yesterday, my mom had some “silk” scarves shipped to me so I could bring them back home after graduation. She was very excited about them, telling me how happy all her friends would be when she gave them these “100% pure silk” scarves as gifts. However, I was skeptical of these scarves as soon as I unboxed them. The packaging was incredibly suspicious, with the scarves arriving in a box that literally said “CHEMICAL TEXTILE” in big bold letters. They also didn’t look or feel like other silk fabrics I was used to. Plus, my mom ordered them on the internet, where anyone can say whatever they want.!#@p!#@I was convinced that these scarves were made of some synthetic textile like polyester, while my mom was convinced that “of course it’s real silk, Andi, why would anyone on the internet lie to you”. Short of having her come to MIT and feel the fabric herself, there was little arguing I could do to change her mind. Clearly, I needed a scientific test to determine conclusively what material the scarves were made of.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, by far the most common scientific test for silk is to… burn the fabric⁠01 . I couldn’t possibly do that! Damaging the scarves in any way was out of the question, given that they might be made of real silk and my mom would be very sad if I burned her merchandise. I also didn’t want to cause a fire alarm and have everyone in my dorm freeze to death in the Boston cold.!#@p!#@But then inspiration struck. MIT has tons of high-tech lab tools for characterizing materials. What if I just used one of those tools to find the polymer structure of the fabric? Conveniently, MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering created the Breakerspace a year ago so that undergrads like me can use these tools for this exact purpose. Spectroscopy⁠02 doesn’t lie, so my mom would have to believe me after seeing the evidence!!#@p!#@Selecting the right tool to use was surprisingly difficult. Like the burn test, most of the tools would end up damaging the scarves in some way. For example, X-ray diffraction would involve grinding the fabric into a powder before irradiating it with X-rays, and Raman spectroscopy would involve shining a powerful laser onto the fabric (which would probably burn a hole into it). An electron microscope wouldn’t damage the fabric (although it would require me to cut out a small patch) and would tell me its chemical composition but wouldn’t reveal anything about the bonding structure, so that wouldn’t work either.!#@p!#@Luckily, the Breakerspace has the perfect tool for the job after all! Meet the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer:!#@p!#@The FTIR spectrometer works by shining infrared light onto a material and then measuring how much the material absorbs/transmits the light at different wavelengths. The resulting spectrum can then be used to identify the material because sharp changes in absorbance/transmittance correspond to specific bonds between atoms. This happens because molecules are like balls (atoms) joined together with springs (bonds), and so the speed at which each ball can wiggle (and thus which wavelengths of light the wiggling absorbs) is dictated by how heavy the ball is and how many springs are attached to it.!#@p!#@For example, here are the FTIR spectra of silk and polyester:!#@p!#@And here are their polymer structures:!#@p!#@Silk’s FTIR spectrum (left) has a big dip that polyester’s spectrum (right) does not have. This dip is due to an oxygen-hydrogen bond stretching, which silk has (on the green part of the structure) but polyester does not have. Other differences between the two polymers (for example, silk has nitrogen while polyester has that hexagonal ring structure) contribute further to the differences between the spectra. Very cool stuff,⁠03 but I digress.!#@p!#@Anyway, the FTIR spectrometer was perfect for this little experiment for several important reasons:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0316.png]!#@So what did I find using the spectrometer?!#@p!#@Well…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/silk-vs-polyester-800x412.png]!#@The scarf’s FTIR spectrum almost perfectly matched that of silk! For good measure, I also collected an FTIR spectrum of a 100% polyester shirt, which also matched the expected spectrum. Great news for my mom, because the scarves were genuine as she had hoped.!#@p!#@… so I was wrong. Oops. Not quite the mic-drop ending I was hoping for, but oh well. I guess the moral of this story is to trust everything on the internet, because why would anyone on the internet lie to you.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0316.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/silk-vs-polyester-800x412.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/polymer-police/

I’m taking three technicals this semester, and if there’s one thing they all have in common, it’s that they’re gonna make you WRITE.!#@p!#@5.12 – Organic Chemistry!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stereoisomers.jpeg-800x1256.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-800x1144.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-2-800x1423.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-3-800x1409.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-4-800x529.png]!#@I do enjoy this class and it has gotten me more into chemistry, but lectures are lowkey (highkey) bad. The structure of the class really is made to give students as many materials to learn as possible, which is noble but very messy. Every class, there are slides posted, plus an extra notes sheet that has some of the info on the slides (but not all of it?). Already, I don’t know if I should take my own notes, write on the slides, or write on the notes handout. Then the professor writes on the blackboard during class, none of which is put onto the slides/notes handout. You would think this would mean you should take your own notes, but a TA is actually taking all the notes and posting them after, leaving three (3) different files for notes for every lecture, all with different amounts of material.!#@p!#@On top of this, a lot of the stuff I feel like I should takes notes on are definitional, but the professor just reads all of the definitions as fast as possible at the beginning of each lecture so “we know what’s coming”, instead of doing it logically by introducing a definition as it comes up in the lecture. I’ve found the textbook to be most helpful and the notes more as a catch-up than a comprehensive guide.!#@p!#@7.03 – Genetics!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-800x1001.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-2-800x1473.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-3-800x1005.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pedigrees-2.jpeg-2-800x1196.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pedigrees-2.jpeg-3-800x1337.png]!#@This class has an all-around better note structure than 5.12, but because the class tries to derive a lot of ideas through various test and trains of thought, sometimes the professor will go back in a different color to a table/chart/cross we ran earlier in lecture and update it/show what we proved/changed. This is really effective when learning, but it does result in me frantically trying to drag and drop different parts of my notes on my IPad so I have space to edit.!#@p!#@8.02 – Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-1-800x1459.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-2-800x1526.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-4-800x1302.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-5-800x1700.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-3-800x1099.png]!#@Just like 8.01,⁠01 this class is taught in the TEAL/flipped-learning style, with lecture videos at home replacing lectures, and “lectures” being practice problems/review with a professor and TAs. Most of my “notes” are coming from the at-home learning-sequences, of which all of the videos are free to view online through MIT OCW!⁠02 Because class is review and we do practice problems at whiteboards, I feel like I normally don’t have that much to write, but I end up having just enough to make a little section that is adding nothing to the aesthetic (major peeve).!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stereoisomers.jpeg-800x1256.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-800x1144.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-2-800x1423.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-3-800x1409.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Conformational-Isomers.jpeg-4-800x529.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-800x1001.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-2-800x1473.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Recombination-and-Genetic-Maps.jpeg-3-800x1005.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pedigrees-2.jpeg-2-800x1196.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pedigrees-2.jpeg-3-800x1337.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-1-800x1459.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-2-800x1526.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-4-800x1302.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-5-800x1700.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Week-2.jpeg-3-800x1099.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/notes-from-a-week-of-new-classes/
Electrical Engineering V-Day Doodles by Anika H. '26,are you feeling the spark?,by Anika H. '26,"February 14, 2025",,,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/electrical-engineering-v-day-doodles/
[guest blog] y(I)APping by Fiona L. '27,nothing crazy just another IAP blog,by Fiona L. '27,"February 13, 2025","This is a guest post by one of my friends, Heidi Z. ’27, one of the first friends I made here at MIT and my favorite “homegrown massachusettsian”. (shoutout DEAPS ’23!) As stated in this post, IAP is one of the most unique, liminal pockets of time at MIT, showing that a month can contain multitudes. I really hope you enjoy learning more about what a January at MIT can look like—I know I sure did :)!#@p!#@Hi, I’m Heidi Z. ‘27, a sophomore double majoring in 6 and 18⁠01 at MIT! In high school, I loved browsing the blogs and imagining a future in Cambridge—having the opportunity to come full circle is honestly surreal. My favorite blogs were always just about how MIT students spent their days in classes, clubs, or hobbies, so I figured I would share something similar about this past IAP⁠02 !!#@p!#@You might wonder, how much can you really accomplish in IAP?—turns out, quite a lot! Of course, everyone spends it differently and this was just what I found to be the best for me. I spent my last IAP not doing much and ended up feeling pretty sluggish going into the spring semester, so I decided to change it up this year. In this post, I’ll first cover some of the things I did and then present some surprising reflections I had about the whole journey.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3890-800x799.jpeg]!#@This opportunity was actually organized by Harvard’s Science Olympiad club—high school SciOly was what introduced me to geology and earth science, so it was refreshing to take a break from math and CS to revisit that passion. Over the fall semester, we organized a two-stage exam for students across India, culminating in a five-day in-person camp for the top 100 competitors!!#@p!#@I flew into New Delhi with six other undergrads, none of us having been to India before. After two days of touring Delhi and Agra, we headed to the host university, living in dorms for a week while proctoring exams across five science disciplines and running hands-on workshops. As the resident earth scientist of the group, I wrote and proctored the earth science exam and taught workshops on climate change and rock/mineral identification. Earth science is often overshadowed by subjects like chemistry and biology, so I was pleased to see the students genuinely engaged in my workshops. I even gave away the majority of my mineral collection—seeing the students’ faces light up as they carried home a piece of vanadinite made it worth it 04 .!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4-800x800.jpeg]!#@Besides interacting with students, I loved bonding with my fellow undergraduate mentors. Whether it was staying up late in our dorm room “working”, introducing Harvard students to MIT lingo, or enduring the horrors of Cat Mario⁠05 , I couldn’t have asked for a better group of people to spend a week with in a foreign country. Turns out Harvard kids aren’t that peculiar! Some of them can be kind of okay…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/5-800x800.jpeg]!#@After my time in India, I landed in Chicago to visit my cousins and to attend an insight program at a quantitative finance company. These programs are great—they fly you out, give you a tour of the office, and introduce you to the industry. Sophomore year is a great time to explore and consider various careers, so attending events like this is really fun! Over the course of three days, we were introduced to both the trading and technology sectors of a quantitative finance company through simulations, chats with employees, and presentations/lectures. I especially loved shadowing traders and watching them work in real time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1.png-2.png-3.png-4.png-5.png-6-800x800.jpeg]!#@What made this experience even better was that it was a women’s-only program, creating an incredibly supportive environment. I connected with some amazing women that I’ll hopefully get to meet again soon! And stepping outside the MIT bubble was honestly relieving. People were mostly amazed that we hadn’t started our spring semester yet while I really enjoyed learning more about the culture and customs at other universities.!#@p!#@I decided to make a stop in New York City after realizing I have free will as a college student—I’ve never been on my own before. I stayed with an MIT friend who had graduated last spring, so it was also awesome to see him again! Catching up with friends is always fun.!#@p!#@Having no responsibilities for this period of time, I wanted to do all the classic tourist activities. As someone who has recently become a big musical fan: I watched & Juliet⁠06 and Little Shop of Horrors⁠07 . Money-saving tip: try getting rush and/or lottery tickets! I was able to see both for <100 dollars total with great seats! I also visited the Met and MoMA and devoured a ton of delicious food at the expense of my bank account.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2-800x800.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3-800x800.jpeg]!#@Back at MIT, it was prep week for MIT Science Olympiad! Every IAP, we bring ~1000 high school students to campus for one of the most competitive invitationals nationwide. The planning committee (PC) consists of ~30 undergrads who organize logistics, and we also have around ~40 event supervisors who write and proctor events. It’s an unforgettable experience and I’m always amazed that teams from as far as California and Hawaii appreciate our tournament.!#@p!#@This year, I really got to know my fellow PC members. There were a lot more people on campus than last year, so the work was quicker, the conversations were livelier, and the tournament ran smoother. Week-of could be hellish in the sheer amount of manual labor needed to be performed, but it’s so worth it in the end. The day of, we got up at 5:30AM and wrapped around around 11pm — my job as Publicity Head was basically manning the t-shirt booth for eight hours straight while giving directions to hundreds of lost high schoolers. I also co-hosted the Memes/Kahoot section of the awards ceremony, which was a nerve-wracking but fun experience! The day was exhausting but so rewarding—I wouldn’t change a thing.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/6-800x800.jpeg]!#@Less structured activities that I took part in:!#@p!#@As a nerdy, academically-focused high schooler, my social life in high school was definitely on the quieter side. Similar to many MIT students I’ve talked to, I had a small group of like-minded friends that I mostly kept to (but still love dearly). The most student-body-wide recognition I got was being dubbed “Best Brains” or something in our high school’s superlative contest…!#@p!#@Transitioning to college, I definitely struggled a lot initially: I watched friend groups form without me, events occur without my knowledge, and the hustle and bustle of MIT continue without my inclusion — even at MIT, being an introvert is not easy. After my first year, I thought I had learned to keep up with the constant rhythm of MIT. Unfortunately, a series of events led to difficulties both academically and socially last semester.!#@p!#@My initial goal for this IAP was to put the previous semesters behind me. I wanted to focus on the activities and classes I had signed up for – this was going to be strictly for myself. And in that sense, IAP by all accounts was quite a success! (yay)!#@p!#@But when I think back to the past month, I don’t actually think about the sheer number of events I attended; I think about the incredibly cool people I had the privilege of yIAPping to. The conversations I had and the unplanned moments of connection with a diverse array of people were so valuable that I honestly I don’t know what to make of it—it seems I only found so much social fulfillment by accident and spontaneity? In previous semesters, I put so much time and effort into deliberately trying to form friendships, while this supposed period of solo adventure turned into precisely the opposite.!#@p!#@To me, IAP has always represented a chance to explore, step outside the usual routine, and take on experiences that become nearly impossible once classes start. But this time, I learned that, despite the name, you don’t actually have to do it independently! Looking back, going the entire month without engaging in social activities would have felt pretty lonely.!#@p!#@More broadly, I guess what I’m taking away from this IAP is that there’s a balance to be found between actively working toward your goals and embracing unexpected opportunities? Taking life just a little less seriously (in both social and academic contexts) seemed to work well for me. Obviously, I can’t expect every month to go the same way as IAP did, but I’ll try to take the memories and learning experiences with me as I navigate the remaining semesters I have here.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3890-800x799.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4-800x800.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/5-800x800.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1.png-2.png-3.png-4.png-5.png-6-800x800.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2-800x800.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3-800x800.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/6-800x800.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-blog-yiapping/
UROP reveal!! by Aiden H. '28,it's like a gender reveal but important,by Aiden H. '28,"February 11, 2025","It was inevitable. My MIT prophecy has been fulfilled. There was no path to nor desire for avoidance. I’ve started doing research.⁠01 Mind you, how could I not? Over 90% of MIT students will UROP⁠02 at some point, and January is just too dark and depressing for me not to have something to stress over. And as much as I have kept my blog-persona STEM-free and relatively non-nerdy in order to preserve the major amounts of street cred I have, I fear it must be discussed.!#@p!#@Late last semester, I sent in a bunch of UROP applications on ELx⁠03 and cold-emailed some labs to try and have a UROP for IAP⁠04 and spring, and wasn’t even met with rejection, just plain non-response.⁠05 One PhD student did respond though, we met a couple times before winter break to discuss what a project could look like, and now we meet once a week while I show him all of my data and explains to me what it means and what I need to do with it.!#@p!#@So, for the past month (and the rest of the semester), all of my non-class related energy is being put to my first UROP.!#@p!#@Without further ado, my project is…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hand-mouse-cursor-clicks-the-reveal-secret-button-vector-21125086-800x864.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-09-at-5.02.02 PM-800x795.png]!#@As a prospective 6-7⁠06 (or 10-B,⁠07 we’ll see), this project is actually very relevant and pretty much what a lot of computational biologists are spending they’re time doing doing right now, which is cool because I feel important, but scary because I feel stupid compared to the other PhD people doing this.!#@p!#@From what I’ve heard (although it just generally varies greatly from project to project), this is a fairly unique UROP experience/project/dyanmic? And I’m loving it. While a lot of CS and/or bio UROPs are a part of a much larger project and a group of PhD students, often with multiple UROP students per project or group of projects, mine is just this one PhD student walking me through a short project from beginning to end on whatever we found interesting. Instead of having to acclimate to a lab that has been running for years, I got to go through data selection and project design individually with my mentor, and I’m the only person responsible for actually doing any of the lab (running the code, making the graphs, etc. etc.). This last part is especially freeing because I’m not rushing to match other people’s deadlines, so if I’m slammed one week there’s not any major repercussions.!#@p!#@With the lore and details out of the way, it’s time to get serious.!#@p!#@⚠️⚠️ WARNING: MILDLY INTENSE SCIENCE AHEAD⁠08 ⚠️⚠️!#@p!#@The crux of the project is something that is pretty common throughout comp bio right now as a result of developments towards free-to-use AI for microbiology. Basically, why wait millennia for nature to spurt out better proteins when I could try thousands of possibilities on my computer right now? I won’t go too much into the background of this issue or how it’s currently being solved, but this Veritasium video that was just posted explains everything very well if you’re interested or need a bio refresher.!#@p!#@The project is being mentally split into three stages:!#@p!#@So far, I’m working on parts 1 and 2, with 1 mostly done.!#@p!#@My advisor and I⁠09 decided on starting with studying Cytochrome P450, a gigantic protein family that is easily accessible, large enough to sample, and well studied (as well as, like, biologically important but aren’t kinda most enzymes?).!#@p!#@I started by using UniProt, an online protein database, and searched the Cytochrome P450 family. The data in UniProt is organized hierarchically; family –> cluster –> sequence. Searching the P450 family lists clusters, which are just groups of sequences, big or small, that are found to be similar enough on an amino acid level, but all individually create one of the proteins in the Cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 has >1,000,000 different clusters, so I used UniRef50 (a program/search tool inside UniProt) that simplifies the sequences based on similarity. With a similarity of 90% or 100% (UniRef90 or UniRef100), sequences will be counted if they are 90% or 100% unique, respectively, leaving more sequences. UniRef50 only leaves sequences that are at least 50% unique,  and I make the assumption that sequences that are over 50% similar will have nearly identical structures in the end. This is a typical time vs accuracy tradeoff (I as one person cannot run 1,000,000 sequences, but running that many would technically be more accurate in the end).!#@p!#@This leaves >90,000 clusters. From here, I downloaded sequences from the top 10 clusters with the most sequences.  Amino acid sequences are downloaded as .fasta files, which are formatted with a “>” followed by the sequence name, and then the amino acid sequence on the following line.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-5.51.48 PM-400x141.png]!#@From there I randomly sampled 100 sequences from each cluster file, leaving me with 1000 sequences across 10 clusters that, after all the parsing, should be representative of the sequence population of >1,000,000.!#@p!#@Side note: You’ll save a bunch of time if you remember to check that there are no repeat sequences after you sample and not after you have a bunch of data already and it’s like 1:00 A.M. and you’re pissed! 🎉🎉!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-30-at-3.01.46 PM-400x247.png]!#@After this, I downloaded localcolabfold to run AlphaFold 2 (AF, henceforth), an AI system created by Google’s DeepMind that famously solved Levinthal’s paradox.⁠10 Since my MacBook doesn’t have the computing capacity to carry out running an AI system of this scale to any capacity, I secure shell log in to a GPU provided by MIT. Every time I ssh in, it gives me a cute picture:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-5.26.48 PM-800x378.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-9.17.14 PM-800x591.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-31-at-7.21.03 PM-800x559.png]!#@Once I have access to the GPU, I run AF and get met with what can only be described as a shit ton of stuff.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-24-at-10.55.33 PM-400x260.png]!#@I had AF set to run 5 “recycles” of each sequence, meaning that each sequence is run 5 times, each prediction theoretically getting stronger (as it has the information of the previous cycles). Most importantly, I get a pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) score for each cycle the sequence is run. This higher the pLDDT score (>80, mostly), the more accurate the prediction, and the AF output can be assumed to be nearly identical to what the actual protein would look like.!#@p!#@📣📣 Don’t underestimate or under-appreciate this! A computer was literally just given a list of capital letters and it’s accurately predicting how the basis of most microbiology folds and forms!! 📣📣!#@p!#@These pLDDT scores also give me a bunch of other files, most of which aren’t desperately important for me to explain. One fun one, though, is .pdb files, which give me the structure prediction. Using a separate software (Visual Molecular Dynamics), I can upload the file and mess around the with shape. When I get bored I treat it like MS Paint but for biomolecules.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-2.03.34 PM-1-400x369.png]!#@Another important output is the .json files, which pair sequence-pLDDT as keys-values in a dictionary. This allows me to run the next part, Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), a huge⁠11 model made by ex-Meta scientists. This is a transformer-based language model that allows me to turn the sequences into numerical data, vectorize them all into a huge array, and start to look at the differences between each of the clusters. This also gives me cute, encouraging messages.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-10.58.41 PM-800x424.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-8.10.31 PM-800x487.png]!#@Eventually⁠12 I will graph all of these to visualize exactly how representative my samples are of the population (color the original P450 and the cluster sequences differently, and see if I can see any of the original color). I will also start running the “mutation” part of the plan in the coming weeks, running an already created generative algorithm that mutates by essentially “swapping” amino acid sequences. I will choose a specific part of the sequence that two sequences share, and have everything before that point on the sequences stay as their original, and the rest switch. Since I’m trying to hone the active sites of the enzymes, I will have to find markers in the sequences that represent the amino acids that describe the shape of the active site, and chose this as the point for ESM to run.

SSP by Ellie F. '28,aka summer science program aka summer sleep program aka silly science people aka summer solstice pset aka,by Ellie F. '28,"February 10, 2025","Sophomore year was a lonely one for me. After a full year of virtual school, I had lost touch with many of my middle school friends, and I was slowly realizing that I had no one to talk to about 3blue1brown or NASA missions or programming challenges. My SSP application, then, was a plea for connection, a desire to meet people outside of the bubble I was in.!#@p!#@Any fears I might have had about fitting in or finding friends were dashed within an hour of my arrival. I had just finished unpacking, and my room was missing a trash can. I went downstairs to find one, and instead found myself chatting with a few other students as time fell away. By dinnertime, the entire downstairs common room was filled with new people and bright, easy conversation. I found out later that my mom, after waiting half an hour for me to return, had just gone and gotten the trash can herself.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-day-1-2-1000x750.jpg]!#@In my six weeks at SSP, my priority was to make as many memories with my new friends as possible. On weekdays, those of us willing to get up for breakfast would play Wordle and its dozens of variants. After all our lectures for the day, we’d pile into the computer lab to pset, singing songs from West Side Story and Hadestown as we worked, and taking breaks to doodle on the board. We’d laugh about the scenarios on our psets or just commiserate over the hardest parts. In the evenings, once I was done with my work, I’d go back to the dorm and sink into the couch and talk and talk and talk until silent time, and then whisper until the TAs told us to go to our rooms. If my team was observing at night, we’d gossip and swap music tastes as we waited for exposures in the tiny, dark observatory in the foothills of a desert mountain.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekday-1-800x1472.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekday-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekday-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekday-4-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-obs-0-800x599.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-obs-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-obs-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-obs-4-800x600.jpg]!#@On Saturdays, we’d pile into a bus to Walmart, which, in our tiny New Mexico town, was a destination akin to Disneyland. Precious free time went to a pool trip, or exploring the on-campus geology museum, or worshipping a second-edition copy of Newton’s Principia Mathematica in the library. When we found out that the tiny one-room theater was showing the new Minions movie, we all walked a mile under the hot desert sun in our formalwear, feeling like we were in some teen summer movie, except one where the characters also tracked asteroids across the sky for fun. Sunday evenings were movie nights, where we’d make popcorn and watch classic science fiction films, calling out the astronomy jargon we were now familiar with, cheering when Socorro, New Mexico, our home away from home, was featured in Contact.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekend-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekend-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekend-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekend-4-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ssp-weekend-5-800x1067.jpg]!#@On my last observation shift, the sky was the darkest and clearest I had ever seen. After we set up exposures for the Eagle Nebula, my friends and I laid down on the sidewalk outside the observatory and stared up at the faint Milky Way stretching above. A shooting star arced overhead, with a trail that lingered for a few seconds, as if to convince me it was real, and not a spark of my imagination. It was easy, in those late nights, when I was wrapped up in the glittering sky with bugs chirping in my ear, to imagine that New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment, was really magical.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eagle-1-800x534.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eagle-2-800x505.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eagle-3-1-800x600.jpg]!#@To a 16-year-old me, the kind of STEM-based community that SSP gave me was impossible to even conceive of. Even now, it astounds me. At SSP, I learned over and over that somehow, every single person there was singularly incredible. Everyone had lived such different experiences, and they all had hobbies and skills and passions in so many different areas that conversations could go on for hours without ever getting old.!#@p!#@It’s now been nearly 3 years since I last saw most of my SSPeople in person, but that’s not to say they’re gone. We helped and supported and celebrated each other through college applications, and now we keep up through dms and group chats. I’ve stayed with one SSPer in her room at Yale, and visited two more at Columbia when I took a day trip to New York. Some of my SSP friends now attend MIT with me, and when anyone visits Boston, we reminisce and catch up over lunch. It’s no surprise, of course, when I learn that my SSPers, some of the most amazing people I’ve ever met, have continued to be amazing over the past few years.!#@p!#@If I had to point to a single thing that has led me to where I am now, it would be SSP. Even apart from the community I’ve been gushing about, it introduced me to astrophysics, a field I adore and that I’ve been studying and researching in ever since. Through SSP, I accessed resources and technologies that were simply impossible to obtain by myself. From my SSPers, I’ve gotten invaluable advice about high school, college applications, and MIT life. More intangibly, I gained the confidence that I had the independence, responsibility, and skill needed to thrive in a place as fast-paced and intense as SSP.!#@p!#@SSP brands itself as the “educational experience of a lifetime,” but to only focus on education is selling it short. In almost every possible area, SSP has changed my life.!#@p!#@P.S. I wrote my first-ever blog at SSP, while I was quarantined from Covid.

clay crash course by Gloria Z. '26,one month of wheelthrowing later…,by Gloria Z. '26,"February 10, 2025","This IAP, I took pottery classes! Between class time, open studio, and one-time workshops, I threw on the wheel for an average of eight hours a week. Every weekend, I would walk 35 minutes or so past Fenway, a scarf wrapped tightly around my ears, listening to an audiobook or music or the whistling of the city. My destination, Brookline Arts Center, sat right next to St. Mary’s stop on the green line, across the street from Japonaise Bakery; it was a squat, proud building with a large yard and wrought-iron gates, with a high square window on the facade. Then it was hours of pushing wet mud forward; scraping redness off the wheel; and pulling, with trembling fingers, timid, slippery walls up to the sky. Too thin or too splayed and they crumpled, and I started all over again, spinning.!#@p!#@After class, I’d change out of my clay-crusted clothes, crack flakes of earth off the hems, and take the green line then the 1 bus back to campus. I loved these weekly jaunts into Boston–the walk brought me right down Commonwealth, past Kenmore, through Fenway, and into Brookline. (One of the many luxuries of IAP is to be able to spend hours just walking around, with no psets or deadlines in mind.) In the summer after freshman year, I had actually lived right next to Kenmore, so it was nice seeing the familiar sights and realizing, after a few times, that I no longer needed to consult Google Maps at every turn.!#@p!#@After each session, as I sat on the T, I would note down everything I had worked on that day, what had succeeded and what had failed. This blog is an abridged collection of those notes, logging one month of ceramics progress.!#@p!#@(Disclaimer: I didn’t go in completely new–I’d attended a wheelthrowing workshop last year, and the year before, I had taken half of a four-session wheelthrowing class with MIT Arts Studios. So I knew enough to know that throwing is way harder than it looks, but I hadn’t retained much of the actual muscle memory.)!#@p!#@To start, the instructor tasked us with throwing the most fundamental shape: a straight, even cylinder. They broke it down in steps:!#@p!#@1) Pat the clay into a ball and lob it onto the wheel, aiming for the center.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step1-400x400.png]!#@2) Center the clay. From this step onwards, the wheel is kept spinning and the clay is kept wet. In the centering process, you push in firmly to force the clay up and down until it reaches a radially symmetric conelike shape. It’s important that the clay is properly centered, as otherwise the resulting pot will be asymmetric and it’ll be a lot harder to control.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step2-400x400.png]!#@3) Drill a hole. Using your thumbs (or pointer fingers, or something else), “dive” into the middle of the centered clay to start creating the inner cavity. Stop when you reach your desired floor thickness–this can either be gauged visually or with a needle tool.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step3-400x400.png]!#@4) Widen the cavity. Pulling outwards with fingers inside of the drilled hole, slowly widen it until you reach your desired floor width. You’ll end up with something that looks like a donut with flat inner walls.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step4-400x400.png]!#@5) Pull the walls upwards. Gathering the excess clay from the outside of the lump, slowly pull upwards to elongate and thin out the walls. You’re looking for a slightly tapered triangle, thickest at the base. Make sure you pull evenly, as fluctuations in wall thickness can make your pot unstable. Repeat until satisfied! This is the exciting part, where you can define the shape and character of your vessel.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step5-400x400.png]!#@6) Make finishing touches. Scrape off excess clay at the foot of your pot; use a needle or wire tool to even out the rim; round the lip over with a soft sponge; and glide your kidney tools over the inside and outside walls to scrape off excess slip.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step6-400x400.png]!#@7) Slice your piece off the wheel with your wire tool, and set it somewhere safe to dry!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/step7-400x400.png]!#@We started with lumps of clay that were about one pound each. It’s easier to center smaller amounts of clay, because they exert less force on your palms, but as a result, you’re limited in how big you can make your vessels. At the end of week 1, I ended up with the following bowl and two mugs:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/week1-800x600.png]!#@My takeaways from week 1:!#@p!#@In week two, I increased the amount of clay I was working with to 1.5-2 pounds and really focused on centering. It was definitely a struggle to wrangle the larger lumps, and I started using both hands to keep the clay in place, having previously just been using my right palm. Centering tends to take me a long time–lots of coning up and down, accidentally introducing irregularities, and then having to correct those issues–so one of my goals is to get faster, so I can get to the fun part of actually shaping the vessel. At the end of week 2, I had kept the following two bowls:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/week2.1-400x533.jpg]!#@And I had attached my first handle, to a lopsided cylinder I made back in the first class.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/week2.2-400x534.png]!#@I also trimmed my two small cups from the previous week, shown above between the two bowls! Trimming occurs when a piece has dried about halfway and reached a texture referred to as “leather hard”; in this process, the pot is affixed to the wheel either with water or pieces of soft clay, and slowly “pruned” (idk how else to describe it). Here, potters can add features like a foot ring, carved patterns and ridges, and holes, or just smooth out and refine the shape overall. However, edits made at this stage are permanent, and although you can make a lot of edits still, the overarching shape of the vessel can’t really be changed anymore.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trimmingexplain-400x400.png]!#@Takeaway from week 2:!#@p!#@I came into week 3 with two goals: improve my centering technique and make some bowls! Because of the way I center, I often end up with a wide, low skirt of clay at the bottom of my piece. This isn’t an issue for the final pot because I can scrape off the excess with a wooden rib tool and recycle it, but it does lead to a lot of clay that doesn’t make it in. So if I started with 2 pounds, I might end up only using 1.7 or 1.5 effectively. I wanted to improve the way I cone and manage the clay during centering in order to end up with more of a gumdrop rather than bell curve shape:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/centeringexplain-400x400.png]!#@My second goal was to make some bowls! The steps for a bowl versus a straight cylinder are slightly different, but the principles are the same. The instructor advised me to set the wheel to a very low speed – lower than I would think – when pulling/expanding the bowl walls, and I found that this gave me a lot more control over the shape. I ended up keeping the following:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/week3-400x300.jpg]!#@Takeaways from week 3:!#@p!#@In the last couple sessions, we trimmed, underglazed, and glazed our pieces. They actually get fired twice: first, to go from greenware (basically just dried clay) to bisqueware (fired, very hard/durable, but not food-safe), and second, to vitrify the glassy glaze. Unfortunately, tragedy struck after the bisque firing–the matcha bowl developed a tiny hairline crack…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_8549-400x533.jpg]!#@This meant that the piece was no longer watertight, or functional as a matcha bowl. I did still glaze it, just to see how the color turned out, but I couldn’t use it as a gift anymore :(.!#@p!#@Fortunately, the other pieces I put into the bisque firing did survive. Some I ended up scrapping before the firing, for the sake of not cluttering my dorm room, but the ones I did underglaze/fire/glaze are below. I’m especially excited about the berry bowl/colander and the bowl with birds on the side!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_8550-400x300.jpg]!#@Don’t be fooled by the matte, muted colors of the glazes in the picture – after the firing, they’ll solidify into beautiful glossy colors through some chemical witchcraft. I won’t actually get to pick up my pieces for another month or so, depending on the studio’s kiln schedule, so I don’t have pictures of them for this blog (sorry to end on a cliffhanger). But I’ll definitely be posting a pottery update later this semester, and they’ll be in there. Speaking of which…!#@p!#@I’m super excited to be taking an intermediate wheelthrowing class this semester in the student center pottery space! It comes with studio access outside of class times, meaning I can practice whenever I want. I’d like to get better at throwing large vessels so that I can illustrate them, combining my drawing/painting experience with pottery. Also, at the end of the semester, if my friends and I have produced enough functional pots, we want to try to hold a little ceramics pop-up fundraiser.!#@p!#@I really love how process-focused pottery is: my instructor emphasized the idea that if you make something once, you should be able to make it again, and I think this helps me detach from the final product and really just invest in the process. It’s also so gratifying to be able to make functional objects that people can use in their daily lives–that aspect of utility is so special.

anatomy of a freshman year 🦴🧠🩸🖐️🫀 by Fiona L. '27,"my first year at mit, told through the body",by Fiona L. '27,"February 9, 2025","there would be no body without the bones. just how there would be no “college” without the hallmarks typically associated with the classic american college experience: classes, clubs, a diverse group of students smiling and laughing while sitting on a perfectly sunlit lawn under a tree.!#@p!#@in my freshman year, i aimed to get my girs ⁠01 done following the advice of my amazing first year advisor, adam albright. i was disappointed about my advisor placement at first, since i had only applied for advising seminars (includes both advising and a weekly exploratory seminar) and had been placed with a traditional advisor (only advising) instead. but mit’s beloved linguistics professor “prof. albright”, or “adam”, as i knew him, easily found a way into my heart. in our meetings throughout my first semester, we chatted about major plans, extracurriculars, life at mit and how “there are so many ways to be a spider”. 02!#@p!#@my first semester, i took 3.091 03 and 8.022 04 : the former was a pretty standard gir class experience. i wasn’t as interested compared to the classes in my major that i would take later on. but i saw a lot of familiar faces⁠05 and some new information about chemistry. 8.022 was more memorable. i had opted to take 8.022 instead of the “standard” version of physics because i was still stuck in the mindset of always defaulting to the “hardest things available”. looking for challenge, i definitely got what i asked for. i talked to the professor about whether or not i should drop to 8.02 after a particularly disastrous midterm. stubbornly, and a bit riskily, i decided not to. through a combination of psetting with friends, attending office hours, and getting outside help, i somehow managed to scrape through in that class. i think 8.022 for me was what a lot of new students need coming into mit. being thrown into the deep end of mit’s potential for academic rigor, all with the safety net of pnr⁠06 beneath us. i could no longer get away with viewing my academics as something “trivial”. instead, i had to develop the study habits i’d been neglecting for the first 18 years of my life.!#@p!#@in my freshman spring, i took 21m.701, drawing for designers. the class gave me a brief window of time every week where i was “forced” to dedicate the time to drawing, a hobby that i wanted to get into but never really put a lot of time into. here are some of the pieces i made during that class:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zV121ZH7RTKxV_I9HBpLTw-e1738943168410-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/oFLtGlpjRo6HpxcNXAO92Q-e1738943086734-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lKHH4RQTQt6On7iaflcfiA-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CJKzS0V-Q6-dCKoim2i9Iw-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0MZAnI_BRHeHC0caZy5vyA-800x600.jpg]!#@i also took 12.409, hands-on astronomy, where i learned how to use a telescope to observe stars from atop the roof of building 37⁠07 , as well as the locations of major stars and constellations and some terminology covering the coordinates of stars. other perks include being able to go to Wallace observatory, about an hour drive from mit, and get your own photo of an astronomical object. it’s a decent class (maybe slightly overhyped unless you’re really into astronomy), but i feel like i didn’t get as much out of it as i should’ve. my photo of an astronomical object ended up just being a picture of space—apparently, i had entered the coordinates wrong.!#@p!#@on the extracurricular side of things, i feel like i “tried” a whole host of different activities:  Lecture Series Committee (LSC)⁠08 , Digital Art & Animation @ MIT (DAAMIT), The Tech, Asian Dance Team (ADT), Next Sing, to name a few. 09 but the student org i gravitated towards the most, ESP⁠10 , gave me two things, things i now look for in every student org i consider joining: things that i genuinely wanted to do, and a tight knit community i feel that i belong in. when i felt that a group lacked one or both of these things, i didn’t feel as much as a desire to get highly involved.!#@p!#@ESP ran programs for high schoolers and middle schoolers in the area 11 , including Splash, Spark, Spring HSSP, and Cascade. it was also an amazing community, with a large messenger chat that was always active, and a room in the fourth floor of the stud that i could go to at any time, even odd hours of the night, and find somebody to chat or co-work with. they were incredibly supportive as mentors to my naive frosh self, and constantly looking for ways to improve as a club and restructure old systems in a better way. their documentation was impressive, and alumni seemed to want to come back and visit as well. another amazing thing about the club was their approach to failure. i did so many things wrong / non-ideally while learning how to run programs, but i was never ever made to feel like i messed up or that anything was my fault.!#@p!#@i still think fondly of all my time spent with ESP both inside and outside the club, including when i went to new hampshire for a club retreat with them. we had an event called juice bar, where the freshmen concocted “juices” out of various substances for the upperclassmen to enjoy. i’ll never forget the reaction when i brought out “The Kid Who Flew All The Way from California to Attend MIT Splash”, a juice featuring avocado, soy sauce, and a few other ingredients that i can no longer remember. 12!#@p!#@i also did a urop⁠13 during iap⁠14 and spring semester, which focused on designing an ai tool meant to help comic artists storyboard.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-11.41.44-AM-800x679.png]!#@during my fpop⁠15 , i got the advice of not getting a urop my freshman fall, which i disagree with. 16 i felt that i personally could’ve definitely benefited from experiencing more of mit while i was on pnr, and the advice wasn’t one-size-fits-all for all freshmen. i really liked getting a peek into what life as a grad student was like, as well as how research projects operated. i even got to contribute to some of the paper that my team was writing through a literature review! despite this, i felt that a lot of my work ended up being rote, and i could have advocated for myself more during the urop.!#@p!#@i think something that i took away from all of my freshman year was to do a good job to whatever i commit to. through my own experiences⁠17 i saw the human cost of what happened when somebody half-assed the commitments. freshmen are told that “upperclassmen will understand”, although from my point of view, dropping a club too late or without communication, or “silently dropping” a club by simply disappearing or half-assing things, can make things a lot harder for others, who then have to pick up the slack. plus, i think having a positive reputation as somebody who works hard and can generally be relied on to do certain things is quite valuable as well.!#@p!#@skin is the barrier between the self and the outside world. in terms of mit, it’s the harvard bridge connecting mit and boston. i crossed this bridge many times, whether i was visiting a museum, going to a comic expo, or attending freshman formal at the top of the prudential. along the way, i went to plymouth over thanksgiving weekend and visited cape cod.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wvPrP9mXQYqrUQ461V1_2g-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rpDL9OrBRLamqkcOw8PbRg-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/m1WsB1AMS5ynYPsiyxZ1lA-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/82md_AzWT0umgOXPOPeKnw.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3LG9kyKaRrCIaAFjpyylLw.jpg]!#@but the idea of “skin” appears again in social context. to “have a thick skin” means to listen to criticism from others without letting it affect how you feel. it presents the skin as the barrier separating your feelings from others.!#@p!#@in my first semester, confined to one of the smallest triples in simmons⁠18 , i struggled a lot with the inconveniences of living in a college dorm. that was when i realized how much my emotions could run out of control day after day without a consistent routine and the coziness of my old life. i hated being woken up because a roommate had early morning classes, i hated having to do laundry every week, i hated being late to school because i had left 12 minutes early because of 15.!#@p!#@during my freshman fall, i sometimes felt it when i was at my most frustrated. in my stomach, and in all the air i breathed, a wizened loneliness took root. i wanted so badly for somebody to help me, to tell me they had felt every frustration i’ve felt before and that they would help me through everything that came ahead. i felt that 19 there was nobody in the world who could understand my loneliness, this awful feeling that turned my previously planar life into jagged geometries. everybody who truly cared about me was over a thousand miles away, and i was left to fend for myself in this world where everybody seemed to know each other and was doing better than me.!#@p!#@it took a long longer for me to finally find “my people,” but in the end, without even noticing the exact moment, it happened. i didn’t have to look too far. these people were “hiding” in my living group, in my classes, and in the clubs i was in. all i had to do was be patient, to wait for the right string of conversations to pull us together, before one day i would find them sitting comfortably in my heart.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.57.58-AM-800x432.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.58.08-AM-800x434.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.58.17-AM-800x436.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.58.39-AM-800x433.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.58.48-AM-800x434.png]!#@i think the number of people i grew to trust increased exponentially for me. friends introduced me to friends, and i bonded and got to know more new people. i am reminded of something that would happen whenever i tried to paint in watercolor. i’d use too much water here or too much paint there, and suddenly, a tiny window of color would bleed into its neighbors, consuming everything in its wake. i feel like that pocket of color, bleeding into my neighbors, except, inadvertently, i’d absorb a little fraction of their colors, a little fraction of what made that group of friends grow closer together.!#@p!#@in chinese culture, healthy hair is considered a sign of prosperity and vitality. to be honest, i never knew about that aspect of “my own” culture. my parents were pretty practical about hair 20 , down to the point where my mom had me wash my hair in vinegar to get rid of lice. to me, hair is more like a record of time. i dyed my hair dark brown after graduating from high school. it’s not a color that’s really unnatural or stands out, but it’s obvious to see the boundary straddling my skull, a delicate shoreline separating the natural and unnatural, reminding myself that i can never really change the color underneath. as i’ve stumbled through my post-high-school life, that thin line started to fall, as if it represented that very date—may 25, 2023, my high school graduation—being pushed further in the past. yet it still stayed, as well as the brown section of my hair beneath it, just like my high school self, who found an alcove in my consciousness and hid there, refusing to fade into irrelevancy as i started a new chapter of my life.!#@p!#@i could feel its presence, a little bit. in what my favorite teachers had taught me coming back in my girs, in my unquenchable need for academic validation that now went unfilled, in my inability to manage my life without a parent in it. but there were parts of my old self that i really wanted to stick to.!#@p!#@in high school, i built my extracurricular identity almost entirely around being a “teen writer.” i dove head-first into one of the most fascinating microcosms of overachieving high schoolers, one where you’d regularly encounter teens with the publication history of an accomplished 40-year-old writer, where an acceptance to a top summer camp is your ticket to meet the fellow high schoolers whose words you’ve obsessed over and analyzed and tried to emulate in a thousand different unconscious ways. i joined discord servers of other high schoolers who identified as “teen writers,” and together we sent our writing to literary magazines, crumbled over the biggest names in high school writing competitions—Scholastic, Foyle, YoungArts—and, ultimately, shared our admissions to top colleges.!#@p!#@in my freshman fall, i tried to force myself to write every week. consistency was something i struggled with, as i preferred to either procrastinate something eternally or go all into it for one or two days. it took a lot of mental energy to write something every week, but it helped a lot to force myself to write at regular intervals, and be pleasantly content with the results, rather than wait for “inspiration” to strike. 21 i am a firm disbeliever in writers block, since i think it’s possible to put yourself in a state to generate ideas by forcing yourself to work at certain times, until it becomes routine.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-07-at-10.49.45-AM-9.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-07-at-10.35.14-AM-5-800x1204.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-07-at-10.33.50-AM-4-800x367.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-07-at-10.32.51-AM-800x425.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-07-at-10.32.20-AM-1.png]!#@but for these pieces, i didn’t send them in to any magazines. i wanted to write without the promise of publication or recognition anywhere down the line. because even when i was young, i loved writing. when i was five, i made little booklets of stories: trashy, terrible stories with nonsensical endings, typos, and an obvious self-insert named “Fiona”. each page would have a tacky, crayon pictures of whatever scene i was imagining in my mind. i would “sell” these stories to my dad, and he would pay me in spare change. as i grew older, i stuck with writing even when i didn’t *like* it, when it got hard or i ran out of ideas or i hated my own work, which is how i knew i *loved* it.!#@p!#@the heart always acts as a symbol of love and emotion, the eternal arch-nemesis and reluctant collaborator to the brain. but from a scientific standpoint, i never understood that. perhaps, the heart is even one of the most methodical, unemotional parts of the body. if it even dared to sleep or take a rest, the body would collapse into a corpse, like an entire city robbed of light. and so it continues to beat, over and over, the most diligent worker in my library of organs.!#@p!#@during freshman year, i learned a lot about routines and consistency. as i stayed up late engaged in deep conversation, or skipped studying to hang out with friends, i saw how my work suffered because of these choices. yet those interactions with others were the best i’ve ever had, and i felt that i’d always look back on my present with unblemished nostalgia. i felt like i was responsible for creating the memories that my future self could cling onto in the dregs of adulthood.!#@p!#@responsibility, and the development of it, as well as self improvement as a whole, has always been an incredibly important subject to me. as a kid, i used to be incredibly irresponsible, always forgetting about homework deadlines and pushing work to the last minute. it took a lot of practice to become a more responsible person throughout high school. i thought that would be enough, but mit presented itself as a tougher challenge to me: there was a constant stream of interesting events, and schoolwork that was more rigorous and more abundant.!#@p!#@expected value calculations, in theory, seem to be a good way to live life. i’d just constantly choose to do what brought the greatest value to my life. but in 24.00 22 , i learned about “diversity of value.” how two things are so different they can never be compared, how one can never be more valuable than the other. whether i chose sleep, or work, or my friends, i’d always be “missing out” on a near infinite number of other things i could be doing.!#@p!#@this is something i’m still working on, as i try to balance friends, school, sleep, applications, shifting my finger around until i find the center of gravity of my life.!#@p!#@my brain thought a lot about itself during my freshman year. i came to mit after being hailed as a “math genius” at my high school, who leaned a little bit too much into the identity of loving math and programming, who came to not just crave academic validation, but expect it. at mit, i learned that in terms of ego, a common saying applies. “the higher you go, the harder you fall.”!#@p!#@i remember, freshman fall, checking canvas to see that i had gotten a 59 on my first midterm in 8.022. this was indicative of many things: i was still very much adjusting to the college experience, i had no good support systems at the time, i had incredibly poor study habits, and scores that were considered “bad” in high school can actually be quite “good” in college. but my brain only thought one thing: i am stupid. there were people around me who had founded entire companies, published award winning research, and had gone to international olympiads. i had no research experience, had never created anything “really cool” in high school 23 , and my scores on academic competitions paled against my peers’.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3FF34B0AADB1-1-800x486.jpeg]!#@freshman spring was no better. 24 i learned that, at mit, there are a lot of common ways to think about grades and self worth, and most of them aren’t very good for you. i think i fell into that trap after the “grace period” of pnr was lifted.!#@p!#@because of the attitude i had in freshman year, as well as some very flawed things that others had said to me, i came to believe that intelligence was something that could be inferred from grades, and that i had to define myself and my own performance based on somebody else’s standards. it was hell, for both my self-esteem and how i viewed my classes, and my excessive doomerism about what grade i was going to get in a class sometimes got in the way of me focusing on the material.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ce8603d2e54bd7c2f3ac5a4fc6a0ca19-1755060433-16-800x450.jpg]!#@but looking back on it, i think that putting people on a pedestal for their intelligence or their gpa is something adjacent to objectification. 25 you’re essentially defining somebody in a very one-sided way based solely on one, superficial aspect of themselves. it’s one thing to admire somebody’s work ethic, study habits, or focus, but a whole other thing to idolize people. when it happened to me back in high school, it make me dependent on validation and gave me a false sense of self that only served to hurt me in my college years.!#@p!#@i was lucky to be surrounded by many people who didn’t have toxic ideas about grades. around these people, i knew i would never be judged for how i did in a class, and that i would never be forced to share a grade if i didn’t want to. they let me know something that everybody should keep in mind when going through college—grades don’t matter. *⁠26 **⁠27 ***⁠28!#@p!#@at mit, my entire identity isn’t dependent on being smart. i quickly stopped trying to over-present as “the math kid 📚✖️➕➗🔢” after coming to mit. i also found the freedom to fail or do average or say “not very smart things”⁠29 here without worrying too much about “oh no what if random strangers dont think im super duper smart anymore”. in addition, it’s nice to not have everything come incredibly easily. being average in any environment means that you have to work for basically everything, but that you can do almost anything by working extremely hard. 30!#@p!#@for the time being, i’ve decided to try not sharing my final grades with anybody in my technical subjects. this includes if i get an a in a class. it’s not because i don’t trust people, or because i want to be secretive, it’s more of a deal i have with myself. 31 i know i tend to get worried about other people’s perceptions sometimes. i want to make myself get used to operating outside of that, to know for certain that i am not studying for the sake of my friends/classmates and that i can evaluate my performance in a subject by my own standards, and with full knowledge (aka not just a letter grade) of how that semester went for me.!#@p!#@as an mit student, i cannot talk about the brain without following up with the hands. (as per mit’s motto, menus et manus, meaning “mind and hand,” which i think matches mit’s commitment to intellectual pursuits as well as creation of all kinds)!#@p!#@with my hands, i made things ranging from a metal casted pear⁠32 to a glass pumpkin⁠33 to a rug of kirby. i took classes and workshops that held even the slightest to me, and ended up with a bunch of knowledge about devices i’d never even seen before coming to mit. i also signed up for a bunch of makerspace trainings, which are free and available here! my favorite was the sewing training, where i followed along in making a pencil case that i still use now!!#@p!#@freshman fall was when i started to get into crochet, because one of my roommates at the time, sharon z ’27, had a cute penguin on her bedframe that she made from a crochet kit. i then impulsively ordered some crochet kits off of amazon, and got to work.!#@p!#@at the same time, in 6.101 34 i learned to make programs ranging from an SAT Solver⁠35 to a game of snake.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fT2sA3k6ROe4ePGMLnkqIQ-3-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/7VesVWCuQBi-LvbJ30hhnA-3-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Y_brmcrjQ0iuAQDujEE7Gg-3-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CRuUm7QkQ4uggIaBRRfzIg-2.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ean7bFCTSZC-SqIdRFLMTg-1.jpg]!#@i realized a love of making cool things, both in and outside of my classes. i loved the feeling that i, a person with little experience in making digital and physical things, could still create projects from raw materials that were coherent, functional, and sometimes even pretty.!#@p!#@but it wasn’t just making ~things~ that excited me. i found that my hands 36 . could also make interesting events happen. i organized the first [redacted] family dinner, bringing a bunch of mit affiliates with my surname together, sold clothing on dormspam, and walked through the halls of mit dressed in a pear costume. i realized that here in college, i had a lot more freedom to simply make cool things happen. and with this freedom, i stretch the bounds of my imagination on what can be done in pursuit of entertainment 37 . after all, i had more than enough passionate, creative people around me, some of whom were happy to help or co-collaborate.!#@p!#@writing the rest of this post was not completely easy. i think of writing about my self like trying to domesticate an ecosystem of wild memories. there are some memories that come easily after being prodded, hundreds of words flowing easily onto the page. there are some memories that feed off of each other, that prey on one another, that cannot stand even being in the same room together. there are memories which are nicked and scarred, which hide in the dark recesses of the mind, often referenced but not often remembered. they come out as a few words at a time, then a deep pause, then deletion, then a few more words. it’s never easy to write about these memories, especially when i know there’s an audience. but there’s something cathartic about writing about them, a way of reorganizing and recategorizing my struggles, in the hopes of viewing things objectively enough to learn lessons from the past.!#@p!#@after both my freshman semesters, i remember turning to instagram and seeing people’s “semester recaps”. i saw pictures of every living group and student org under the sun, and rows upon rows of smiling friends. i guess i had those too, but i had a lot of being confused and doing stuff incredibly badly and feeling incredibly, incredibly lonely along the way. i know, i know, i know the obvious sentiment that instagram does *not* reflect reality, but surrounded by so many pictures of so many “successful” first years, i couldn’t help but feel if i was the odd one out, or if everybody else “knew something” that i didn’t.!#@p!#@sometimes, including now, i think about whether or not i am/was happy. my own mental state was (and still is) the reserve of energy on which everything else depended—the routines in my life, my academic performance, my social interactions, and so much more. if i was motivated, if i was optimistic, if i was dedicated to doing a good job, if i put intrinsic over extrinsic motivation. in every action i took, a little bit of what was going in my mind was left behind as residue, like the faint memory of a fingerprint on everything i touched. it was like blood, the reserve of energy flowing through my body.!#@p!#@“i’d rather be unhappy here than happy anywhere else,” i remember saying to a friend. i don’t think this was the best way to express my sentiment, since i think there are definitely problems with overwork at this school that i don’t want to play into and let ruin me. but what i meant was that all the challenges i experienced here, whether i took them on (difficult classes, a packed schedule) or not (issues with loneliness, homesickness, not knowing how to live day-to-day independently), have pushed me into a period of unprecedented growth.!#@p!#@there are different types of happiness. the happiness you get at completing a bunch of easy challenges is very different than the happiness you get at completing something very difficult. one is feeling dopamine in the moment, yet mentally knowing that you have not used your time in the best way possible. the other is a lot of struggling and gathering the courage to ask questions, and maybe having your self image be called into question, but knowing that you are growing so, so much.!#@p!#@last year, there

trying to describe it with the binary label of “happy” or “sad”, or even to rate it on a one dimensional scale. so i’ll think about it in terms of growth. a year does not make a perfect body, or a

It’s Not Bra-Ket Science by Andi Q. '25,Building quantum computers to convince myself that they exist,by Andi Q. '25,"February 7, 2025","I don’t believe in quantum physics.!#@p!#@Yes, I know that all the math works out beautifully. And that no experimental evidence has ever disproven it. And that my smartphone – its tens of billions of transistors, LEDs, and other semiconductor devices – would not exist without our modern understanding of quantum mechanics. It’s just… none of it… feels real. I simply refuse to believe in such strange, unintuitive physics that I’ve never physically experienced.!#@p!#@Well, I’ve never directly experienced it, anyway. Sure, I’ve seen demonstrations of the photoelectric effect and the double-slit experiment (which prove that light is fundamentally quantum mechanical). And I suppose every chemical reaction in my body keeping me alive is technically a quantum process. But those don’t count! What I really want to see is something like a person falling through the floor (via quantum tunneling) or just straight-up teleportation. You know, the cool stuff you see in sci-fi movies and expect to learn at MIT (but never do because it’s not real).!#@p!#@At this point, I’m somewhat convinced that quantum mechanics is just a very elaborate inside joke that physicists made up a century ago to confuse everyone else. What do you mean an electron is “like a ball that’s spinning, but it’s not actually a ball, and it’s not actually spinning”? How could it possibly be true that electrons “don’t actually move from point A to point B but instead just spontaneously appear at point B sometimes”? Truly statements dreamed up by the utterly deranged.!#@p!#@And don’t even get me started on quantum “computers”. I bet you’ve never seen one in real life. But I have, and it was basically just a big metal cylinder with a cluster of tubes running out of it. Nothing like the sleek and elegant computer you’re probably reading this on right now.!#@p!#@“Haha, that’s a real scary-looking trash can you guys have there.”!#@p!#@“Actually, Andi, that’s MIT Lincoln Lab’s quantum computer.”!#@p!#@“Yeah, sure it is. What’s next, that shoebox on the table is also a quantum computer?”!#@p!#@“…”!#@p!#@However, all this skepticism ends this semester. It is now 2025 – the 100th anniversary of modern quantum mechanics – and the stars have aligned in every way possible for me to take a quantum engineering class and get over my non-belief.!#@p!#@Quantum engineering classes didn’t even exist at MIT when I was a freshman, but these days, we have 6.2410 (Quantum Systems Engineering Laboratory). 6.2410 is a lab-based class where we build physical quantum sensors out of lasers and stuff, and it is exactly what I need to convince myself that quantum physics is real.!#@p!#@I found out about 6.2410 a year ago because one of the professors saw me working on a project for a completely unrelated class and decided (very serendipitously) to invite me on a tour of the lab with all the equipment. (I must add that I did not know this professor, and this interaction happened at ~7 AM, so it was very much like being visited by a fae.) It was too late to add the class at that point in the semester, but that lab tour was what first got me curious about quantum engineering.!#@p!#@After that, I didn’t think much more about quantum engineering until about two months ago. But that’s when the stars really started to align.!#@p!#@First, Google announced its Willow quantum chip in December, demonstrating useful error correction for the first time ever in a quantum system. It just so happened that Professor Will Oliver – one of the researchers who worked on Willow – teaches a different quantum engineering class in the spring.!#@p!#@Next, when planning my classes for this semester, both quantum engineering classes conveniently fit right in between the few classes I needed to take. And – surprise, surprise – the non-quantum alternatives did not fit at all.!#@p!#@Finally, at the end of IAP (a week ago), I participated in iQuHack (MIT’s quantum computing hackathon) out of boredom and curiosity. Despite only having taken Course 3’s⁠01 introductory quantum mechanics class, I somehow still ended up winning one of the categories.!#@p!#@At this point, I knew what I had to do. Heck, my last name is literally “Qu”! The universe was almost begging me to take those quantum engineering classes.!#@p!#@Anyway, all this is to say that I’m taking those classes now, and it’ll be an awesome time. I probably won’t be able to build a fully functional quantum chip like Willow by the end of the semester, but I’ll definitely try to get close.!#@p!#@(Also, if you were wondering what the title means, see here.)!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its-not-bra-ket-science/

GELcamp by Emiko P. '25,project management… in the woods?,by Emiko P. '25,"February 6, 2025","A few days ago I got back from what I can only describe as a four-day fever dream. Here’s a diary of everything that went down during GELcamp…!#@p!#@Hello! I am currently typing this in 14 degree weather, snuggled up in a remote New Hampshire cabin with 40-ish people from MIT and Wellesley. Today was our first day of GELcamp (more formally known as Camp Cody, and even more formally known as 6.9140: Project Engineering Management), an intense four-day course for students in the Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership (GEL) program.!#@p!#@For those of you that don’t know, GEL is a program that teaches MIT and Wellesley engineering students a leadership curriculum through weekly lectures and weekly hands-on labs over the course of an entire year. I was a GEL1 my junior year, and I am now continuing the program as a GEL2 during my senior year, where I help mentor and coordinate the GEL1s. Check out their website to learn more!!#@p!#@Our journey to GELcamp started with a two-hour bus-ride from campus to New Hampshire, where we arrived at the snowy front gate of Camp Cody. I wasn’t expecting much, so I was surprised to be greeted by a cozy summer camp with dozens of little green cabins and a ginormous iced-over lake.!#@p!#@After tossing our bags in the cabin and claiming our bunks, we headed straight to our first class. There are a total of eight lectures taught in this project management course (each being 1.5 hours long), and the first two were called: 1) Strategy, Charters, & Targets and 2) History of Project Management, Intro to Scheduling, Critical Path Method. I’ve been more and more interested in leadership and maybe even running my own company one day, so the main thing I want to get out of this course is concrete project management tools and strategies that I can implement in the future. Only two lectures in, and I was already given a few tangible ideas.!#@p!#@Dinner was held in the main cabin with a roaring fire, and I felt like I had been transported back to summer camp at Camp Lakewood in 5th grade. But instead of being like 10 years old, I was a 21-year-old supposedly full-fledged adult, and instead of being forced to eat spaghetti with no utensils, there was a taco and churros buffet that surprisingly hit the spot.!#@p!#@We then transitioned to our group project that we will be working on these next four days. I was assigned to the Blue Team, and our project was to design and build a solar farm to help offset MIT’s carbon emissions! Half the time we worked on the project charter, and the other half we were watching various Blue Man group videos.⁠01!#@p!#@And that was the first day!! It’s lights out in two minutes, so I’ll see you tomorrow :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.11.55_f3e983c2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.24.05_7204ee88-800x622.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0016-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0002-3-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0026-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@Hi, there! It’s Day Two of GELcamp and I feel like I’ve lived two whole days today. We got up bright and early at 7 am for breakfast, and we had class from 8 am until noon. We covered three different lectures: 1) Project Elements: Scope, Activities, 2) Project Organizations, Teams, Allocations, and 3) Project Architecture: Dependence, Breakdown Structures. We learned a lot, but by the end of the fourth hour of lectures, we definitely needed a change of scenery – so that’s what happened!!#@p!#@After grabbing lunch, there was a four hour break, and about 20 of us headed off to the local ski resort to ski, snowboard, and snowshoe! I went skiing, and our little crew ranged from a legit professional speed-skier to legit first-timers. One of the first-timers was Joel S. ’25. Not only is Joel learning about 18 different project management tools over the course of four days, but he also went down a black diamond on his very first day of skiing! Talk about drinking from the firehouse. After one wipeout where he practically slid down the entire mountain face, skis and poles left behind in the dust, I asked him how he was feeling. I got the most enthusiastic “I am great!” I’ve ever heard. I think this ski trip will probably be one of my favorite moments of GELcamp.!#@p!#@I was pretty pooped from our ski day, but it was back to the grind. We had one more lecture called Design of Projects; Canonical Patterns, as well as a class-wide case study and discussion. We then did some more team work on our solar farm project, and then it was night night!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0023-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0025-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.16.48_f04434ad-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.13.06_263ca807-800x600.jpg]!#@Day three! Today was super busy so I’m writing this before bed! It is 1 in the morning! I am so sleep deprived! This is going to be a short rundown of the day. Two lectures⁠02 in the morning. Now 8/8 lectures finished. Then panel with industry mentors from Google, System Design and Management masters program, etc. Then went to the ski resort again but this time went snow tubing. Set a record for most people (20!!!!) going down the chute at once. Then dinner and build challenge with our small team. Tried to build a bridge. Stressful. Failed. Tragic. Then grinded on group project for final presentation tomorrow. Feeling good about our project but mostly just tired. It is now 1:05 am. Goodnight!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0017-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0015-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0014-800x1067.jpg]!#@Good afternoon! It’s the fourth and final day of GELcamp. I am writing this just after we gave our final presentation in front of the cohort. I thought it went pretty well, but we sadly didn’t receive all the funding we requested for our solar farm. #L. We did, however, receive feedback on how to revise our proposal for the future (basically our timeline for project completion was a bit too ambitious and we needed to add some slack). Also, side note, it was -2 degrees this morning and my nostrils literally froze on the walk to class, so that was a new sensation. At least I was entertained on that walk by Remi, Eva, and Steph (see pics below)!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0010-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0009-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG-20250202-WA0006-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@We packed up our cabin right after lunch, then hopped on the two-hour bus back to MIT. And with that, GELcamp aka Camp Cody aka 6.9140: Project Engineering Management was complete!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-06-at-15.12.36_28a6ea1a-400x251.jpg]!#@I think the two most important things I gained from this experience were:!#@p!#@1) Fun memories with my GEL cohort. I have to admit – GELcamp has definitely made me closer with my cohort, and I’m honestly glad I went on this trip (even though I cannot say with 100% honesty that it wasn’t hard and at times pretty exhausting). When I first started GEL, I only knew maybe 10% of my classmates, but now after going to this camp and spending the last two years within the learning community, I can now confidently say I have made core memories with at least 80% of the people in my cohort. Also, skiing and snow tubing were SO FUN!!#@p!#@2) Tangible project management tools that I will be comfortable using for my own projects. My personal favorites that I learned were: work breakdown structures, project network graphs, and risk matrices. Also, my favorite in-class exercise was when we had to optimize an example project’s cost and timeline by changing different resource parameters, like the number of people working on different parts of the project.!#@p!#@I swear this wasn’t on purpose, but the timing of this blog is pretty perfect because the 2025 GEL applications for both GEL1 and GEL2 have just opened up for MIT sophomores and juniors. Check that out here!

'24, MEng '25","February 5, 2025","i’ve started collecting cds. i think part of this has come from wanting to return to physical media, things i can hold in my hand and feel the weight of. there’s a distinct lack of permanence when it comes to accessing my favorite pieces of art in digital space.!#@p!#@i flirted with collecting vinyl for a while, but i’ve only ever bought one record. it was queen’s greatest hits and i think either the record was warped (15% likely) or the suitcase record player that daniel bought at a senior sale⁠01 was messed up (85% likely) because when we played it, freddie mercury warbled out a drunken rendition of bohemian rhapsody.!#@p!#@after that, i lost interest in vinyls. not because of freddie mercury — they’re just really expensive now. cheapo records in central square has a few cases of $1 records at the entrance, but it’s rare to find any real gems there.!#@p!#@when i was a kid, i had a binder full of cds and dvds and a player that would strap to the passenger seat in our car. i would sit in the backseat and obsessively watch the bee movie (which i got for my birthday in first grade). i liked flipping through things, choosing something, feeding it into the player and watching it boot up on the screen. i liked how tangible it felt.!#@p!#@over winter break, we took a day trip to seattle. it’s about a 2.5 hour drive and we went to pike place market to meet my friend alex, who was there for the holidays, as well as some of chris’s friends.!#@p!#@that was a blast — one of my favorite memories from visiting seattle in summer 2022 was going to pike place and eating a really delicious pastry with marzipan in it. this time, i kept asking alex if we could go to the marzipan place and they had no idea what i was talking about, and i kept saying, “you know, the marzipan place,” and finally we figured out that it was piroshky piroshky.!#@p!#@we ended up in a record store and i was looking at the cd section. we were going on so many long drives over break that i thought it’d be good to listen to some cds instead of spotify — our spotify playlists had lost some of their appeal.!#@p!#@i bought madonna’s 1998 album ray of light, we said goodbye to our friends, and started the drive back. it was cool feeding the cd into the player and hearing the sound filter through the speakers and listening to the album in the order that it was meant to be listened to.!#@p!#@an hour into our drive, we suddenly got a tire pressure warning on the interface. it was dark, around 9 pm. we were in a very rural place in northern washington. and the soundtrack accompanying all this was a series of psychedelic, haunting ambient tracks — a drastic departure from madonna’s usual style.!#@p!#@UMMM…..!#@p!#@not ideal!!!!!#@p!#@after some floundering, we pulled over to a gas station and inflated all the tires to the recommended pressure and were almost ready to get back on the highway before chris noticed a hissing sound coming from the rear left tire. the pressure had gone down 5 psi in two minutes and upon further inspection, we saw a giant nail firmly embedded in it.!#@p!#@so now we were trapped at the gas station. our phone batteries were both under 20%, but we still needed to look up a youtube tutorial on how to change a spare tire.!#@p!#@winter in the pacific northwest is cold and very misty and very foggy. as we stood there, surrounded by tall, looming pine trees, listening to the tinny sound of the mechanic blaring out from my phone, i suddenly understood why people there believe in cryptids.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/137F60F7-DC72-471A-B037-012FB1AD439B_1_105_c.jpeg]!#@we figured out how to access the spare tire and all the tools we would need, but neither of us had the strength to get the lugnuts off the tire.!#@p!#@at this point, a random man walked up to us with a donut and a coffee. he asked if we needed any help. we said, “yeah, can you get the lugnuts off this tire?”!#@p!#@so he set his coffee and donut down on the (wet) ground, took our wrench, and loosened the lugnuts for us.!#@p!#@“oh my god,” i said. “can we do anything for you? like buy you a coffee or something?”!#@p!#@he scratched his head. “ehhh, a few bucks would be nice.”!#@p!#@i pulled out my wallet and gave him the $10 i had in there. he accepted it, fetched his donut and coffee, took a bite, and wandered off into the mist.!#@p!#@this was not a very walkable area. it was close to the highway — just road and gas station, no sidewalks, and he just…ambled off. (an actual cryptid???)!#@p!#@after fumbling through the rest of the tutorial, we slowly pulled out of the gas station. madonna started playing again and i immediately hit pause. and because this was a spare tire, it couldn’t go above 50 miles an hour. which was a problem, because we still had about an hour on the highway to go, and we were crawling at a snail’s pace down the right lane as people beeped at us while they passed. we finally got to the border at 11:30 pm, right before it closed, and inched back home.!#@p!#@when we finally parked, i genuinely could not believe we had survived.!#@p!#@and then i went and bought more cds.!#@p!#@the first thing that krazy bob asked me when i walked into his music emporium: “what’s your elevation at sea level?”!#@p!#@bemused, i said, “0 feet?”!#@p!#@“CORRECT!” he gave me a playing card. “you’re the king of the day.”!#@p!#@the store was full of really crazy things, as the name might suggest. i found a lot of really great albums there: everybody else is doing it, so why can’t we? by the cranberries, pisces iscariot by the smashing pumpkins, blondie’s greatest hits, and when we answered a trivia question at the end after checking out, we were allowed to pick out a free gift from the front of the store. actually, we didn’t even answer the question correctly, but he asked a little girl if we should still get our gift and she decided to spare us. i picked out first band on the moon by the cardigans, which ended up being one of our favorite albums from our trip.!#@p!#@after getting back to boston, i started looking for more places to buy cds. in central square, boomerangs was a beloved thrift store that donated proceeds to hiv and aids resources. it shut down sometime last year and was reopened under a new parent company, more than words. i like their rotating selection of $1 cds to choose from, so i’ve been accumulating more, even though i don’t have a car here in boston or a cd player — though i hope to get the latter soon.!#@p!#@physicality has become a central value in my life. it’s part of why i love knitting and crocheting, because seeing what i make slowly come together with each stitch is immensely rewarding. i can stretch and manipulate the fabric i’ve created, and manifest almost anything i can imagine. it’s almost like 3D printing with yarn.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/C98F40F3-B7F2-454D-BF0F-17FDA71194CF_1_102_o.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/8FA93061-FF0F-49FF-B738-FE18A9D351BD_1_105_c.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/853354B8-915A-42CD-AF1D-EDE2E7B66273_1_105_c.jpeg]!#@that same sense of valuing the realness and weight of things is what draws me to labwork. in my urop, it felt like something had perfectly clicked together: i was in the lab learning how to use a platereader, run fluorescent assays, and program a pipetting robot. it all felt so real and i felt right at home.!#@p!#@maybe it’s the fact that when i’m handling physical things like cds or yarn or things in the lab, it’s easier to notice mistakes. maybe i stitched too much when i should have only done one stitch or there’s a giant nail in my tire that i have to fix or my cells aren’t growing. the process of tackling these problems and fixing them feels so natural to me and i learn better from making these sorts of mistakes. with every row of knitting, i’m better at maintaining the tension that i hold the yarn with, and i’m better at keeping track of how many stitches i need to make with a certain color. once, i accidentally left a box of antibiotics out to thaw overnight and i had to remake all of it. that’s something i learned from pretty quickly. i’m a better scientist for it.!#@p!#@when i make bigger mistakes that seem like there’s no coming back from, making smaller ones has given me the resilience i need to get past them.!#@p!#@i recently started attending a weekly fiber arts circle to meet more people in the boston area. this is part of a conscious effort to take a bigger role in the communities i’m part of. instead of isolating myself, i can open myself up to new experiences and learn from others. it’s been really refreshing going to these sessions and having no idea what these people do for work, only knowing the current project they’re working on, which range from mittens and scarves to intricate sweaters and shawls.!#@p!#@and when i have questions about knitting or grad school or the biotech industry, i know people who i can ask for help. i might feel like things are hopeless sometimes, but there are people who continue to take chances on me and believe in me. that has been a lifeline.!#@p!#@this past year has been such a weird transition phase. i tried some things that didn’t end up being good fits, but through all of that i learned more about myself and my working style. i’ve got some new exciting opportunities in front of me that i look forward to exploring — this semester already feels worlds better than the last.!#@p!#@i don’t feel like a fully fledged adult yet, but if i take it one step at a time, and hold onto the tangible things around me for support, i think i can make it.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/137F60F7-DC72-471A-B037-012FB1AD439B_1_105_c.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/C98F40F3-B7F2-454D-BF0F-17FDA71194CF_1_102_o.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/8FA93061-FF0F-49FF-B738-FE18A9D351BD_1_105_c.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/853354B8-915A-42CD-AF1D-EDE2E7B66273_1_105_c.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/real-things/
How to Make Money at MIT by Aiden H. '28,for all of us who don't know how to make a startup :(,by Aiden H. '28,"February 4, 2025","As someone who is notably not a millionaire, I started working in high school once I turned 16. And while a lot of students at other universities might continue to work off-campus jobs, this is very much not the culture at MIT. Considering that the workload here is commonly referred to with the strength of a firehose, hydrant, or any other painful form of water you can think of,⁠01 there wasn’t a realistic way for me to continue to serve 30 hrs/week like I used to. The good news is you don’t have to be an OnlyFans model entrepreneur to have some side hustles at MIT.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, the only blog posts about jobs I could find are both from 2008, and general inflation means that their $8.00/hr sounds borderline illegal.!#@p!#@Consider this a semi-comprehensive list of options at/around MIT to do passively throughout the school year, in the random and subjective order I thought of them/was told about them.!#@p!#@Note #1: I have of course not worked all of the following jobs in my ~6 months here and all benefits/cons are mostly from talking to others or found online. Consider this more a list of opportunities to look into than a review of what jobs are most worth it.!#@p!#@Note #2: As of AY2024-2025, MIT minimum wage for students is $15.00/hr. Unless otherwise specified, assume all directly MIT-associated jobs to be at this rate.!#@p!#@UROP⁠02 /ELO!#@p!#@The go-to MIT⁠03 work experience. There are a lot of blogs on UROPs already, so I won’t beat anyone over the head with it too hard, but their importance to the MIT experience can’t really be understated. It’s research at the top research university.!#@p!#@UROPs are technically a part of a larger ELO⁠04 program, but UROPS are the most common as they tend to be more accessible, known about, and specialized to major. Other ELO options include teaching/learning programs where students can teach students or gain internships that are not typically research-based (because then it would actually be UROP, but like same diff it doesn’t change what you would actually do per project).!#@p!#@UROPs are super common and have a lot of resources behind them (hence, the UROP office). This makes them an “easier” option to work during the semester, or at least more socially acceptable in a sense. Instead of having to work a random barista job that realistically will not contribute to your future career, UROPs are very educational for both research and industry experience (aka super resume-able).!#@p!#@However, everything depends on the project. Because these are more freelance-hiring style research jobs, trying to decide between multiple projects or knowing who you should work with is difficult, especially if you have a mid-semester major crisis and decide you want to completely switch everything you’re doing. Also, funding is not guaranteed. UROP students have to submit an online application at the start of each term appealing to the school for their project to be funded. Depending on the department the UROP is in, this can range from very possible to extremely unlikely (e.g. CSAIL⁠05 has a lot more research funding than, say, DMSE⁠06 ).!#@p!#@Base Pay: $16.00/hr for a max of $2400 a semester (Fall/Spring) or $7680 for summer!#@p!#@More info on UROPs here!#@p!#@Dorm Desk Worker!#@p!#@MIT has undergraduate students work the mail desk in the dorms. Students who work desk are allowed and encouraged to work on other things while at the desk, given that when someone needs their package you do your job. Depending on the dorm and term, schedules are either all pick-up (you sign up for as many shifts you want each week when the schedule is released) or a set schedule for all employees is agreed upon at the beginning of the term.!#@p!#@Unlike an intense UROP or off-campus job, no one’s working 10-20 hours a week at the desk. This is a great option for people looking for very passive income so that you have some extra fun-cash lying around. Also considering the workload here, it doesn’t hurt to have a noncommittal role that others are willing and eager to cover for. Also, the ability to do other work makes the commitment a lot less time-consuming. If you’re already sitting at your desk psetting, there’s no reason you shouldn’t sit at a different desk doing the same thing just to get paid for it.!#@p!#@Library Desk Worker!#@p!#@This is pretty much the same as above, but the schedules are a little more strict and the tasks are more library/tech-based than grabbing mail.!#@p!#@To my knowledge, the libraries hire at the start of each term, but any open roles can be found here.!#@p!#@Blogger!#@p!#@You know this one (it’s this)!!!#@p!#@We write blogs at our own pace through WordPress, have a Slack to ask questions/make casual fun of each other, and meet every other week in the Admissions Office for an official meeting (with INTENSE snacking involved).!#@p!#@In an effort to not seem biased, I shan’t list too many benefits, but there are no complaints.j We have very flexible hours/work. Bloggers are expected to post roughly twice a month, but there are no hard deadlines/angry bosses/lives lost if you push back a post. We post how ever much we want, pretty much whenever we want.!#@p!#@But, being a blogger is competitive, dare I say? Bloggers have to apply and be chosen to join, and this only happens once a year over the summer. It’s great! but not the most immediate/accessible option!#@p!#@Base Pay: $18.00/hr of writing or meeting!#@p!#@Find more about last year’s blogger admissions process here and the experience in this post.!#@p!#@Tour Guide!#@p!#@This is pretty self-explanatory, and common across colleges. MIT has some of its undergraduates give tours around campus while sharing their experience and memories, while taking questions.!#@p!#@This is easy because there’s not a lot to learn? You know you’re way around, so the hard part is just making sure everyone follows you. Also everything happens during normal working hours. MIT doesn’t give (official) tours around campus at midnight, so being a tour guide shouldn’t affect your sleep schedule/workload/time to do work at night.!#@p!#@Warning: mild cardio and talking to people is required. Also, this follows USPS rules, so unless the weather is so bad you’ll die, you’re giving that tour in snow/sleet/hail/mild hurricane.!#@p!#@Base Pay: $18.00/hr!#@p!#@Find out more about being a tour guide here.!#@p!#@Makerspace/Breakerspace Trainer!#@p!#@MIT has both Makerspaces and Breakerspaces that are run by students for students to, bluntly, make or break things. Students who have already undergone training (among other requirements) are able to train other students and/or monitor the use of the spaces. It’s like lifeguarding, but for science.!#@p!#@Find out more about Makerspace and Breakerspace!#@p!#@Tech Caller!#@p!#@Tech Callers are current MIT students who call out on behalf of the school to speak with alumni about their experience and ask for donations to the university. This is meant to serve as a more personal way for MIT to connect with alumni for donations.!#@p!#@Benefits include free food, low flexible hours, and a  Severance-styled⁠07 rewards system for who raises the most, including everything from shirts to movie tickets to an entire iPad.!#@p!#@Still, you have to call people older than you and ask for money, so there’s all that!#@p!#@Base Pay: $18.00/hr!#@p!#@Find out more about Tech Callers here.!#@p!#@Grading!#@p!#@Students whom have previously received an A/A+ in a class might be asked to be a grader for future semesters. It changes depending on the class and professor, but students are given psets/other homework for the class that they can grade according to a provided rubric/answer guide, and then return to the class TA’s within a certain time period.!#@p!#@Fortunately, this isn’t super labor intensive. A lot of graders I know will do it late at night or when they have a spare couple minutes to grade a few psets. The mental strength and effort it not that of a UROP, per se.!#@p!#@Base Pay: $16.00-$18.00/hr depending on the subject.!#@p!#@Find out more about being a math⁠08 grader here.!#@p!#@TA!#@p!#@Similar to graders, some courses ( 8.01,⁠09 8.02,⁠10 and sometime 7.01x⁠11 sections) have undergraduate TA’s. For physics, these are students who sit at the tables in the TEAL classroom⁠12 with the students as they work to help them with practice problems/answer questions.!#@p!#@Base Pay: $19.00/hr, plus $0.50/hr for each semester!#@p!#@Information Systems and Technology!#@p!#@There’s already a whole post about this–read it here!!#@p!#@Freelance SWE/Web Dev!#@p!#@This is not MIT-specific, but I’ve heard of a lot of computer science kids being freelanced to make the websites of start-ups/small businesses that maybe don’t have the same web development skills of an MIT student. This is pretty niche and it might be hard to find people, but if you have skills, use them!!#@p!#@Run MIT things? (science olympiad, ring premier, tech reunions, etc.)!#@p!#@MIT will often recruit students to run events on campus. These are most often mass-emailed to students, with different jobs for different rates at different times, but looking at the Events Calendar and emailing the organizers is an easy way to find out if they need any paid help for set-up/take-down.!#@p!#@Blackboard Cleaning!#@p!#@Some professors (I think 18.03 this semester??) will pay students $10 if they clean all of the whiteboards in 10-250 or 26-100⁠13 before they start.!#@p!#@Benefits:!#@p!#@Cons:!#@p!#@Lab Studies!#@p!#@In the middle of so much research, some human subjects are needed. Often individual lab websites will post calls for subjects with different compensation for the project. This is pretty tame, with almost nothing requiring more than an hour or two at a time over some period. If you care about privacy or random side effects, though, approach cautiously? (except no data gets leaked and to my knowledge nothing dangerous is tested on volunteers)!#@p!#@Everything Else!#@p!#@Anything else I didn’t mention (random tutor requests, people in the community needed a college student for literally anything) can be found on MIT’s official student job board through Student Financial Services, which you can peruse here.!#@p!#@That’s it, so go rise and grind and get that coin or something 💸💸💸!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-make-money-at-mit/
happy LFDOC! by Emiko P. '25,my last semester of undergrad :),by Emiko P. '25,"February 3, 2025","Today marks my last first day of classes (LFDOC!) as an undergrad at MIT. This semester feels particularly special for a number of reasons. Namely:!#@p!#@Because of these unique facts, which have not been present in any of my other 7 semesters, this semester is one that I can do whatever I want with.!#@p!#@So, here are some thoughts swirling in my brain that I want to document, especially because I am lucky to have more-than-the-usual amount of freedom this semester. It’ll be fun to reflect on how I thought it was going to go versus how it actually went when it’s all said and done. Maybe you should also write something like this and reflect when the school year is over!!#@p!#@Blog once a week. This is a crazy goal, but I think it’s achievable because I have a lot more I still want to share with you all.!#@p!#@Try new forms of athletics.!#@p!#@Soccer. Even though I won’t play another official college soccer game, my time with the team is not over yet. We have many more games of pickup, lifts, and spring scrimmages this semester, and it’s been nice to remember that there is always more soccer to be played :)!#@p!#@Side quests. I want to explore and embrace spontaneity with my friends, like going to Celtics games, exploring a new part of Beacon Hill, leaving Boston for a little weekend trip in New York or New Hampshire, getting tickets to a last-minute concert, etc.!#@p!#@Being present. I keep thinking about the future so dang much. Where will I travel this summer? How will I navigate my life in Japan⁠01 7 months from now? What do I want my career to look like? It’s good to plant seeds to prepare for those moments and it’s also fun to muse about them, but I want to make sure I enjoy how awesome life is right now!⁠02!#@p!#@Classes. I have no more requirements to graduate, so I am taking the following classes out of pure interest, which is a luxury I’ve never fully had before!!#@p!#@I’m really looking forward to this last semester – diving into new topics and interests, spending time with my friends, working out in new and old ways, and basically just living it up.

It feels wrong to admit this as an MIT student, but I had no clue what a hackathon even was, let alone how I could be useful. All we knew is that we would be checking in on the students from our school and offering advice; otherwise, we’d be in for quite a bit of down time.!#@p!#@But, not ten minutes upon arrival, we were asked: “You’re the MIT Students, right?

One group presented an extreme affinity for chairs, another dreamed of creating a solar vehicle, yet another that came up with a masochistic box 05 . The mission was to convey the sense that the sky was the limit: that any progress made within three days wouldn’t even hold a candle to how far they could get if they committed a month, or, say, a year towards their vision.!#@p!#@Evidently, an event like this takes a lot of care and coordination to put together. One of the coolest things was seeing that local participants from previous years would come back to serve as mentors or distribute materials, helping share part of the effort. The more hands on deck, the better. Learning this, I should’ve known that showing up in my MIT MechE merch would invite some conversation.!#@p!#@So I confirmed that I was, indeed, down to be thrown directly into the fire— thus launching what I call my GTL x Edgerton Center crossover episode. Supriya and I integrated ourselves as best we could into the team— already a very well oiled machine. Before long, we were committing to earlier wakeup times, telling our school that we’d be staying on site later. A year before, I was a prospective Course 20 06 who had barely even touched a tool. Now, I was spending an entire day overseeing the mechanical room, equipped with a fanny pack of exacto knives and troubleshooting construction errors. Every time I had the opportunity to help out, I found myself wanting to do so without hesitation. Despite having zero obligation to, I happily embraced the chaos. But why?!#@p!#@Honestly, I fully believe it was the energy of the Edventures team: from the conversations I had with them to the love I could tell they held towards their project, towards each other. In Spain, my life got the chance to intersect with people I never would have met otherwise. While I knew this would happen with my host family, I didn’t expect this sort of thing to happen with people from my very own school. As small as people like to say MIT is, there’s a lot of people— particularly beyond your course number or your living community— that you may never cross paths with. I’m glad that, this time around, I chose to embrace it.!#@p!#@The night of the last day, the team decided to celebrate together.!#@p!#@“Que causalidad— or how do you say it in English?”!#@p!#@“What a coincidence, isn’t it?”!#@p!#@“No, no, that’s casualidad. I mean causalidad. It happened for a reason.”!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-01-at-3.04.22 PM-400x224.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/another-postcard-from-gtl-spain/
Where the Free Things Are by Richard O. '28,A List of Free Opportunities and Tools for Students,by Richard O. '28,"January 30, 2025","Being able to experience new things is such a fundamental part of growing up and with the increasing interconnectedness of our world, it’s now easier than ever to share new information with others. But despite this, there are so many barriers that make finding learning opportunities difficult for those who may not even realize the immense potential of resources out there. Whether it be costs, school funding, or even awareness of these opportunities, there are so many things that can limit the use of tools that people can use to explore new things or study different subjects.!#@p!#@So for a while now, many discussions have been going on within a number of communities for minorities here on campus about ways that we as a school can support those who may not have easy access to the numerous educational opportunities out there. So with the help of many other students from those communities, I’ve put together this blog that details a non-exhaustive list of 100% free opportunities that students can take advantage of as we start the new year.!#@p!#@But I also want to note that while it might be tempting, trying to overload yourself by doing ALL of these things may not be the best course of action, especially if your goal in doing so is to apply to a school like MIT. As Petey wonderfully notes in his infamous “Applying Sideways” blog, it’s more important that you do things you love when it comes to college applications than trying to do too much of stuff you don’t. And one of my favorite quotes from the blog that resonated with me so much during high school was:!#@p!#@So as you glance through this list, feel free to make a note of tools and opportunities that you feel you might actually enjoy taking advantage of or even opportunities you don’t know anything about but seem exciting to you. Definitely don’t, however, use this as a checklist of things you have to do to get into a college because then you’ve got the wrong idea.!#@p!#@Table of Contents:!#@p!#@[♥ – Hearts denote resources that I personally love]!#@p!#@This section features a list of websites and YouTube channels you can use to either self-study or supplement your learning in a class.

But money should never be something that prevents you from going to a school you love, so this section features a number of programs, resources, and lists to scholarship applications that can help you pay for college.

So this is a list of those programs:!#@p!#@List of some summer programs offered by Boston University in addition to PROMYS!#@p!#@List of Fly-In Programs that focus on underrepresented groups!#@p!#@And of course, there are many things out there that I can’t fit in a single blog post, so while I plan an update to this post sometime in the future, I highly encourage you to keep exploring the internet for opportunities and websites that excite you.

the blogs at twenty by Ceri R. '16,"some reflections, plus an index of posts",by Ceri R. '16,"January 29, 2025","Last August, the MIT Admissions blogs turned twenty. Over the past week, we (belatedly) celebrated by asking a bunch of former bloggers to come back and blog for us—just like we did for the tenth blogiversary. In case you missed them,⁠01 here’s an index of their entries from most to least crufty:!#@p!#@College—and particularly undergrad—is a liminal space, or at least I experienced it that way. You’re immersed in a fragment of the world that’s constructed to help you become yourself for four(ish) years, before you stumble into whatever’s next and continue, well, becoming. The MIT Admissions blogs are a special corner of the internet because, for over twenty years now, they’ve allowed everyone to peer into the lives of MIT students who have decided to share their journeys of becoming.⁠02 And after bloggers receive their diplomas alongside their peers and take that next step…they log off.⁠03!#@p!#@What I have loved about reading these posts—and I have truly loved them, and all that I have learned about other bloggers and myself this past week—is that they are intergenerational in a way that the day-to-day blogs can never be, by the very nature of this four-year university model. These thirty-four bloggers⁠04 are all at different points in their lives, pursuing different milestones, and feeling different (though sometimes parallel) big feelings. And the one thing that tethers them⁠05 all is being a blogger for MIT.!#@p!#@I am too tired⁠06 to do any sort of quantitative analysis of the blogs beyond counting these thirty-four recent posts. But, qualitatively, I can say that these 20 years of blogs have fostered a community unlike any other I have experienced in person or online.!#@p!#@When we first sent out the email inviting alums to blog, I genuinely wasn’t sure of the response we’d get. It’s a cold email in the middle of January and the social internet looks vastly different than it did one, five, ten…much less twenty years ago. A couple people responded; we sent out a bump; a couple more said they’d try to write something. My secret mental goal was to try and get at least seven posts, so we could have one for each day of the week of the challenge.!#@p!#@But as we started posting, more bloggers reached out and offered to write something. Still more chimed in with a “hello” over email, even though they didn’t feel like writing publicly for one reason or another. I ended up posting three or four tremendously thoughtful blogs a day, and felt guilty as soon as they spilled over onto the second page of the blog archives—and then the third. Every writer needs a different kind of activation energy, but somehow this inspiration fanned outward, enveloping more and more bloggers and imbuing them with a spark. Even if we have never met in person, or never read each others’ writing at length before, the creativity seemed to energize everyone—even the current bloggers, who were asked to hold off on posting until this challenge was over.!#@p!#@Maybe it only felt this magical to those of us in the greater blogger community. Maybe it felt like a warm hug to you all, too. I don’t know if the distinction particularly matters, because I know what it felt like to me, and isn’t that enough?!#@p!#@Petey ended his 2014 post with some musings about the future, and as a former CMS major, I feel compelled to leave my own time capsule, too.!#@p!#@In 2025, the social media channels feel even more fractured than before. Sure, the prevalence of platforms like Instagram and TikTok can’t be ignored, but conversations and connections are occurring through newsletters (or Patreons and other semi-to-completely-paywalled platforms), Discord servers, and even more decentralized spaces. Our bloggers are carefully distancing themselves from performative posting, regardless of the platform, and they’re thinking about the ways their attention is fractured online.!#@p!#@Fewer people are commenting on the MIT Admissions blogs than the heyday of 2004, but the blogs are still here to greet prospective applicants who are looking to learn more about what their lives could become here. Are there conversations happening elsewhere? Almost certainly, with the ever-increasing stress around college applications. Are those conversations engaging with the nuance of any school being a place where you could become yourself, or the nebulous nature of young adulthood? Maybe not as much as they could be, if all students read these blogs instead of worrying within their echo chambers. But what do I know?!!#@p!#@I know that we’re still missing ways to reach incredibly kind and passionate students who have never heard of MIT before, and that our office is working very hard to help these students understand what MIT is and feel like they could belong here. I know that with Petey as the Director of Communications and Special Projects, whatever strategies come next will center community, student wellbeing, and joyful play, because those are the kinds of spaces he works so hard to curate, and that he curates so well. I know that the Class of 2029 will come to MIT (or go to any number of other colleges) and learn, and grow, and stumble, and change their worlds in little ways—which, as I get older, I think is the key to changing The World in not-so-little ways.!#@p!#@Thank you to everyone who has read, or written, or commented on these blogs. Onward to the next 20 years!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-blogs-at-twenty/
Affirmations by Paige B. '24,not unnecessary,by Paige B. '24,"January 29, 2025","In one of the very few blog posts I wrote before MIT, I wrote:!#@p!#@I am good at math.!#@p!#@I was terrified of putting this thought out into the world. Hell, I followed the sentence up with a number of caveats all to the effect of: Yes, I do know there are people who are immensely better than I am at math in every possible category of “betterness.” (Does such an objective ranking of “betterness” exist? Would such a ranking even be useful for any real purpose? I don’t think so, though this isn’t the point; I wrote it when I was 17. I digress.) But regardless, I typed the thought, hit post, and put it out into the world.!#@p!#@I am good at math.!#@p!#@When I read this sentence now, I wonder what value, if any, such a statement has. I’ve discussed this blogpost idea with a number of other mathematics graduate students, nearly all of whom agree: making such a statement isn’t wrong, but they would never say it themselves. At this point in my life, I think I agree. When I try to be as objective as I can (a lost cause, as a subjective being), the sentence just feels… braggy. Unhelpful. Unnecessary.!#@p!#@Listen, I didn’t believe that sentence was true when I made that blog post 5 years ago. When I was 17, all I knew was that I didn’t know anything. I didn’t know what college would be like. I didn’t know if I was prepared for how hard MIT would be. I didn’t know if I could even remotely be someone good at math.!#@p!#@But I knew that I wanted to be. I wanted to have this utter confidence to walk into my first class and sit in the front row like the nerd I am. I wanted to not carry this fear of being seen as dumb in homework sessions. I wanted to believe that I was someone who could feel good at something.!#@p!#@In this way, I wrote out the sentence!#@p!#@I am good at math!#@p!#@not as a declaration, but an affirmation.!#@p!#@At 17, I didn’t know much, but I knew MIT would be really hard. I also knew that MIT would only get harder if I didn’t believe in myself. If I didn’t let myself try my best for fear of failing. If I didn’t let myself be seen as dumb in homework sessions. So… I faked it.!#@p!#@a) My first year I went straight into my meeting with my academic advisor and (essentially) said “These are the classes I want to take. I think I have the prerequisites. It’ll be hard, but I want to try. Give me a shot and you’ll see—I will try my goddamn best.” And there was a moment when, frankly, I didn’t know how he’d respond. There was some part of me that thought he’d turn around and say “That sounds absurd, take these classes instead” or “Who do you think you’re kidding” or something to that effect. But he didn’t.!#@p!#@He gave me a shot, approved my classes, and (essentially) said!#@p!#@Give it your best.!#@p!#@At the end of that semester, I went back to him with grades I was proud of, and a new absurd class schedule to attempt in the spring. He later became my academic advisor for the rest of undergrad, and he even wrote one of my letters of recommendation to graduate school.!#@p!#@b) That fear of being seen as dumb? Well, that went straight out the window when I went to my first office hour and terribly mispronounced a mathematician’s name to the professor (Dirichlet, if you’re interested—the mathematician whose name I butchered, not the professor). From that point on, I just stopped caring about making a fool of myself. I just… decided to accept that the best learning happens when you open yourself up to the opportunity of being seen as an idiot.!#@p!#@And, much to my shock, I made friends in that process.!#@p!#@My PSET⁠01 group and I made a pact: if we spent an hour or two before office hours carefully refining our “foolish” questions into something reasonable to ask an MIT professor, I’d volunteer to ask whatever questions emerged. What resulted was a series of office hours, week after week, of my friends and I going and asking the questions we needed to ask to learn the material and pass the class.!#@p!#@What’s shocking about this to me, is that this just felt right. I knew how I learned best (e.g. asking potentially dumb questions in office hours), and others responded well to that. I was able to exist in this space in a way that I needed to. In a way that best supported my mental health, and gave me the opportunity to learn and get better at math. In a way that allowed me to be me. I guess I was just shocked that this wasn’t seen as a foolish, isolating, endeavor.!#@p!#@Hell, I made friends in that process. Friends who learned that we liked/didn’t like pure math together. Friends who were open to conversations about pedagogy and education and mathematical communication. Friends who lifted each other up; who made each other feel like we were, or at the very least could be,!#@p!#@Good at math.!#@p!#@That wasn’t easy to find, but “faking it” sure helped.!#@p!#@I clung to that affirmation whenever I found myself struggling in my classes. I’d tell myself– my classmates– my friends: “Right now you’re learning something new, and that’s hard to do, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it.”!#@p!#@I used that affirmation to push back against toxic norms in math. When someone would say that a question was “easy” or “trivial” or “obvious” I’d respond: “Well clearly it’s not, because someone’s asking the question in the first place. And even if there is a simple explanation, that’d be a better response than calling the question ‘easy.’”!#@p!#@I needed that affirmation to make it through MIT. So no, I guess I wouldn’t (subjectively) say that it was “unnecessary.”!#@p!#@For one thing, it feels lonely as hell. Sure, idealistically, everyone should just know that everyone’s just trying their best. But that doesn’t inherently stop the feelings of inadequacy, either due to internal or external reasons. That doesn’t magically create the space you need to exist in the ways you need to exist. That doesn’t stop you from constantly asking yourself if you’re even remotely good at this.!#@p!#@Sometimes it just feels like people are taking chances on me, and I don’t know why. At what point in high school was I able to convince someone that I should be admitted to MIT? At what point in undergrad did I become someone who could get paid to research pure math? At what point did I stop faking it? Did I ever?!#@p!#@And these questions just repeat in a loop in my brain. Sometimes, it feels like the loop never stops. But sometimes, there’s a brief silence. A glimpse of clarity. A moment of feeling like I could be a goddamn mathematician.!#@p!#@Not because I resolved some massive open problem, or because I feel like an Expert™ in some topic. Not because I feel like I am!#@p!#@Good at math,!#@p!#@but because I can feel small ways in which, by “faking it,”!#@p!#@I’ve gotten better.!#@p!#@The moments when I needed that affirmation in undergrad were often associated with questions of sustainability. Moments where I couldn’t help but feel like “Listen, I know that learning new things is hard, but at what point is it too hard? Am I trying too hard? At what point does it get easier? Does it ever?” But I held out hope that one day things, perhaps small and insignificant things, would feel easier.!#@p!#@It wasn’t easy to hold out hope. I felt like I was being too optimistic—too naive—to know better. As if, I was too young to understand just how brutal mathematics can be. As if, I was lying to myself by using idealistic pedagogical beliefs along the lines of “Practice makes better.” As if, it was an inescapable fact of the world that life was meant to always be exactly this hard, and that no one else felt the same.!#@p!#@But, as I said, there have been brief moments where I don’t feel this way. Where, for a moment, my optimism doesn’t feel like blatant naivety.!#@p!#@Like, this last summer when I worked at MathROOTS for the first time (a mathematics summer camp run by MIT’s math department for high schoolers). At this camp, there were moments where I just knew how to exist within this (mentorship? educational? social?) space. Where years and years of being interested in education and thinking about math communication came to fruition.!#@p!#@I don’t want to go terribly into the weeds with the dozen or so moments that made me feel this way at the camp, but I will give one specific mundane example. There was one night where another mentor and I were giving feedback on the practice problems students had turned in. After you finish giving feedback, you’re supposed to put the papers in alphabetical order. And my friend, an amazing colleague and educator, started going through the papers one at a time to do so. Looking for papers with a last name starting with A… then with B… and so on. And I have spent years alphabetizing papers for teachers—hell, I used to do so in my second grade class during recess. So, I politely asked my friend for the papers, and quickly alphabetized them in one hand (if you’re interested, using an insertion sort algorithm).!#@p!#@And it’s dumb. This moment shouldn’t matter. And yet, I couldn’t drop this feeling of just utter exhilaration. Like, it was something I was good at, or at the very least it was something I had gotten better at.!#@p!#@After the exhilaration wore off, my first thought was: I am good at this.!#@p!#@This was immediately followed-up with: You shouldn’t think such things. You shouldn’t think such things because it makes you an ass. You shouldn’t think such things because it’s important to be humble. You shouldn’t think such things because it’s taboo. You should just be happy that you are trying your best, and everyone knows that everyone is just trying their best, so such thoughts shouldn’t be thought in the first place.!#@p!#@Sometimes, I worry that I’m working too hard.⁠02!#@p!#@I’ve thought this time and time again since I’ve started graduate school. And let me be clear, I have loved graduate school so far. But I would be remiss to point out that it has taken work to love graduate school. I have three amazing advisors, all of whom care deeply about education and mentorship and beautiful mathematics. Hell, if they didn’t, I wouldn’t want to be their student. Hell, if I didn’t care deeply about those things either, I don’t know if they’d even want me to be their student.!#@p!#@But because I care about those things, I know what I need to be able to exist in this space in the ways that I need to. I know, at least somewhat, how I like to learn, and collaborate, and exist. And yet, when I started graduate school, I thought that I’d have to throw all that out the window.!#@p!#@When I imagined what graduate school would be like, I pictured reading papers til the sun rises. I imagined attempting to solve problem after problem only to be told that such exercises were “trivial.” I thought I’d have to take on toxic mindsets regarding math I had long since dismissed because they didn’t make me happy.!#@p!#@And I won’t go so far as to say that this isn’t some people’s graduate school experience. I am certain there are mentorship horror stories echoed by thousands of students from around the world. But I knew that I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to passively take on the role of “hardened and unfeeling and purely objective mathematician” (a role, thatI am nearly certain, doesn’t exist in actuality).!#@p!#@But it’s hard to dismiss this nagging feeling that, at times, such a role would be easier.!#@p!#@Last semester, I put in a lot of work into learning to love graduate school. To learn that it was okay for me to exist in this space in the ways that I most need to. Which meant, talking to my advisors about such questions. Giving them the opportunity to prove me wrong. To prove that it’s not naive to have such conflicting feelings about the road of academia I chose to go down. And, to my (perhaps, in this way, naive) surprise, they did prove me wrong.!#@p!#@I told them how, sometimes, it feels like I’m hurting my career in moments where I focus on my mental health. In moments where I prioritize advocacy and education work. In moments where I put myself first. To which they (essentially) said “Is it really hurting your career to do what you need to do? To put energy into the things you care about? To exist in the ways you need to exist?” And, for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel so naive.!#@p!#@In one of the few blog posts I make before I return to MIT, I will type the thought, hit post, and put it out into the world.!#@p!#@I am not naive.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/affirmations/
rearview reflections by Waly N. '24,newly-minted cruft rambles on post-mit life,by Waly N. '24,"January 28, 2025","Somedays, I check to make sure my diploma is real and I didn’t just dream the whole thing. I get a little bit jumpscared when I get an alumni newsletter. It doesn’t really feel like it meant for me, though, somehow, it is. I’ve been getting MIT emails saying “please donate 👉🏿🥺👈🏿” which I cannot mentally process. I’ve been an MIT Educational Counselor⁠01 for this application season, and being on the other side of the table feels both intriguing and odd.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mv5bnzazywmxymitztc2nc00ymu5lwe1otitmdbinmmwnjfimgu2xkeyxkfq_ujjt-2483798810.jpg]!#@As one of the least crufty of the cruft (for now 😳), I wasn’t too sure what to write about. I don’t have some great life wisdom to share or huge post-MIT takeaways. Or career pivots, self-discovery in a new hobby, or newfound interest in underwater basket weaving. I’m pretty similar to myself at graduation other than some variance in my Spotify playlists, experiencing the horrors of apartment hunting, and figuring out how to use a dishwasher. Not entirely certain if I have conceptualized being crufty or an alum for the matter. I last blogged in June,⁠02 which has been a while, but considering how many hiatuses I went on as a blogger, it also doesn’t feel like it.!#@p!#@When I was graduating, my emotions revolved in a pretty binary fashion between WOOOOO I’M DONE 🥳 and *crying while packing my boxes*.⁠03 Being a bit removed from MIT and having some time to sit back and just think, I’ve been reflecting a bit about undergrad while keeping in mind that hindsight is 20/20. Or whatever my current prescription is since my eyes are very far from perfect.!#@p!#@After spending pretty much all of my conscious years of existence in schooling of some sort, working a job has let me dwell a bit on this. This led to me commuting home one day and making a short list of things I missed about MIT and things I’m happy to be leaving in the past. Honorable mentions included missing having access to MISTI/global opportunities or makerspaces and not missing sharing a bathroom or living in a 115 sq ft brick oven coffin (Macgregor <3). I wound up elaborating on just a few while spilling tea while drinking tea in a tea shop with a friend.!#@p!#@the low barrier of entry to try new things in college (missed)!#@p!#@Let’s say I want to learn how to do Pogo sticking for a new, outside-of-work challenge. I could go buy a Pogo stick if I wanted to and learn via YouTube, as one of my friends said when I posed this terrible, terrible hypothetical idea. But chances are, I probably would like to take a class so that I don’t break my neck and suffer an untimely demise. But then a class costs money o__o, and I need to find a place that actually can make a living off Pogo stick classes to offer them to begin with. If I’m a student, and we have a Pogo sticking club, it probably isn’t too difficult to try it out at the beginning of the semester, see if I like Pogo sticking or not, and then continue from that point.!#@p!#@This example is a bit of a hyperbole and idealistic. I don’t think we even have a Pogo sticking group @ MIT, but I wouldn’t be very surprised if we did.  But hopefully, it barely gets the idea across.!#@p!#@I miss having pretty easy access to trying new things (whether it be languages, sports, or niche hobbies) and having it require relatively low travel time or monetary cost, along with being easy to find and join. To try out a new hobby as a “working adult,”⁠04 it can feel like you have to get some initial equipment/tools and potentially travel far to a place. And then, you might not be certain you actually like x or y. You might be able to find a community that enjoys doing [insert hobby], but that can be hard to find at first in a new city. It’s still worth it in the end to try new things, but I wish I appreciated more the sheer access I had to a ridiculous variety of extracurriculars just a few months ago.!#@p!#@academic stress & work-life balance difficulties (not missed)!#@p!#@During undergrad, I often struggled with being able to “rest.” There was always something I could be doing, perhaps even something I should be doing. So my relaxing didn’t feel very relaxing, and it was hard to actually turn my head off. I assume for some people that comes easier (and for others, perhaps harder), but with a nice load of executive dysfunction, I was having the time of my life.!#@p!#@Now, working a job, I find that it is way easier to have a semblance of work-life balance and actually feel relaxed doing whatever it may be after I’m done with the workday. I haven’t taken part in too many hobbies since moving to the West Coast in the fall, but when I have, I’ve found more fulfilment in them. I feel that it comes down to two key things for me.!#@p!#@First, not living in the same place as I “work” (whether that be studying or working) helps a lot. When moving after MIT, I planned to not live ~too~ close to my office since I wanted to quite literally feel that work-life separation. I do work remotely sometimes, which may defeat the point a bit, but mentally, I still find it a bit helpful. If I lived, let’s say, a 5-minute walk away from the office, I wouldn’t be able to create that same disconnect in my head. I guess this could have somewhat been achieved through not living on campus during undergrad, but I enjoyed living on campus for a lot of other social reasons, so I wouldn’t ultimately change that. If I ever found myself in grad school, I think I might try something similar to what I’m doing now.!#@p!#@Second, and arguably more helpful, is having two laptops. One is my personal laptop, which I got in the fall after my previous one bit the dust with 2 days left in my senior spring, and the other is my corporate laptop. Having a work laptop and my personal laptop is an absolute game-changer in creating that distinction in my life. When I’m doing work stuff, I can just do that and not have as many other distractions grabbing my attention. And when I’m doing personal stuff, I don’t have work notifications appearing on my laptop. I just learned by accident ~ a month ago that there is a feature on Windows to create two “desktops,” which might have been helpful to do back as a student. Would I have actually done it, probably not :P!#@p!#@close proximity to friends (missed)!#@p!#@The concept of distance from friends changed a lot for me after graduating. What felt far during college, is something I could, in some sense, only dream for now. It was like, oh no, I live in East Campus and you live in Next House, what a tragedyyyy. Sooooo far apart :(. I have to walk a mile…!#@p!#@Except now it is like oh I live on the West Coast and you live on the East Coast, what an actual tragedy. I need to go to an airport, catch a flight, and get from the airport to wherever. I miss having rather close proximity to people I was both close friends with and more casual friends with. The fact that people I lived really close to (in retrospect) are now spread out so far is a bit of a surreal concept for me still, even though it has been quite a few months since graduation.!#@p!#@Like most people at MIT, I moved away from home for college, but it wasn’t very far for me all things considered, since I lived ~4 hours away on a bus. I was a bit far from my high school friends, but holidays usually brought us back to the same place. Being cross-country from friends who also have families in other cities is definitely a different vibe. If I wanted to take a bus and visit my friends not on the West Coast, I would be likely to need a spine and hip replacement by the time the bus makes it across the country. I don’t think such a bus even exists, though, in theory, I could take Amtrak for like 80 hours.!#@p!#@boston cold temps + wind tunnels (not missed)!#@p!#@Boston winters are cold. The winters when I was at MIT weren’t too bad (but I also never spent an IAP on campus between COVID and doing GTLs), but I still didn’t particularly enjoy the temperatures either. Boston also tends to be pretty windy, and it probably also deserves the title of “Windy City” considering it is the only place that has absolutely demolished my umbrella(s).!#@p!#@I currently live in Seattle, and Seattle’s winter is so calm and mild compared to Boston. It isn’t ever really below freezing, it just is a bit gray and rainy sometimes. I don’t really mind that, and I do feel people in the city are a bit dramatic about the doom and gloom. But, it is possible I’m just seeing one of the nicer winters and will swallow my words next year. The fact that there is generally no wind chill, as someone from the East Coast, is also pretty surprising since the temperatures you see are how it actually feels. Compared to seeing 23F on the East Coast and realizing it actually feels like 15F…!#@p!#@More widely, I feel similarly about Boston and Seattle as cities. They both aren’t New York, but they have their charm in their own unique ways. I love the greenery here, especially since a lot of the trees as evergreens and keep the winter days a bit more colorful.!#@p!#@can’t go MIA from responsibilities™️(missed)!#@p!#@More times than I would like to admit, I woke up for a lecture, questioned the meaning of life, and went back to bed. I then woke up later, a bit more refreshed but still sleepy, and then finally dragged myself to the next class on my schedule.!#@p!#@At the start of every semester, I knew that if I fell into the trap of missing just one lecture of a class, it was bound to snowball into missing a lot more than just one lecture. Especially if the class was before 11am. Unless it was a thing that required mandatory attendance, like a lab or small class, I kept falling victim to this somewhat-easily-avoidable-issue-that-I-probably-should-have-done-better-with. I don’t think the body I had in college was the same that commuted an hour-ish each way to high school every day.!#@p!#@Sometimes, by sheer muscle memory, I nowadays wake up, and I’m like ahhhh I’m not feeling it, I’ma skip today. But then it hits me. I CAN’T. Well, I could if I had no concept of impulse control, but then I would probably be on the express route to getting fired, and for good reason. Unless I was actually sick or on leave. So I drag my uncooperating body out of my warm, comfy bed into the cold, harsh world that awaits it.!#@p!#@Do I miss being able to simply be irresponsible sometimes and make bad decisions like skipping lectures? Yes. Am I proud of it? No… Go to lecture y’all o_o!#@p!#@And with that, I return to cruft blogger slumber to ponder on these takeaways some more 🤔!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mv5bnzazywmxymitztc2nc00ymu5lwe1otitmdbinmmwnjfimgu2xkeyxkfq_ujjt-2483798810.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/rearview-reflections/
Thoughts from the Dungeon by kellen manning,One night only,by kellen manning,"January 28, 2025","I’ve been stuck in the same dungeon in Metaphor: Refantazio for the last two weeks.  The most frustrating part of this experience is that every time I turn the game on, it’s a new enemy that sends me to my digital maker. Well, that’s not true. The most frustrating part is that I don’t even need to beat this dungeon to finish the game. I could skip the dungeon and fight the final boss in his airship. Then, the credits would roll, and I could move on with my life. But…no. Mentally, I can’t accept that. So, here I am writing this blog instead.!#@p!#@At first, I was going to skip this blogging challenge. It’s been forever since I’ve written a blog for MIT, and I really don’t have much to contribute.  But I saw everyone else doing it, and then there was an email from Ceri in my inbox this afternoon, and I figured this must be easier than what I’m dealing with in Metaphor. Right?!#@p!#@No. I was wrong. This is my fourth attempt at writing something, and the deadline is so close I can feel its icy breath on the nape of my neck⁠01 . At this point, it’s whatever. I’m finishing something today, and if it’s not the game, then it will be this blog.!#@p!#@So, here I am. Blogging for the first time in three years. A lot has changed on my end. I feel older. You all feel older. Petey has always felt older, so that doesn’t count, and Jeremy is eternally young, so that doesn’t count either.!#@p!#@If I remember correctly, I used to say everyone has their version of MIT. I’m not sure who gave me that saying, but it still holds true. Looking back, my version of MIT was akin to running as fast as I could while trying to come up with as many cool ideas as possible before I hit the finish line. It was fun, and I like to think I’ve been carrying that vibe since I left. I don’t know.!#@p!#@Anyway. Back to the dungeon.!#@p!#@Wish me luck.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts-from-the-dungeon/
"in search of lost time by Alan Z. '23, MEng '24",a cruft joint post with CJ Q. '23,"by Alan Z. '23, MEng '24","January 28, 2025","alan!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ALANCJONEIMAGE-1000x500.jpg]!#@So, in spite of it all, we’re still alive, and we’re still writing. You can’t stop us. I’m fairly convinced that nothing can, except for the sweet and eventual embrace of death that comes for us all. But, at least for now, I’m not too worried about that inevitability.!#@p!#@Some things have changed. CJ lives in New York, where they work for Stainless, a company that helps people who build web applications talk to each other in different programming languages. I live in Seattle now, where I work on power management for Windows. I travel more than I used to, mostly to visit friends who are now spread out across the country. CJ has “maybe gotten into rhythm games,” or something like that.⁠01!#@p!#@Some things have not. CJ and I still do Mystery Hunt, where we both spent three days last weekend just staring at computer screens trying to solve puzzles for “fun.” Last March, we visited every station on the New York City subway in a 29-hour sequel to our MBTA excursion, which we wrote about but never posted. I still occasionally do musical theatre, and CJ still occasionally square dances.!#@p!#@Certainly, however, time has passed.!#@p!#@cj!#@p!#@When people approach an ending, do they act any differently?!#@p!#@For the past seventeen months I’ve been living in New York City, in a cruft house named LoTaD, short for Land of Trees and Darkness, or Land of Time and Destiny, or Land of Takeout and Delivery, or whatever, depending on who you ask. Our apartment’s first set of residents was me, Brian ’23, Ixa ’23, and Jason ’22. Five months ago, Brian moved out of LoTaD to start a master’s in Oxford, and Victor ’23 moved in to replace him.!#@p!#@Brian and I spent a lot of time hanging out after work. We’d watch Make Some Noise or Fantasy High Junior Year on Dropout, or I’d watch him play MTG Arena, or he’d watch me play 汉字大冒险, or we’d discuss Henkinization, or pro-drop, or adjoint functors. By the time Brian was planning his trip to Oxford, we wanted to watch Never Stop Blowing Up together, but we decided not to start it, because we knew we couldn’t finish it before he left. We made plans for watching the episodes together remotely, over Discord calls, and we juggled time zone differences and work hours, and when he left I didn’t know if those plans would come to fruition. He promised that he’d be back in January.!#@p!#@I started working for my previous company seventeen months ago, after interning there the previous year. By then, some of the people I’d loved working with had left, or were on another team, or were on the other coast, and I knew I’d be interacting with them a lot less. There’s a plea my heart sings: If I ever come back, I hope you’ll still be here. Inside the plea is a fear, the fear of coming back to something I once loved, and seeing all the things I loved about it be gone, or worse, different. Different in an unpredictable way. I’d shaken out the initial thought of I might stay here for a few years, and it became I’ll see if I’ll want to leave.!#@p!#@When I see the possibility of an ending, do I act any differently?!#@p!#@alan!#@p!#@Someone recently asked me what activities I did during my undergrad at MIT. I told them “a lot of musical theatre and student government,” and then I stopped. I tried to remember anything else I’d done, because I knew there was more—I mean, after all, I’d been so busy—but nothing came to mind. This realization, that I had forgotten so many activities which were important to me at another time, hit me hard. I’d forgotten the acapella group I’d spent four years in; the quizbowl tournaments I drove my team to; the late nights I spent reading applications for THINK. I’d forgotten so much, even if it was just a momentary lapse.!#@p!#@Maybe my memory’s just not that good, or maybe impermanence is the norm.!#@p!#@The students I now interview for MIT keep asking me, in one form or another, what I got out of the experience, and I try to tell them, but often I get stuck trying to summarize the unsummarizable. How do you describe something that was your whole life for five years? I did things at MIT I couldn’t have imagined going in, and they changed me in ways that I don’t think I’ll ever really be able to explain. I met so many kind, intelligent people who taught me about computer systems and writing and plant biology and topology, but who also taught me how to be kind, how to lead with care, how to not be afraid when facing difficulties of different shapes, how to intentionally and persistently strive to do better.⁠02 And, in one way or another, I did my best to show other people how to do these things as well.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0188-1000x667.jpg]!#@Sometimes during these interviews, I feel like I’m watching that life through a rearview mirror, receding into the distance, growing hazy. It’s not that I’m stuck in the past—I’ve always liked living life looking forward to something, and I’ve got plenty to look forward to. But there are things that will never be again. 3 AM conversations in the dorm lounge about category theory, or inorganic chemistry, or Modernist poetry; writing vocal arrangements and plays for your friends to perform and see; finding fun ways to just waste time with your band as you sit on stage⁠03 during pit rehearsals: maybe they aren’t impossible, but the opportunities for things shaped like this are fewer and fewer. And, as time moves by, I begin to forget what happened, and I wonder if I’m forgetting what I learned, too.!#@p!#@To put it simply: one chapter has ended, and another one has begun.!#@p!#@cj!#@p!#@The etymology of the word end goes through the Proto-Germanic *andijaz, which means “endpoint (front or back)”. Imagine a timeline split into eras or periods, or perhaps imagine the real numbers partitioned into intervals. Each period has two endpoints, the front and the back. Each endpoint touches two periods, the ones before and after. This is a point–line duality, a change of perspective: it’s our choice to view periods separated by endpoints, or upheavals separated by stability.!#@p!#@I knew Victor well, about as well as I knew Brian, and I looked forward to all the things we’d do together, once he’d moved in. We’d go to the square dances that Geo calls up in Jersey City, and take the LIRR to the Round One in Hicksville to play Sound Voltex or Chunithm, and discuss paper-folding algorithms, and pork floss cake roll, and how bad Next.js is. But was it going to be as fun as the time I spent with Brian? I didn’t know. I had a gut feeling though, a feeling that told me not to worry too much about it, so I didn’t.!#@p!#@Another end: when did I realize I wanted to leave my last job? Was it when I started working on other programming things, and realized I wanted to do other kinds of software development? Was it when I heard about the hundredth customer churning? Was it when more people I knew and liked left the company? Was it when I started idly browsing job descriptions, was it when I submitted applications, was it when I told a few coworkers I was considering leaving, was it when I interviewed, was it when I got an offer?!#@p!#@Up until that moment, nothing was set, everything was revocable, and I hadn’t committed. Yet my attitude to work changed. I started closing some outstanding projects, and writing whatever documentation I felt like people would need. I declined picking up long-term tickets, and I came into the office less and less. The behavior kicked in before I realized I was doing it. And when I noticed, I made an excuse: I was taking two weeks off that summer, so checking out was a good idea anyway, whether I left the company or not. But my muscles knew, knew before I did, that the end was coming. This was the immune system response to prevent me from getting too hurt when I leave, or to prepare me for starting a new job in a few weeks.!#@p!#@I took the offer. I told some teammates. I told my manager, and gave a formal notice. I told my manager’s manager. I told more teammates. I got the email from HR. I filled out some forms, scheduled an exit interview, sent an email to the company, got some Slack messages, added some people on LinkedIn, said where I was going. I went on some goodbye calls, I collected all my things from the office, I shipped my laptop back, and that was it. It was over.!#@p!#@An ending can be as long as you want it to be. Circumstances set boundaries, but they aren’t emotional safeguards, they can’t be. You can leave with your head on backwards and arms tucked in, or you can suffer over the temporary and savor the liminality.!#@p!#@A few weeks later, Victor moved into LoTaD, and I started my new job.!#@p!#@alan!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0349-1000x667.jpg]!#@I guess another reason I think about this ending so much is that I never got to say goodbye to MIT in the way I would’ve liked. I finished my master’s over the summer, living alone in Sidney-Pacific,⁠04 doing research all day and sometimes all night, with only a few friends around and just a couple of other distractions. I didn’t finish my thesis until two weeks after I’d moved to Seattle and started my new job, pulling late nights and early mornings to get everything done. In the midst of all this, it was hard to feel like the chapter was actually foreclosed. Maybe it was just on hold, for a while.!#@p!#@This explanation is attractive—after all, those few weeks were very surreal, signing a lease with a roommate from afar without having ever visited the apartment, sitting on a bare mattress in my dorm writing thesis code as movers collected all of my things, showing up to a random office building on the first day still a little bleary-eyed from a late night worksession and unsure about new job etiquette. Yet, I also suspect that true closure is, in some sense, a myth. Endings are never as clear as you’d think, because life is continuous. Who knows whether this is the last time you’ll ever talk to this acquaintance or that one; who knows whether that was the day you forgot their name, or the day before?!#@p!#@When I think about endings, I think about how, in all the productions of musicals I’ve done, I’ve put weeks of effort into doing whatever my part is, and then, in a blink of an eye, whether three or six shows later, it’s gone. It’ll only exist as a memory in the people who happened to be there in that brief and transitory moment, when we agreed to be in a room together, doing or seeing a show. Those endings, too, never feel complete. Those memories, too, will fade. This is just a bigger version of that.!#@p!#@I still keep doing shows, even though they’ll be forgotten, because I enjoy them in the moment, in the process. Because I like putting a smile on people’s faces, especially when I don’t have to be on stage myself.⁠05!#@p!#@Why should any other part of life be any different?!#@p!#@cj!#@p!#@Here’s a confession. All those things I wrote about Brian? Or about leaving my last job? They’re half fiction.!#@p!#@In the trivial sense, my writing can never capture reality, because reality is multidimensional and prose is a restrictive medium. But even if I could perfectly communicate what I want to, there’s a more essential problem: the fallibility of memory. I’m writing this months after those events happened, and I’m not looking at any receipts while doing so.!#@p!#@I see so many things I don’t remember. I see weeks of lived experience collapsed into sentences: “Brian and I spent a lot of time hanging out after work,” or “I started closing outstanding projects, and writing documentation.” I’m reminded of a segment from Matthewmatosis’s Meta Microvideos:!#@p!#@I’ve quoted this before. I almost forgot about that.!#@p!#@The time passed, as it always does. Let me collapse my experience then: Victor moved in, and we spent some great time together; I started my new job, and it’s been treating me somewhat well.!#@p!#@It’s January now. Brian came back, as promised, and we did many of the things we used to do together. We watched stuff, played video games, talked math. We did some new things too. Victor, Brian and I went to Flushing to play rhythm games and get dinner. We left unspoken the fact that Brian was only here for a few days, days we, of course, wouldn’t even spend all together, days that would never really be like the days that we had in the past. Now Brian is gone, and he is back in Oxford, and who knows when we’ll see each other again. It’s only been a few days and I can no longer remember everything we did.!#@p!#@I’m in Boston again, and I’m catching up with people. I talk about my new job, and people ask how it’s different from my old one, and the best I can come up with is the things I work on are more interesting. When people ask about what I disliked about my old job, or when I think about my old job, it’s like I’m running my fingers through sand. I know things must’ve not been great; that’s why I left, right? But how much could I trust that, if I can’t remember the evidence to back it up?!#@p!#@alan!#@p!#@A few months ago, I was listening back through the original campaign of The Adventure Zone, a D&D podcast which I don’t listen to much of anymore. I’ve listened through this campaign a number of times since it was first released in 2017, and as I was writing in my journal, a curiosity struck me to check when the last time I’d listened through was. Looking back, I realized it had only been a year ago, just at the start of the MEng. I wrote:!#@p!#@It was this second thought that was really jarring to me, because it was this sudden indication that I might be measuring the passage of time by “pain incurred.” And, the more I thought about it, the more I realized it might be true. I remember semesters of school by the bad things that happened, by the difficulties I had to overcome, rather than by successes, by accomplishments, by joy, by forward progress. I forget the good things, because once they’ve happened, they become part of who I am, like it’s always been that way. I stop noticing them.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0951-1000x667.jpg]!#@And then I thought, what happens now? It surely can’t be healthy to live forever with pain as a metric of time; to have to struggle and suffer to feel like growth has happened. Surely, now, as life goes on, there must be something else to measure the years by.!#@p!#@I don’t know. I think that’s one of the next questions I’m looking to answer.!#@p!#@cj!#@p!#@A situation can trigger memories of a similar traumatic experience, but it can also trigger memories of a similar wholesome one. MIT’s campus is replete of these delightful reminders, and if I defocused my attention and walked around, I could feel it constantly. The brain doesn’t need to remember everything; the body remembers too. Maybe memory is never cut so cleanly, maybe the details we’ve lost aren’t gone forever, you know?!#@p!#@The Monday after this year’s Mystery Hunt, me and some teammates gathered in a friend’s apartment to play board games. We started at 8 PM, and soon enough the board games stopped, and people moved to sit on the couches and chairs around a coffee table, and talked, for three hours straight. We talked about many things: what people were up to, names, Magic the Gathering, random things people had memorized, square dancing.!#@p!#@Someone later described that whole thing as a dorm-lounge-coded conversation, and that comparison made me pause. It was a dorm-lounge-coded conversation, wasn’t it? One I’ve had hundreds of times in many guises, in the TV Lounge on floorpi,⁠06 one I haven’t had recently. Or maybe, the similar ones I’ve had recently were of different flavors: ones that veered closer to Geoguessr or whatever nonsense the big AI companies are up to. Or maybe, these conversations can only really happen with a critical mass: you need a dozen people, all familiar with each other, all lounging without the pressure of making the most of their time.!#@p!#@I’ll forget about that conversation soon enough. It’ll be a warm patch in the fabric of the past few weeks, and then it’ll be gone. It might be there when I come back, and maybe we’ll trod the same ground again. There are no stakes in having fun. Part of me will remember anyway.!#@p!#@I don’t remember much from reading Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, but I remember one of its arguments: you only live once, so your actions have no meaning, no weight to pull you down. This is in response to the idea of eternal recurrence, put forward by Nietzsche: you will live your life over and over again, so you better be ready to repeat your actions an infinite number of times. Eternal recurrence isn’t a literal fact, but a hypothetical: if I told you that you had to repeat your life forever, what would you feel? If you were given the chance to do it again, in exactly the same way, would you?!#@p!#@If you gave seventeen-year-old me the choice to live his life all over again, he’d have said no. If you asked me now, I might say yes. Hell, I might be living in eternal recurrence right now. I don’t remember the future, but something in my body tells me that it’ll all be worth it.!#@p!#@alan!#@p!#@Maybe the point is this: you’re always changing, even if it feels like you aren’t. Every new memory, every little thing you do changes you, and you just never notice until one day you wake up and you think “that’s not who I used to be.” Sometimes, even that thought disappears, and instead you think “I must have always been this way.”!#@p!#@When life changes suddenly, it puts you off balance, because it reminds you that change does happen. It reminds you that not everything will be as it was, and ever shall be. And, yes, there will be things you lose: memories, friends, skills, opportunities. But there are also things you will keep—and, most importantly, things you will choose to keep. Values and ideas and memories and people that, after years of becoming yourself, you know are too precious to lose.!#@p!#@It is in this sense that life currently feels urgent and exciting to me, this combing of the past to tell me what is important to my present. It is trying to escape this stuckness, trying to take my eyes from the rearview mirror and move them to the road ahead, without forgetting what is behind me. I am holding on to the steering wheel, because there is still so much to look forward to. I am looking forward, because being terrified that I’ll lose the good parts of who I was only makes them more likely to slip away.!#@p!#@And, indeed, I do some new things now, and I am starting to hold them too. I’ve joined a new choir; I’m playing in a symphony orchestra for the first time in five years. I bought a camera and I’ve used it liberally⁠07 to capture moments that speak to me: a silhouette here, a reflection there; a moving car here, a candid smile there.!#@p!#@I keep realizing that I am genuinely quite happy, even if it feels like nothing matters the way it used to; where I’ve suddenly gone from someone who is always making art and organizing activities to someone who works a day job and has hobbies.⁠08 I know, in the long run, the things I’m making likely won’t be noticed or remembered by anyone, including myself, and maybe that’s okay, so long as it changes me, though that won’t stop me from trying.!#@p!#@I guess I’ve been looking for permanence in a world where nothing is permanent, where even mountains, after months and years, centuries and millennia, ebb away. It is time to learn that nothing gold can stay, and that can be okay.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF1260-1000x667.jpg]!#@Perhaps now is the season for change.!#@p!#@cj!#@p!#@And so:!#@p!#@because:!#@p!#@because:!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ALANCJONEIMAGE-1000x500.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0188-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0349-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF0951-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSCF1260-1000x667.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-search-of-lost-time/
You always have been by Cami M. '23,hi everybody!,by Cami M. '23,"January 28, 2025","Dear Reader,!#@p!#@I’m writing this in the WordPress portal and this is an absolute blast from the fucking past. Can I open up by cursing? Is that allowed? One time, in my sophomore year, there was a blogger meeting where I think it was insinuated that content on the blogs was getting maybe somewhat raunchy or vulgar and I cried after the meeting because I thought it was targeted at me. Then, Petey had to message me directly to comfort me and clear things up. Core memory for sure.!#@p!#@Anyway, hi everyone, to those of you who do not know me, my name is Cami and I graduated MIT in 2023. It feels weird and maybe self-serving to say like “You might know me from…” or “I was known for…”, but I’ll fight through it for the sake of the blogposts. I was known on the blogs for having a lot of braindump-type posts that mainly waxed poetic about my time at MIT, both good and bad. My goal was to make it more like journal entries and stamped moments of my life.!#@p!#@I actually look back at my blogs pretty often – then and now, way back then to somewhat then, super way back then to the very current now, etc. I’m always slightly amused seeing what things I was fussing about then, whether it was going through breakups (both freshman and senior year!) or being worried about passing classes or trying to figure out what the future holds.!#@p!#@I look back and read those blogposts and feel just as much as I felt in those moments. The crying, the laughter, the fear – everything. It’s incredibly humbling. As I prepared to write these “cruft” blogs (which Mel so kindly notified me about, thank you Mel), I also dug back into my old MIT email and re-read a lot of the very kind emails readers had sent me through the 4 years I was blogging.!#@p!#@I didn’t quite know what I wanted to write in this blogpost, but I knew to some degree I wanted to give a heartfelt and very full thank you. My senior year, my brain was in a lot of disarray and while I did leave thank you notes, I don’t think they were super complete.⁠01 But thank you for all the kind messages over the years and the opportunities and encouragement and just. Everything. Blogging brought me some of the fondest and best memories I made at MIT, best mentors, best friendships, best experiences, just everything. I owe nearly *everything* to my blogging experience here at MIT. Through it, I learned to be more vulnerable and how to word my feelings and really just feel everything I was feeling. I don’t think I realized how much I relied on writing to feel things, and honestly once I graduated college, I stopped writing and found it a lot harder to feel in touch with my emotions.!#@p!#@Anyway, what have I been up to since then?!#@p!#@Writing this makes me wish I had written one of those “Letter to yourself 5 years from now” when I graduated. Anyway, I am still in fact in New York City working as a product manager for a big tech company. It’s exactly how it sounds. It’s remote so I have a lot of flexibility in my day to day.!#@p!#@Usually, my work just looks like me outstretched on my couch, tip-tapping away at product requirements or to my teammates asking questions about data, etc. It feels very adult. It’s also odd that people look to me for product direction. I’m actually working on a humongous project that I’m super excited about (and feel extremely privileged to take lead on).!#@p!#@I live in a gorgeous, beautiful apartment which I am also grateful to live in. MIT did a great job of setting me up for success and I feel very good about my lifestyle, my home, my hobbies, etc.!#@p!#@I live with my dog and my boyfriend. Yes! I got a dog. He’s the best thing in the world, even if he’s a pain in my ass.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-includes/images/media/video.png]!#@They’re my whole world and I love them with every surface area available of my body and heart.!#@p!#@Yeah, a lot has changed since I graduated. I had a weird last semester where I was trying to find myself and boy howdy, I did! Post-grad life has been an absolute blast, it’s been basically everything I wanted and more.

There’s always something going on in the city and I think it really compliments my brain and the way I think. I hop between a lot of different activities and things I want to try and there’s ALWAYS an opportunity to go do and try those things in the city.!#@p!#@Travel is incredibly important to me. The nice thing about having a fully remote job is that you can really zoom-zoom anywhere and everywhere (with permission, of course). I’ve really made the most of not having to worry about tests or homework or classes and embraced traveling. I think sometimes I travel a bit too much, and it ruins my routine a lot, but I really do feel this urgency to go see things, especially while I still can.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3860-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9003-800x1422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0701-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6159-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1823-800x1067.jpeg]!#@I’ve spent so much of my postgrad life traveling and trying new things and hopping around, but also attempting to be a lot more intentional with my time and how I spend it. I realized I had the income to travel home more often, to see my dad’s side more often, to buy Christmas presents for my family, to go on vacations with my boyfriend and my dog. If you had asked me a year ago what the hardest thing I’ve ever done is, I would’ve said MIT. If you were to ask me that question today, I would say losing my grandmother. I am so grateful for the time I got to spend with her and those last moments. I wrote a whole thing about it on my Substack, and I won’t get into it here, but I really, really have been focusing a lot on building a home, building a family, and maintaining and strengthening my relationship with my family. I’ve tried so hard to cultivate a loving home for my boyfriend, dog, and I and also to fly back home regularly to see my family.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1510-2-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5953-2-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2497-5-800x600.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1225-3-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2422-800x1067.jpeg]!#@I don’t really have pictures to represent these, so bear with me.

I wish I could go back in time and give college Cami a big hug. There were so many times where I wondered what life was going to be like, who I was going to be, where I was going to be. New York was daunting and scary. I didn’t know where I was going to live or what I was even doing in there. And now, I’ve really carved out a spot for myself. I still keep in contact with so many of my college friends, and I really believe I’ve worked hard to try and fashion my life into something I’m proud of.!#@p!#@Obviously, I still have so much future ahead of me, and I don’t know what will come next, but I’m happy to be where I stand, and I look forward to whatever lies ahead!!!!!#@p!#@Much love from Butters and I,!#@p!#@Cami!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-includes/images/media/video.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9906-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4492-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8789-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1420-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1339-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3860-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9003-800x1422.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0701-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6159-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1823-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1510-2-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5953-2-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2497-5-800x600.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_1225-3-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2422-800x1067.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/you-always-have-been/
infinite corridors by Vincent H. '23,can’t believe there are no posts with this title yet,by Vincent H. '23,"January 27, 2025","in the (almost) two years since leaving school, the term “infinite corridor” has taken on new meanings for me. at mit it refers to a long hallway on campus:!#@p!#@but lately when i think about infinite corridors this is the picture i have in mind:!#@p!#@i was so preoccupied during undergrad with picking the best possible version of myself to become – deciding on where to live and who to spend time with and career choices and so on. i thought the world became less malleable the moment you left school, and you can see the anxiety running strong through all my old blogs. these days i’m still a little anxious, but i’ve also realized things are not as set in stone as i imagined: i’ve already switched jobs and roles, signed a new lease, changed my hair and speaking style and health routines and a million other things. the stakes still feel high, but it’s also true that most actions are reversible and sometimes you just need to live longer and collect more experiences before you can really understand your own preferences!#@p!#@from my spiritual awakening:!#@p!#@i’m not saying your seeking is useless. what i mean is that you’re an unfolding process. your seeking is one beautiful, important part. every day changes us. the things we do, the things we see, the people we meet – these all move our process forward. keep seeking. living bundles the kindling. lightning does strike!#@p!#@at a high level my life is not so different from what it was like during school, though of course all the details have changed!#@p!#@the second half of 2023 was absolutely brutal. i was reeling from moving to a new city and living in a house with forty old white men (don’t ask how) and a breakup and feeling incompetent at work and missing my friends and feeling unsafe at night. i felt like i’d been caught completely off-guard by life after school and often wondered if i’d squandered all my time in college, if i was being punished now for spending four years having fun instead of preparing for my future problems. by contrast 2024 was the best year of my life so far – i saw lots of friends and an eclipse and ten new states, my boss helped me figure out how to think about feelings and communication more clearly, i learned more about the kinds of work i enjoy, i finally started taking better care of my physical health, and so on!#@p!#@it’s obviously not true that the new year suddenly made me way better at life. i think what is true is that progress often appears to be either nonexistent or explosive because we don’t have precise ways of measuring anything in between, so the little things accumulate undetected over time and then one day you suddenly feel like a different person. not to be a nerd but in my research there’s a notion that as language models get larger they appear to suddenly acquire new skills, but only because we evaluate skills via discontinuous metrics!#@p!#@even when everything sucked in late 2023 there would be glimmers of progress if i paid close attention – little things, like, i would plan an event or navigate a tricky conversation or write a particularly complex piece of code, and then i would look back and think huh, there’s no way i could’ve done that a few years ago. i’m not good at paying attention to small wins yet, but i think it becomes more important once you leave school and aren’t constantly getting feedback (eg. via grades), and i’d like to get there eventually!#@p!#@from the answer is not a hut in the woods:!#@p!#@when i really look back on it the real adventures were someone you know doing something you don’t expect or trying to remember how you fixed yourself after a blue patch and realizing it was largely thanks to someone standing benevolently in the background of your life and doing it quietly from afar without you even realizing it… perhaps the strangest adventure, perhaps the most humbling one, happens on the inside – discovering those parts of yourself you’ve never acknowledged, jettisoning those parts you’ve never liked and constantly, constantly being aware that you will soon turn into someone else and whoever that is is decided at every moment by you now and in two minutes and two minutes after that until 10 years later, after one very long succession of two minutes you find a new you sitting there and you’re not even sure where they began nor where they’ll end!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/infinite-corridors/
Everything is different now by Mimi S. '22,"That's ok, I have a cat now",by Mimi S. '22,"January 27, 2025","The student blogger named Mimi is a much different person than I am now. For better or for worse, everything about me has changed. I want to start with things that have remained the same since I left MIT. My love of music and anime has been constant. I was shocked at how many of my posts were about Jojo and even more shocked that I’m still just as obsessed with it! The manga’s been getting good and I eagerly await Jojo day each month. My last year at MIT, I spent most of it ignoring school work and playing with synthesizers at the Voxel Lab. It’s cute that old Mimi and I both get so obsessed about things and immediately have to share it with as many people as possible. Although, old Mimi tried a bit too hard to be likable in her posts. She’s not quite as funny as I am. I’ve still got the curiosity and drive and desire to learn as old Mimi. I know old Mimi is quite literally just me from a few years ago, but there are so many parts of her that I don’t like anymore. I don’t like that she’s not very confident and has to act like a different person to try to get people to like her.!#@p!#@Before MIT, I struggled within my shell. I was closed off to others, and too afraid to try and break out. Throughout my four years at MIT, I gradually opened up to people, developed some new hobbies, and really opened up. I played music in front of people for the first time in my life (it was a modular synth techno set, if you were curious). Generally speaking, I was trying new things and slowly stepping out of my shell. I had developed a real confidence in my self for the first time in my life.!#@p!#@When I graduated from MIT, I thought I had a golden ticket. I found a really good job, and an apartment in Boston, and I was ready to finally live my life for the first time. Then the apartment situation fell apart, so I moved back home with my parents. I wasn’t happy about it, but I could navigate that situation pretty well. During that time I met my current girlfriend, and moved in with her. I found a fantastic group of people in my home city. People that had been living there for ages, but that I didn’t meet until after MIT. I got really good at pool, wowing strangers at bars mostly. I was having a pretty good year.!#@p!#@I lost my job after about a year. What followed can only be described as spiral and collapse. That was the longest, coldest, and darkest winter of my life. Within three months, all of the confidence I had developed at MIT was destroyed. I entered a cycle of depression and anger. My relationship was falling apart and I was nowhere closing to finding a job in my field. After several months of this cycle, my girlfriend had reached her breaking point with me. I was inconsiderate, angry, and just generally made life difficult for both of us, and she had enough. She told me something had to change. I had to find something to get out of the house, and not be locked away all day. She suggested that I tried out Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes at a local gym. I resisted. “Oh I’m not athletic, I don’t think i’d like it” “oh its probably expensive” “it’s probably going to be pretty bad for me to show up as a transgender woman”. I pulled back as much as I could, but eventually I gave in. I joined their beginner program.!#@p!#@BJJ was basically my life for the next several months, through the summer and fall. I was never good at it (I’m still not) but it give me meaning again. It gave me confidence. I felt dangerous. I started doing Muay Thai and MMA classes at the same gym. I went to a boxing gym for a little bit too, just so I could keep doing training. Now, I’ve started doing weightlifting in addition to my regular training. Doing that martial arts training basically kept me alive during that dark time.!#@p!#@At the same time, my girlfriend and I had slowly been developing a strong network of friends in the area. So now, I was working out, learning new skills, making new friends, and trying new experiences. In the fall, I ended up starting a new job in the restaurant industry. It’s not really what I want to be doing, but I like everyone I work with and I’ve made even more friends from there. My life from one year ago is vastly different than it is now. My life at MIT from three years ago might as well be a different person entirely. I think the most important lesson i’ve learned from this is that I have to remain open to new experiences all the time. I tried so hard to force my life to be what I wanted, and that just wasn’t happening. It lead to self-destructive tendencies, and generally depression. Once I let go, I felt like I start living my life again. I’m still looking for work in my target industry. I’m not giving up on that. But progress is non-linear.!#@p!#@Here’s a quick list of things I’ve done since graduating:!#@p!#@Highly recommend reading my Jojopost if you haven’t.

I’m Still Here (for now) by Sabrina M. '21,quick reflections on the last ten years,by Sabrina M. '21,"January 27, 2025","I’m sitting in the quiet car of a Northeast Regional Amtrak train, writing a blog post for the first time in almost four years. Since I started MIT in the fall of 2015, I’ve taken the trip from New York to Boston more times than I can count, whether by car or bus or plane or train. My parents used to drive me down and back⁠01 when I first started college, 17 and still their innocent, perhaps helpless, teenaged child. The years after were filled with long, uncomfortable, sometimes melancholy, sometimes scary trips on the medley of NYC – Boston busses available: the Greyhound bus when I wanted to cut down the final one to three hours that driving into Manhattan added to commute time, the Lucky Star bus to Chinatown when I valued speed over all, the Megabus when I could catch it cheap enough, and any other bus when I was desperate and needed a way back now, with the kind of youthful urgency I could only have when every experience felt so new and every second felt like it would slip away from me, taking the rest of my life with it. For some holidays, my mom would find plane tickets cheap if she bought them almost a year in advance, and for the first time in my life, I learned to fly alone. I’d grip my seatbelt hard for the duration of the forty-minute flight, wishing I could ask the older women sitting next to me to hold my hand through my ever-worsening plane anxiety. We were going to go down as soon as we went up, I was sure of it, but I could only rely on myself to assuage the crushing fear of this knowing. Since the pandemic temporarily tanked Amtrak’s prices and I grew older,⁠02 I’ve taken to riding the train whenever I journey back. Its coastal views of the northeast are familiar to me, and its spotty Wi-Fi comforting. I don’t need to white knuckle my way through the slow, relaxed ride along the northeast coast.!#@p!#@I’m listening to a playlist I made in 2016 precisely for this reason: long trips between the two cities I would call home. Over the years I’ve slowly added songs to its seven hour plus runtime, and it is both an ode to the nostalgia of that first year of back and forth travel, but also a time capsule for the different points in my life to come after. There are songs that I’ve cherished since high school,⁠03 songs I discovered after graduating MIT,⁠04 and songs I once knew and then rediscovered and reimbued with new meaning as I grew older.⁠05 Right now, Sufjan Steven’s Chicago is playing through my headphones, and I’m hit with the memory of all these years gone by as quickly as the trees zoom past the train windows. I’m reflecting on almost ten years since I moved to Cambridge as Sufjan and his backing chorus chant that all things go, all things grow.!#@p!#@Despite the gulf of time between who I am today at 27, and who I was then at 17, I don’t feel as if I’ve wholly changed. I feel older, certainly, but not like a different person. For one, I am still living in Cambridge, a mere mile and a half away from where I first called home, in Inman Square as opposed to Kendall. I’m still a student, but not at MIT, and not for much longer. I’m still a hopeless romantic, a lover of art, a queer media enthusiast, an aspiring chef, a devoted concert attendee, and too online (although I have been consciously working on that). I still struggle with imposter syndrome, fear flying, and am prone to periods of derailing melancholy.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3792-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6760-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7474-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4473-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6843-800x600.jpg]!#@That’s not to say that my life has remained stagnant. Since graduating in 2021, I’ve been working on my Masters of Architecture down the river at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. In the last three, almost four years, I have had countless sleep deprived nights gluing pieces of models together, drawing floorplans, taking photographs, writing scripts, setting up presentations, finding perfect views, and commiserating with friends in the same boat as me. I’ve designed houses, monasteries, distilleries, community centers, theaters, churches, and a whole lot of things that can’t even truly be called architecture. I’ve logged so many hours onto Adobe’s Creative Suite. I’ve 3D printed probably a house’s worth of plastic⁠06 and built things I never thought I could. I finally learned how to code, despite resisting it stupidly during my time at MIT. Just this December, I presented my thesis on using queer theory to redesign religious spaces.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0021-800x1200.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9764-800x1200.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9843-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MG_9888-800x533.jpg]!#@I’ve learned a lot, not just about architecture but also about myself and what I want out of life. I’ve cried many times but laughed many more. I started taking anti-depressants, which I resisted for years at MIT, convinced that nothing but pure logical thinking could get my sadness to abate.⁠07 I now enjoy eating at Clover, something I (a bit unfairly) hated for a long time. I’ve grown out my hair and then shaved it all off. I got surgery that changed my life and my relationship with my body for the better. I performed in drag in front of hundreds of people for the first time ever, and then did it again a year later, and again. I’ve learned to be more okay with solitude, finding peace with going to concerts or movies or restaurants alone. I deleted much of my social media and started reading the news. Running, a hobby I picked up begrudgingly in 2020 when the gyms and world closed down, is now something I look forward to in my routine, and I regularly jog across bridges I once wrote about crossing, my heart beating faster and reminding me that I’m alive as I breathe in cold riverside air. I obsessively scroll through and post my deepest, most vulnerable thoughts on Strava to make up for my lack of other internet time sinks. I caught up with old classmates I hadn’t seen in years at the Mega Pi Reunion in Las Vegas. In the words of Sufjan,⁠08 I fell in love again,⁠09  with people, with things, with life.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GSDSFH_N1624-199-2-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5763-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6471-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/24e28ccb-a4c3-4945-b7ce-13b90519c47c.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8303-800x1067.jpg]!#@Even though I haven’t been far from MIT spatially, my life feels farther away from that time than a few miles can quantify. New buildings have cropped up around Cambridge and MIT. Places I’ve loved have closed or changed,⁠10 renovated to accommodate an ever-evolving city. Graduate school for architecture is starkly different from my undergraduate experience in engineering, and Harvard feels so far from MIT that it still shocks me three years later. Even when I cross register for classes, I don’t feel as if I quite belong anymore, as if I am an old friend that hasn’t yet realized we’ve outgrown a certain relationship. I wonder what my life would look like now had I stayed at MIT for graduate school. I am a person adapted to a new environment in ways I don’t even fully notice much of the time – wearing too much black, taking pictures of buildings I see on the street, laughing at jokes about Corbusier.!#@p!#@As I look for jobs now, I realize that my chapter in Cambridge might finally be coming to an end when I graduate in May. I’ve loved living here, loved spending time with friends I made in undergrad and meeting new friends in graduate school, loved getting to know how to navigate the city streets with ease, and loved the feeling of home I got when I stared down the bank of the Charles on my way to my apartment after a long trip. But, ten years feels like a long time to stay in one place while I’m still in my twenties. I feel the itch to explore something else for a time, even if a part of me knows I might still want to come back one day. The prospect of leaving is scary, even if it feels right. The entirety of my adulthood has unfolded in this city, but learning to let go (and to let grow) is a skill that getting older has forced me to learn.!#@p!#@It’s hard for me to envision a future where I’m not still here. Moreso than my first graduation from MIT, the end of one small chapter of my life, this time feels like the end of an entire part of my life’s novel, looming close by with its blank title page. The last few years, though filled with hardships of their own, have felt for the most part predictable: one semester led to another, and another, and everything was quite neatly laid out and planned for the duration of my time as a student. I would complete a year and continue to the next, comforted by the seemingly endless cycle of academia and the seasons it follows: fall, winter, spring, summer. When I graduate in May, there will be no semester to look forward to, no routine to fall back into. The next steps are a blur to me, even if I feel as if I have a steadier grip on the overall qualities I want out of them.⁠11!#@p!#@Even the version of me that might leave will still be the person I was. Time has molded me into something more refined, but I am still the person who loves this place. I still miss Senior Haus and the community I found at MIT. I can’t help the part of me that, whether on a walk with friends or with a first date, points towards the small stone building on Amherst and says I used to live there, excitedly, wistfully. I happily talk about my days in undergrad with the rose colored glasses so familiar to memory. I tear up thinking about all the people I’ve met and grown apart from here, not knowing what words I could say to bridge the gap between five years and five hundred miles. I long for the warm sun on my skin as I sit on the Felipe’s rooftop, or on the docks of the Esplanade, or in Killian or the design school backyard. I hold these experiences so close to my heart that they cannot be removed, softened and absorbed into the beating tissue.!#@p!#@But for now, I’m still here. I can’t finish my degree without a couple more classes, not that I am in any rush to leave sooner than I have to. As a final full circle moment, as a former MIT student and blogger, I hope to cross register for a writing class in my last semester. As a now outsider, getting into classes has become considerably harder (though I have taken a few since leaving), but I’m hoping that some of my last few months here can be spent walking down the halls where I started this whole journey.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3792-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6760-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7474-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4473-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6843-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0021-800x1200.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9764-800x1200.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9843-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MG_9888-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GSDSFH_N1624-199-2-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5763-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6471-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/24e28ccb-a4c3-4945-b7ce-13b90519c47c.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_8303-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/im-still-here-for-now/

'21,"January 27, 2025","helloooooooo blogosphere!!#@p!#@so i wasn’t planning on posting this week — the usual feelings of hosage, and what to write, and all of that. but reading everyone’s blogs has brought me so much joy, and i’m sitting here on a Sunday afternoon just being chronically online, and so i have decided to give myself exactly one (1) hour to write this blog. we are starting at 4:18 PM GMT, and we will see what is to come.!#@p!#@gmt. greenwich mean time. i’m in the united kingdom for the first time! i just came back from my first sunday roast with some grad school friends and collaborators, which was absolutely delicious and had far too much food but i will enjoy the leftovers for many meals this week.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250126_124213045-1000x753.jpg]!#@i’m here in Southampton on grad studenting business. it is still wild to me that i’m a grad student at MIT, that i’ve been around here for 8 years, that i only have 5 more semesters of mit and then i will never be a student again, that there is a world in which in 2.5 years i leave this place that i call home.!#@p!#@the grad school things are going. as said in many more words in other posts, i was never someone who was fully sold on grad school. there are times where grad school has been hard, because of so many reasons — mental health, trying to figure out what to work on, feeling like nothing i was working on was interesting or would make a difference in the world, things in my personal life. but i think in the last year, things have started to take a bit more of an upswing. i’ve met kids who are such nerds that were so happy to be a part of my research giving them more math materials. i’ve worked with entire cities’ school districts to help them figure out how to manage their school assignment process. heck, i’m in the UK right now looking at a whole country’s admissions data to analyze some policy questions. if i look back on senior year me, and the ways they were thinking about what grad school could be, these were the types of things i could only dream of doing them. and just like how whenever i bike to the department, i look across killian and up to the big dome, and think about how wild it is that i’m here at mit. in that same vein, there is this sense of awe at “wow, i cannot believe i’m actually doing this.”!#@p!#@mit. ten years.!#@p!#@at the end of this year, cambridge will be the longest i’ve lived in any one place. and honestly it does feel like it is home these days. nevada, where i am ostensibly from, was only really home for the people it had. and so many of those people are now scattered around the country. including right in Boston — one of my dearest and closest friends from HS lives just a 20-minute trek down the Orange line, just 8 minutes from the Green Street stop. and i’m there multiple times a month, and it is a joy to keep him in my life in this way. and now i’m friends with his partners, and friends of those partners, and also their cat beanie who is an adorable void cat with one brain cell, and we play DnD together across multiple campaigns (i am perhaps too proud of the Aussie and Irish accents i’ve been developing for wella and myrna, respectively). and i am very grateful to Boston and the people i’m around for being this community in my life. the high school friends who’ve known me forever, the grad school friends who commiserate about and share the joys of work, the old undergrad friends who get together and give each other snark and visit texas roadhouse once a year for valentine’s day our birthday mystery hunt.!#@p!#@and while i am someone who has been afraid of stagnation, and still am, it’s something that i’ve felt better about over time. part of that is because of this buildup of community — as someone who moved around a lot as a kid, boston is the first place where i’ve felt settled, where i know how to get around without needing to look up directions, where there are all of these people around me i care about and who care about me, where i feel so comfortable and so much like me.!#@p!#@but the other part of it, and perhaps more important, is recognizing that change will always happen. i think i didn’t use to always believe this. when a close friend asked me, a year or so out of undergrad, how much i’d changed in various eras of life, i said something about how i felt like most of my changing in life (~80%?) had happened to be in high school, the period of my life where i felt like i “became a person”. and maybe 15% had happened in college, and 5% afterward. and to paolo circa 2022, that was truly what i believed.!#@p!#@but i think 2022-me was biased to believe that because the ways that i changed in college were more subtle. yes, high school may have been where i came into a self for the first time. and the values of HS me may have been kept throughout college, and through until now, but the ways i’ve changed have been more about how i interpret those values, the ways i choose to live them out, the things that get done with them.!#@p!#@i started writing that sentence, only to remember halfway through that it’s exactly what my very first sentence on the blogs was.!#@p!#@funny how things come full circle. (time check: 4:47. aaaa.)!#@p!#@there are certainly many ways in which i do feel the same as senior year me, who started blogging 5 years ago during the height of COVID, though often they do play out in different ways. certainly i’m still a very musical person, though it’s now come more to the forefront through a cappella and musicals. i’m also certainly a creature of impulse, making very stupid jokes and enjoying the little things in life.!#@p!#@perhaps the biggest way that last bit comes out is in my GRAing. GRAs, or Graduate Resident Advisors, are grad students who live in undergrad dorms and run study breaks, help students when they need things, provide advice, and just generally be a presence. i like to describe it as “i am an adult if you need one”.!#@p!#@as previously mentioned on the blogs by Amber ’24, i’m the gra for burton 1 (go b1ners!!). it’s very fun to be the b1ner gra, and not just because several bloggers have passed through (Amber V. ’24, Gosha G. ’24, Allison E. ’27, Veronica P. ’27) (god there are SO many of y’all aren’t there). i do find a very, very deep personal joy in getting to feed the b1ners through finals breakfasts, and being there if someone needs to talk about stress or how life is going or etc. but of course, being me, i also find deep joy in it for running my very, very stupid study breaks, including:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20221221_021748699-800x602.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20240312_023612835-800x1063.jpg]!#@(if any b1ners are reading this, this is a secret SECRET announcement that my next study break is going to be T themed. as in, MBTA, tea i’m bringing back from Southampton. a giant T spoon that i made over the holidays. brought to you by the letter T. also lots of British snacks send me your requests :P)!#@p!#@(if you’re not a b1ner, you are not allowed to spill the beans to them. shh.)!#@p!#@(and if you are a b1ner. 💙💙💙 excited to see y’all again soon!)!#@p!#@so what are ways i feel like i’ve changed, ways that i didn’t appreciate before but recognize now, or new ways of change that have cropped up?!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250119_223332824-1000x750.jpg]!#@when i was in chicago over the summer, i grabbed coffee with a high school friend. (i actually hadn’t remembered she was in town until i arrived, and the friend i was staying with asked “so… are you planning to meet up with anyone else while you’re here?”) i hadn’t talked to her in almost 4 years, and there was a deep joy in getting to see her again.!#@p!#@it didn’t take long for the rust to fall off of our friendship, and soon we were giving each other snark and talking about all sorts of things in our lives. i’d forgotten that at some point in high school, between being co-TAs and sharing study halls, we decided that we were people who were allowed to just ask each other anything. one particularly interesting conversation topic that we got to was “what are ways that you think you’ve changed from high school for the worse?”!#@p!#@in some ways, this is a bit of the antithesis of the section above. it’s taking a careful look at yourself and pointing to some part of you and saying “i wish that you weren’t there, and you were the way you were 7 years ago”. and it’s because of this that it feels a bit like an unfair question. it is forcing one to make judgments about oneself, to explicitly assign parts of oneself a negative quality.!#@p!#@of course, that isn’t to say i don’t have an answer — i did. but i bring this all up not to share that answer, but rather to focus on the fact that the part of myself i am working on the most right now is that of self-judgment. of letting myself be the person that i am, and leaving it at that. of feeling like i can identify with who i am. a few years ago, i noted with my therapist that i often said phrases like “when X happens, my brain thinks Y…” or “my body feels Z”. on reflection, that’s a very impersonal way of seeing the world — in some ways, beyond brain in a jar, where instead i am just experiencing the thoughts and feelings through the lens of some third-party brain and body.!#@p!#@when i talk about agency, and self-understanding, i think this really is what i’m referring to: the idea that i can just be the person i am.!#@p!#@i’m a little over time, as it is now 5:24PM, but i’m giving myself a little leeway from adding photos and getting distracted showing some people some photos and one of the grad school friends coming through the kitchen to grab some coffee. we all need a little leeway sometimes, and deadlines often are just recommendations :) [note: this is not advice for your mit app. that one is not a recommendation.]!#@p!#@it’s been fun to see this post come out of absolutely nothing in the last hour, to watch it grow and flourish and become something. and it’s been fun reading everyone’s posts this week, seeing all the ways that the bloggers have changed from their undergrad days, and yet, are still unmistakably themmany years later.!#@p!#@wishing all of you the best, and excited to keep seeing the ways in which everyone grows :)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250126_124213045-1000x753.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20221221_021748699-800x602.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20240312_023612835-800x1063.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250119_223332824-1000x750.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/throughlines/
Living Meaningfully by Nisha D. '21,and all the things that has entailed,by Nisha D. '21,"January 26, 2025","I really was not going to post. There were several excuses I was making to myself as to why I was not going to post:!#@p!#@But then, all my friends started posting, and it was honestly so nice to see all the older bloglums give their updates that I decided to post too.!#@p!#@In real words: since leaving MIT, I have completely overhauled my life twice. The first was to move across the country to (less sunny than you’d think) San Francisco. It was part of an ongoing migration of most of my friends westward, some for grad school and some for work. Andrea M. ‘18 and I got an apartment just off 24th and Mission. My partner since freshman year of East Campus started his first year at Stanford. My childhood best friend moved a fifteen minute bike ride⁠01 away.!#@p!#@It took me a while to feel like I lived in California. For the first few months, I was flying back and forth to the East coast somewhat often, and felt like I was never actually in San Francisco for more than a few weeks at a time. I don’t know if I ever felt like I lived there until I decided to leave.!#@p!#@But by all heuristics, I did live there. I made new friends at the Twitch office, where I commuted almost every day for the free lunch, biked to the wholesale coop for groceries, and generally enjoyed the trappings of adult life, like having a tech salary and going to trivia and/or drinks after work. I spent some weekends in Palo Alto, marveling at the beauty of Stanford campus as I biked from the Caltrain station to Rains⁠02 ; my partner spent the rest in the city. My best friend and I had a resolution to go to a new bar and meet people every Wednesday evening, which we maybe did exactly once and spent the vast majority of Wednesdays at her apartment laughing at funny text posts and Final Fantasy 7 fan art on Pinterest. My couch featured a rotating cast of MIT friends. When it didn’t, Andrea and I used it to enjoy what we termed “pastoral evenings”, sewing patches onto our clothes and watching Sex and the City, Grey’s Anatomy, or Bojack Horseman while gorging on Meredith Farms goat cheese and the rosemary sourdough from Arizmendi.!#@p!#@Recounting this now, some part of me wonders: why did I ever leave? How did I ever leave the place with the largest proportion of my loved ones? When we graduate from MIT, we leave because we have to, not usually because we want to. I left San Francisco because I made the choice to.!#@p!#@One of the freedoms of having a 9-5 is that I could pick up hobbies in the meantime. I started fencing again, and used Twitch’s wellness fund to expense all of my gear. I learned how to snowboard. I went on long bike rides and appreciated how beautiful California really is. I traveled – at the end of 2022, I flew in a full circle around the world, stopping back home in Boston, my UROP mentor’s wedding in India, and getting lunch with a friend in Tokyo along the way. I got to take my partner around Japan for our five year anniversary, backpacking down a trail older than the country of America. The European summer trip finally happened.!#@p!#@On the surface, this is objectively a wonderful life – surrounded by friends, lots of hobbies, and a job that I liked decently well.!#@p!#@And yet, I suffered from what I can only describe as a weird sort of malaise. With an overabundance of free time, I would always find myself filling it with activities that were fun but not particularly fulfilling. My social battery seemed to always be on 0%; in the absence of tasks to do after work, most of it was spent hanging out with friends, which…should be fulfilling, right? But more often than not, I would reach the end of the week and rue all the social obligations I had signed myself up for. It was almost as if I had choice paralysis with how to spend my free time, and I would end most days unhappy about how I had spent it.!#@p!#@Many of the long time readers will know that I waffled back and forth about grad school many times on the blogs. In light of COVID (and post-MIT induced exhaustion), I had decided to not apply that year.!#@p!#@But mid-malaise, the lurking thought persisted. Should I let the act of working constantly take over my life again? I had tried very hard, through having a 9-5, to not let work be the thing that my life revolved around. Some of my friends can do this very well and set positive examples for what I could be like if I took a page from their book. I spent countless hours rolling the idea over in my head. A PhD was a lot of commitment, what if I just did a masters? But most masters are unfunded and not research based. Maybe I was just having a hard time adjusting to adulting; many of my older MIT friends tried to talk me down from the edge, so to speak. But then I would visit my partner at Stanford and imagine the life I could have there as a PhD student, and romanticize, because the grass is always greener on the other side.!#@p!#@A good friend of mine from work liked to quote the line “Know thyself” from Ted Lasso. Remember the European summer trip I mentioned? One of the stops on that trip was to a conference in Venice to present some research from my UROP that had finally got accepted. I had presented at a few conferences virtually over COVID, but this was my first time attending one in person. It was here that I had my “Know thyself” moment, working on the conference presentation with my UROP mentor at 3 am approximately 8 hours before I was supposed to be giving it. It was still working hours in San Francisco, and my manager called to tell me that my promotion had gone through, and that I effectively was now making twice of my (already very generous for a 23 year old) salary. And in that moment, I found that I…didn’t care, and that I was more excited to talk about this cool research project that I had done than I was about the fact that my total comp was $300k+. At the end of that trip, I asked my UROP mentor to write me a rec letter for grad school. She also told me to not apply, but she did write the letter.!#@p!#@I applied to 2*⁠03 PhD programs. Given PhD acceptance rates nowadays, this was ill-advised, but I had hubris, a reasonably strong publication record, and an unwillingness to leave the West coast. I had my sights set on Stanford – I could live with my partner in campus housing and not move far away from my friends. I dreamt about this existence so often that it became all-consuming. Tech layoffs were on the rise during my application season, and I was holding out for this vision of my life to manifest so that I wouldn’t have to worry about losing my job.!#@p!#@One thing that has become exceedingly clear to me as of late is that I’m pretty used to getting what I want in life. I dreamed of MIT since I was a kid, and got admitted early action. I wanted to work in the gaming industry, and I worked at PlayStation and Twitch. I wanted to do a UROP related to games, and I found the perfect one.!#@p!#@I did not get into Stanford.!#@p!#@I later learned, after nearly a week spent in bed crying, that they did not accept anybody in my subfield of computer science that year because all the spots had gone to AI people (classic)⁠04 . This did not make the rejection any less devastating. My dream was shattered, and I was left to wallow in its aftermath.!#@p!#@I did, however, get into the other school I applied to: the University of Washington. UW is in the top 3⁠05 biggest research hubs in human-computer interaction, and in undergrad, I had always toyed with the idea of applying there because I loved (and blogged extensively about) Seattle.!#@p!#@I was initially so heartbroken about not getting into Stanford – and the prospect of actually leaving the Bay Area was so terrifying – that I wasn’t even going to go to the admitted students weekend. But it was a free trip to Seattle, if nothing else. So I went, with absolutely no expectation that I would actually end up going.!#@p!#@But over the course of three days spent on UW’s beautiful campus (even though the weather was classically Seattle), my imagination went to work. And slowly, I could see it. I could see myself walking hurriedly across Red Square to get to class, maybe peeping Mount Rainier if she was out that day. I could see myself working on my own projects and ideas with a level of research freedom that I hadn’t been able to imagine as an undergrad. I could go to the coffee shops and poke places that I had frequented over the course of two summers in Seattle. I could see myself working and engaging with a community of like-minded researchers from all across the university, and getting to fully immerse myself in the field.!#@p!#@I could now see it, but the practicality of it was difficult. Even more of my friends were migrating to San Francisco. I didn’t have very many friends in Seattle, but the aforementioned work friend who likes Ted Lasso offered to move with me because he needed a change. I asked my partner if he would still love me if I moved to Seattle, and he said yes.!#@p!#@Something about this decision has always been inevitable. In the parking lot of a gas station in Truckee, California, en route back from my partner’s lab Tahoe trip, at the end of a harrowing week wherein Twitch laid off 20% of its staff, I accepted UW’s offer. A few months later, my partner and I crammed my new car – a Subaru Crosstrek⁠06 I bought off a friend – with all my belongings that didn’t go in the UHaul shipping boxes and we took a meandering drive up to Seattle for my new life to begin.!#@p!#@~~~!#@p!#@I am now a 2nd year PhD student. There have been ups and downs on this journey for sure. I had a wonderful first year, but am definitely crashing out a bit in my second. Before moving here, I don’t think I could have imagined myself owning a car, but I have grown into a version of myself who is capable of deciding to do an activity by myself and drive to it. Being long distance from my partner and most of my close friends is hard sometimes, but the short flights make it easy for us to see each other every 3-4 weeks. I have gotten rejected from more things in my first year in academia than I ever have in my life. My range of experienced emotions, which always seemed to be hovering somewhere within +/- 1 standard deviations of the mean in San Francisco, is now back to a more MIT-like +/- 3 standard deviations of the mean, which means that I sometimes feel more fulfilled than I ever have in my life and sometimes I am concerningly depressed.!#@p!#@I have less time to do things now. Most of it is spent on classes and research. But I fill the time I do have with the things that I really, really like doing. I fence three times a week, 2-3 hours every time, and have simultaneously improved and gotten worse at it. This is the first year that I’ve ever competed individually at fencing, and I have done terribly at every competition this year, despite improving technically. Fencing, it turns out, is mostly about mental fortitude under pressure, something which I find myself lacking in, even after 4 years of getting firehosed at MIT. But I know there’s a lesson somewhere in pushing through failure and showing up for something every day even if you’re doing bad at it.!#@p!#@I drive myself to snowboarding, sometimes on random weekdays if I feel so inclined. I live near the lake I really liked running around in the summer of 2020 and have run two Seattle half-marathons, with my eyes on the full. I’m 30 hours into Baldur’s Gate III, which I allow myself to play an hour of at the end of every day. I go to movies with my grad school pals. Limited time means that I’m forced to spend it in a way that I feel is meaningful. This includes grinding myself into the ground for my research, or crying over whatever failure is haunting me in the moment.!#@p!#@I purposely haven’t mentioned what I research until the very end of this post. The thing that I’ve realized about myself is that I need to have some sort of mission or quest that defines my life. Having a regular tech job is not conducive to this, but slaving day in and day out on your ideas is, even if you’re the only person who cares about your ideas.!#@p!#@A little over four years ago, in one of my last blog posts, I said:!#@p!#@This is it. I played that game⁠07 over half my lifetime ago now, but this mission has not changed: to show, to prove, to put my stake into the world that games are wonderful, educational, and can change lives for the better. The malaise that haunted me at Twitch was due to deviating a little too far from that mission. The thing that keeps me going through the slog of grad school is knowing that what I’m doing feels in service of that mission, even if nobody else cares about it. Even if the government is collapsing, even if its been raining for weeks, even if nothing in my life is actually going well, I know that I’m working on externalizing my most longstanding passion, and that makes things okay.!#@p!#@I research meaningful experiences in games. Some of the projects I’ve worked on in the last year include: misinformation education escape rooms, designing apps for people in long distance relationships who stay connected through games⁠08 , and a smattering of other projects related to games, education, and mental health. The project I’m working on right now is attempting to tackle the large task of modelling personally meaningful experiences in games and how they’ve tangibly affected peoples’ behaviors. Technology can be pretty horrible, but it can also be a positive force in peoples’ lives. I attribute a large part of being a functional and motivated human being to playing games, and I’m invested in more people having those sorts of experiences.!#@p!#@I’m writing this post on the same day that the NSF is literally getting nuked. As a researcher, I obviously have a lot of uncertainty about what that could mean for me. I’m crossing my fingers that I’ll be able to make it to the end of my degree with funding. I’ve surprised myself by having vague dreams of being a professor, something that I did NOT enter grad school even considering. For now, I’m hoping to just put my head down and keep working on the things that I enjoy, and crossing my fingers to land on my feet. This strategy has mostly been successful thus far.!#@p!#@This post has ended up being at least 3x as long as I expected it to be – posters instinct never dies, I guess. But I’ll leave it with another 4 year old quote from past Nisha:!#@p!#@It took some hard choices. But I’m glad to be able to report to past Nisha, and to all of you, that I can, in fact, continue to say that.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/living-meaningfully/
In which I am somehow still an MIT student by Alex M. '21,4 years later,by Alex M. '21,"January 26, 2025","In broad strokes, my life in 2025 is not so different from my life in 2021. I’m a student at MIT studying aerospace engineering. I live in Somerville with my wife, whom I have lived with since January 2021, and whom I have dated since October 2017.⁠01 And yet, in the last four years, I graduated from MIT, twice. I got engaged and then married. I got a dog. I moved, once, and now I’ve lived in the same apartment for 3.5 years, after moving 5 times in a single year. I won a big novelty check in a competition.⁠02 I had many hiking and rock climbing⁠03 adventures.!#@p!#@When I last wrote here in spring 2021, I was living off-campus in Winter Hill, and spent my time anxiously waiting to get vaccinated for COVID, doomscrolling, and trying to “make the most” of my last semester of college, despite not being on campus. I took four classes, and had one UROP, and hung out with my roommates and my girlfriend. 04 I knew I was going to graduate school, and I expected to complete my PhD in STAR Lab, and to work on satellite controls.!#@p!#@As spring 2021 bled into summer, I graduated online. I didn’t watch, but my parents did. I started in the AeroAstro PhD program at MIT on June 1, 2021.⁠05 I started grad school in STAR Lab, the same lab that I had UROP’ed in. That first year of grad school, I was funded to work on data validation for TROPICS, a weather satellite, and on efficiently co-locating data from different types of satellites. I also continued my UROP work on guidance, navigation, and control for BeaverCube, a student-built magnetically actuated satellite. I also worked on on-orbit cloud identification for small satellites, which eventually became my master’s thesis.⁠06 I also took classes. It was a very busy year.!#@p!#@In June 2022, my now-wife proposed while we were canoeing on Lake Washington on a very sunny day. I counter-proposed in August, at a picnic at a sculpture garden in Massachusetts. Even though we had already been engaged for months and she knew exactly what was happening, I was incredibly nervous — I wanted everything to be perfect. I kept waiting for a private moment, which never came because we were at a popular picnic spot on a sunny weekend day, so I eventually gave up and got down on one knee in front of a few random people. Even more embarrassingly, after hyping up the proposal for weeks, I forgot my entire speech. Luckily, she still said yes, and by the time we got married in 2024, my semi-botched proposal was just a sweet and funny memory.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/engagement-400x301.jpg]!#@My wife and I didn’t want to plan our wedding right away, so we decided to adopt a dog instead. 2023 is the year of the dog, we said; 2024 will be the year of the wedding. After using ChatGPT to write our landlord an email asking if we could get a dog and extensively discussing what potential problem behaviors we could and could not tolerate, I saw a dog on the internet with really big ears⁠07 and “mild gastrointestinal issues”⁠08 who needed a home. We named him Percy, which is short for Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover or for Perseus Jackson, depending on who you ask. Since April 2023, Percy has gone from severely underweight at 35 lb to healthy at 50 lb,⁠09 and has also transitioned from prescription dog food to normal dog food. He is a very friendly and playful dog who has been described as “difficult to harness and leash” (because he gets too excited) and as having a “lust for life”.⁠10 He loves food, going outside, eating random stuff off the sidewalk, playing fetch, and interrupting Zoom meetings.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_mbta-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_skinny-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_fells-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_lily_peanut_butter-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_lily_backseat-800x600.jpg]!#@I also switched research groups in 2023. After finishing my master’s thesis, I wanted to focus on controls and optimization for my PhD. I had actually been interested in controls since before starting grad school, and had even worked on satellite controls as an undergrad in STAR Lab. My advisor was also very supportive of me and was basically willing to let me research whatever I wanted. However, STAR Lab’s research focuses primarily on space optics and space systems, and I found it difficult to settle on a project and find collaborators. This wasn’t an issue with my previous UROP, because I had been working with Patrick, a senior grad student who shared my research interests. But Patrick was graduating soon,⁠11 and I wanted to start a new project focused on planetary entry, descent, and landing, but I didn’t feel equipped to work entirely on my own. I felt (and still feel) that it’s not possible to do substantive original research in a vacuum. Successful researchers collaborate, and try to produce work which fits into and is in conversation with the broader scientific literature.!#@p!#@So, even though I felt perfectly welcome in STAR Lab, I switched into the Aerospace Controls Lab (ACL) towards the end of 2023. Switching labs is hard and humbling and I’m glad that I did it. I felt like I knew as much as a first-year student, but as a third-year, I also felt pressure to publish and to have a clearly defined research vision. I spent most of my third year reading papers and taking extra classes to try to catch up. My PhD research focuses on uncertainty-aware guidance algorithms for aerocapture, which is a maneuver where a spacecraft plunges through the atmosphere of a planet to slow itself down, in order to successfully enter into an orbit around the planet. So, I read about aerocapture, and uncertainty-aware path planning, and for good measure, I read a lot of recent papers from ACL and related groups at other institutions, and I read the papers that those papers cited, and I read the papers that those papers cited. At one point, I spent a weekend in New Hampshire taking a self-rescue course for rock climbers, and I brought a stack of papers to read in my sleeping bag at night.⁠12!#@p!#@In addition to reading and taking controls classes, I also spent a lot of time developing my own aerocapture simulation and re-implementing different algorithms from the literature. I was very busy, but I was also not publishing. My new advisor suggested that I defend my thesis proposal by the end of the semester, which he defined as “the end of May”, so I scheduled my thesis proposal defense for May 31. I passed, officially turning me into an ABD grad student.⁠13 However, the dissertation is the hard part and the whole point of the PhD, so I still felt very far away from graduation. Also, I was getting married at the end of June, and I still didn’t have a tie, and hadn’t written my vows. Also, even though my PhD committee approved my thesis proposal, they had fairly different ideas about what I should do next. ⁠14 Also, I had to get on a cross-country flight six hours later to attend my brother’s high school graduation,⁠15 and I hadn’t packed.!#@p!#@Luckily, I made my flight, and I wrote my vows, and my wife bought me a tie while I was at my brother’s graduation. The last two weeks of June were a blur of wedding planning. We went to the florist, and designed table numbers, and got a cashier’s check to send to the caterer, and made a shopping list for our rehearsal dinner. We learned our venue did not allow open flames and redesigned our ceremony to use artificial flowers instead of candles. My wife, who is a program manager and has project management skills that I do not have and greatly admire, took the lead on planning, so somehow I only experienced a fraction of the work, but we were both busy. Suddenly, it was June 30 and we were driving to the venue. The sky threatened thunderstorms, but the weather held, and soon we were taking photos, and then walking down the aisle. It was the best day of my life. I love being in love, and I loved celebrating with a small group of family and friends. Our wedding was officiated by a friend, and other friends signed our ketubah as witnesses, helped set up, designed floral table arrangements, and DJ’ed the reception. It was really special to see our community come together for us.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024_KimAlexKatz_CouplePortraits_P_06-400x267.jpg]!#@After a brief mini-honeymoon in Providence, we returned to Somerville and I returned to my normal life, except with more name change paperwork.⁠16 I started working towards the first conference paper of my PhD, and climbed as much as I could. I was training for a trip to Goat Wall in Mazama, WA to climb Flyboys, an easy/moderate 18-pitch sport route, with my friend Collin. Towards the end of September, shortly after submitting my conference paper, we flew into Seattle, where I borrowed my dad’s SUV and some camping gear. Next, we drove to Bellingham, where Collin borrowed his friend’s SUV and some camping gear from his mom. Then, we drove in separate cars for about four hours on the very beautiful⁠17 and fairly remote⁠18 North Cascades Highway, communicating by Rocky Talkie.⁠19!#@p!#@After dropping off one of the cars at the top of Goat Wall,⁠20 we had a taste of the Wild West at BJ’s Branding Iron Saloon⁠21 in Twisp, WA, and set up camp in the dark. We woke up before sunrise, broke camp, and headed to the base of Goat Wall. It was cold, but the climbing was fun and surprisingly easy, and the rock quality was very good. Several hours and 14 pitches later, it started to rain. We felt ready to be done, but we were not done. Climbing 18 pitches is sort of like being an MIT student for 18 consecutive semesters.⁠22 We kept going. We topped out a little after 5 pm, after about ten hours of climbing, and the sun broke through the clouds, and it felt incredible.!#@p!#@The next day, we set out to Washington Pass⁠23 to summit Liberty Bell via the Beckey Route. We did not succeed. After two hours of hiking, including a spicy scramble up a class 4 gully,⁠24 we reached the base of the climb in an exposed notch between Liberty Bell and Concord Tower.⁠25 While waiting for another climbing party to start moving, we got very cold, and then we got cold feet. We slowly inched our way out of the gully, and the wind died down and the sun came out as we exited the gully onto a marked climber’s trail, ⁠26 and then continued downhill to a hiking trail to Blue Lake. We ditched our packs just off the trail and decided to check out Blue Lake. We talked about bringing a bothy bag on future alpine trips to protect against the cold, and we took photos. Then, we picked up our bags, hiked out, drove west for hours on the North Cascades Highway, and finally ate some well-deserved pizza.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/alex_flyboys-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/collin_flyboys-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6979-2-800x605.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blue_lake-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/josh_on_pierce-800x1067.jpg]!#@Now it’s January 2025. I’m participating in MITOC Winter School, and trying to extend the conference paper I submitted last fall into a journal paper, while also starting what will hopefully become the second contribution of my PhD. I also spend a lot of time playing video games⁠27 with and cooking with my wife. Yesterday, we took Percy to Middlesex Fells and he had a blast running around in the mud. The day before that, I hiked Liberty and Flume with MITOC and had a blast walking around in the snow. Tomorrow, I’ll take the T to MIT, and I’ll code and read and write and return some gear to the MITOC office. I don’t know where I’ll be in four years, but I like my life now, and for that I am very grateful.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/engagement-400x301.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_mbta-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_skinny-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_fells-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_lily_peanut_butter-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/percy_lily_backseat-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024_KimAlexKatz_CouplePortraits_P_06-400x267.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/alex_flyboys-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/collin_flyboys-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6979-2-800x605.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blue_lake-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/josh_on_pierce-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-which-i-am-somehow-still-an-mit-student/
The After by Kirsten L. '15,,by Kirsten L. '15,"January 26, 2025","In a couple months, I’ll be back in Cambridge after 10 years of taking those first steps through Lobby 7 as a prefrosh. The inevitable soul searching happening as I try and remember what has happened since then.

What is life like after MIT?!#@p!#@Same same and different.!#@p!#@I’m still an engineer, working in the machine that is Big Tech. My day to day involves a lot less work on psets, a lot more talking with people, and probably the same amount of time spent in CAD. I’m still hacking it out here in the world of product design, so thank you DPD for exposing me to my future career⚙️! I have been able to ship a few products that are out there in the real world, and the feeling of making something that gets used around the world never stops being 🤯.!#@p!#@My job has given me the opportunity to travel internationally, which then enabled fun leisure travel. I’ve been able to keep in touch with some of my friends who I met at the other Cambridge (RIP CME). Michael C. and I even travelled together to Tanzania for a safari- definitely a core memory.!#@p!#@I feel lucky to call San Francisco my home. My community here still skews heavily from my MIT ties- a very present reminder of the bonds that tie us back to a place that simultaneously felt like hell and heaven (Though nostalgia tends to skew things heavier to the latter). I see the drive and ambition we had as students directed to new goals and projects- like starting new companies or families. I’ve also been to 10 MIT weddings in the last 5 years from various college friends. I’ve loved getting to be a part of my friend’s next steps in lives, and those weekends make me realize how special and precious friendship is.

Every year, the same group of friends I met in Maseeh gathers on zoom for our annual Secret Santa exchange. We’ve done this every year since we were freshmen, and now look forward to sharing our annual updates!!#@p!#@A couple of months ago, I got married to my best friend- who I met at work and still get to work close to (but not too closely) every day. Funnily enough, he grew up 20 minutes away from where I lived in Georgia. Planning our wedding was the biggest, most rewarding project I’ve taken on since graduating. Balancing everyone’s constraints while holding our own vision was tough, but we were really proud of how everything turned out (for anyone planning a wedding, I promise it’s worth it). My bridesmaids were all 15s who live in SF, friends who continue to be an inspiration and support throughout my life.!#@p!#@Life progresses slower after MIT.!#@p!#@Less drinking from a firehose, and more figuring out how to find inspiration without the pressure of the firehose. The problems are bigger and more impactful (finding a job, navigating team changes, making a home), but getting to a solution follows the same process from school. I feel like the same person I did when I graduated, but more confident and less stressed about working through the things life throws my way. 

That’s been my life after MIT. Looking forward to being back there in June!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-after/
"Learning how to be a human being, not a human doing by Caroline M. '18","After 6 years of adulting post MIT, these are the things I value now",by Caroline M. '18,"January 26, 2025","When I graduated in 2018, I was talking to my partner about how lost I felt. Igniting civic engagement on campus and advocating for peer to peer mental health had been my purpose and identity. And after leaving – I felt like a balloon with it’s strings cut.!#@p!#@Adrift. Empty. Useless.!#@p!#@I didn’t know what to do with myself or what was important to me – faced with decisions like where to live and to work. I didn’t have values that could guide me – only an emptiness that needed to be filled by feeling useful. Productive.!#@p!#@Only after six years of losing and almost losing things I didn’t realize were important, do I now have things I won’t let go of. Things I cannot live without.!#@p!#@Only now, have I started to live as a human being and not a human doing.!#@p!#@I’m 18 and a freshman. I don’t have time to waste on video games, there are “better things to do with my time”. I’m proud of the fact that not a single game is downloaded on my phone or computer.!#@p!#@I’m 24 and sitting down and playing games is something I look forward to. After a long day, capturing Pokemon alongside nostalgic 8-bit music, listening to killer vaporwave beats from a murder mystery, and completing a quest with friends in Baldur’s Gate 3 fill my heart gauge with energy. I’ve learned that playing games (maybe not until 3am) isn’t something to feel guilty about when it brings me joy.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/smt3.webp]!#@I’m 19 and a sophomore. I’m crashing in Tokyo with a friend I made through inline skating. She’s almost 30 and lying in bed with a heating pack on her back after only a gentle 10 mile skate. I look away, embarrassed for her and think “I won’t be like that.” I’m proud of my “self-sufficiency” and carry everything I need for months of travel in just one backpack with my skates strapped on top.!#@p!#@I’m 25 and in a rice roll (cheongfun) restaurant in Toronto with a friend. It’s been an extraordinarily long day. Despite looking forward to this trip for years, I spent the day mentally managing my chronic ankle pain and tendonitis. At the art museum, I was sitting on a bench swapping my ankle brace for my aircast ankle boot – the sound of velcro echoes. In Chinatown, we walk at a snail pace. Guilt increases with every step as I know he wanted to walk around more of the city.!#@p!#@That evening, the relief of finally sitting down, the shame of my inability to do more, and the mental load of the pain push me over the edge. Big, fat, Spirited Away Chihiro tears fall onto my phone as I am stuck on an Uber screen, agonizing over whether I spend $20 to Uber home or take public transit (and walk more). He’s a great friend and says he’ll just cover the Uber and not to stress.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image.webp]!#@Many physical therapy and acupuncture appointments later.!#@p!#@I’m 28 and using a muscle roller on my IT band, psoas muscle, and back is now part of my nightly routine. I invest in acupuncture and massage appointments to help my muscles relax and not strain my tendons.!#@p!#@Like oiling a car or cleaning my skate bearings, I now understand that effort and care need to paid for something to function well. I no longer skip lunch, work long hours, and ignore my muscle pain, pretending sacrifice means I’m being hardcore and committed to my work. It’s just a sign of neglect.!#@p!#@I’m 20 and a junior. I inline skate to everywhere on campus, partly because I wake up at 8:55am to get to a 9am class. Every morning I sprint out the door and see if I can beat my previous commute time, arriving to class winded and sweaty. Adrenaline is my coach, my crutch, and my addiction. When friends wave in the hallway, I wave, but rarely stop – always on my way to somewhere. One day, a friend tells me, “Hanging out with you feels like a meeting sometimes”. I’m crushed to hear it, but when strap my skates up to meet someone else in 15 minutes, I know he’s right.!#@p!#@I’m 27 and am hospitalized after falling on my skates, causing internal bleeding to my spleen and liver. I had been rushing from an appointment to a work meeting and mentally distracted from work stress. The nurses ask sympathetically if I was in a car accident and warn that I may need surgery to remove my spleen permanently. A few days later, one of my friends picks me up from the hospital in a torrential rain that floods Memorial Drive.!#@p!#@Instead of taking time off to heal, I worry about a work project and try working from bed through debilitating nerve pain near the injured organs. My partner helps me get up to go to the bathroom and I eat fruit yogurt pouches for months.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/jinbe.webp]!#@Many stomach meds and ginger candies later.!#@p!#@I’m 28 and have learned to not skate while stressed and just take the bus, an uber, or walk. My calendar isn’t full of back to back meetings – there are 30 min or 1 hour spaces in between. My morning alarm is now 20 minutes before my first meeting, not 2 minutes. I want to live life centered, grounded, and in my body – not running from it.!#@p!#@I’m 21 and just graduated, starting a new job at a nonprofit. At the end of every work day, the only emotion I feel is guilt for not having done enough. Most days I never see the sun because by the time I finish, the sun has set. Some days I take a break and then work from 10p to past midnight until I feel like I’ve done enough. When my younger brother visits and wants to hang out, I squeeze him in here and there, feeling further behind on work. I never feel a sense of accomplishment regardless of how many slide decks I finish, reports I publish, programs I lead – it’s just never enough.!#@p!#@I’m 28 and last week finally achieved one of my long-time goals to be a photographer for a wedding. Hearing my friend, the bride, talk about how precious this one picture I took of her dad is will always stay with me. And I overcame my fear of long-exposure and took this rad picture of light up poi at the dance part.!#@p!#@I now spend more time with my friends, on photography and storytelling, and with my family. Despite working at a nonprofit, I’ve realized that mission fulfillment isn’t the only kind of fulfillment.!#@p!#@Making sure I’ve enough energy to have deep discussions about movies with friends and my partner, take photos of friends and make them feel seen, and savor the time I have with my parents, all make me look forward to waking up every morning.!#@p!#@I’m 22 and it’s been a year since I graduated. The Red Line rushes through the tunnel on the way out of Charles MGH. The familiar sensation makes me feel disappointed that I’m still in Boston, wondering if I should move to DC or NYC or SF like so many other friends. Or maybe even Japan.!#@p!#@I’m 26 and hosting a barbecue with friends in the area. We’re doing cumin lamb skewers, grilled corn, grilled bok choy, and cantonese roast pork. We’re just catching up as the food gets nice and toasty. As voices overlap and wash over me, gratitude catches on my tongue like a snowflake. I realize I could never have done this if I moved overseas to Japan or Germany.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/bbq-400x444.webp]!#@I’m 28 and have been in Boston for 10 years now including undergrad. My first photoshoots were with MIT friends in the Boston area. When I was bedridden from my accident, MIT friends came over to help cook the easiest to digest lentils. When I was isolated and lonely during COVID, I met up with MIT friends in parks to share food socially distanced.!#@p!#@I’m 24 and it’s peak COVID. Messages on my phone are unread for months, some years. Guilt wraps me like a force field, suffocating my best intentions. But next to guilt is also relief. It’s COVID so now I have an excuse for disappearing and not responding earlier! The “counter” has been reset so I can reach out to people without needing to explain that I’ve been depressed, lost, and overwhelmed. Except that… no messages materialize. Conversations continue unheard, in my head.!#@p!#@Many “sorry it’s been forever” later.!#@p!#@I’m 28 and shame no longer gets in the way of living life with my friends as it happens. After many sessions of therapy, my friends’ infinite patience, and the magic of discord communities, “friendshiping” happens everyday. High school best friends are now just best friends and we share our pulls from Pokemon TCG Pocket. I’m not always “catching up” with friends, because they already know what I’m up to from discord updates or informal voice calls. We can just enjoy each other’s company, watch an anime episode, or play Stardew Valley.!#@p!#@And in the roughest days of my dad’s cancer treatments, their hug emojis felt like real hugs. And when they’re having trouble waking up to get to work or going through a breakup of their partner of 6 years, I send hug emojis, stickers, and jinbesan their way too.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-400x514.png]!#@I’m 28 and I feel a deep peace that’s new to me. A peace that comes when I see my actions aligning with my values. The internal becoming external.!#@p!#@I no longer feel ashamed at the many ways I don’t live up to my values or at the supposed lack of external progress in my life. I don’t fixate on how I think I’ve squandered the resources and guidance given to me by mentors at MIT, wasting my potential.!#@p!#@Instead, these words from one of my mentors, Kim, is a compass I hold closely –
“Do what makes you content.”!#@p!#@I’m learning to build my life bit by bit and value the things that bring me joy.!#@p!#@I’m learning to smile without feeling guilty about it – valuing my own worthiness to deserve happiness untied to productivity.!#@p!#@I’m unlearning the expectations of productivity that carried me through MIT and high school.!#@p!#@I’m learning how to be a human being and not a human doing.!#@p!#@And when I do that, I know deep in my bones, that I am making the most of the life I’ve been given.

'18,"January 25, 2025","!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burning-2018-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-1000x563.jpg]!#@In Lee Chang-dong’s film Burning, there is a concept of a “Little Hunger” and a “Great Hunger”. The Little Hunger is the desire for the material, basic needs and beyond, where the Great Hunger is a deeper search for meaning and understanding in life. The film is oriented around this theme, demonstrated by the three main characters’ central drama. Who has the Great Hunger, and who has the Little Hunger? Does the Great Hunger dissolve when you think you have found the answer?!#@p!#@It’s a strange movie brimming with symbolism that leaves you unsettled when you finish it, and yet (for me at least) unable to stop thinking about it.!#@p!#@In reality I think we all have a little bit of both Hungers. On a practical level, we all have to feed our Little Hunger, which includes our literal hunger, to survive. But precisely because of that, we can let the Great Hunger disappear if we want; we can survive without it. I think I could describe the 7 years since I graduated (but especially the first 4 or so) as wishing my Great Hunger would disappear, since I was so frustrated to never find the answers. It distracted me from doing day-to-day work, since I felt like I was missing a central ‘why’. It distracted me from a straightforward career progression too–though I’m learning that there usually isn’t one anyway.!#@p!#@For this reason, it was refreshing to read a few posts from alumni who are now over 15 years from when they graduated. With 7 years post-grad, I’m still in the midst of figuring things out–trying to solve both Hungers, really. I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to write at first when Petey reached out for posts from blogger alumni. So I decided to use one of my tactics against writer’s block: pilfering through my “graveyard”, discarded posts or snippets that were never published. I had wanted to write for years about this transitional period, but couldn’t find the right words. Here’s a few words I did find:!#@p!#@When I graduated, I grasped the edges of my limitations–feeling like I couldn’t learn fast enough or work hard enough. After taking a role at a very early stage startup with frequent 14+ hour days and weekends, I knew I didn’t want that kind of schedule–which made entrepreneurship feel out of reach. But what would replace it? What was my dream, as an MIT graduate? Was I just too tired, at that point, to have one?!#@p!#@Part of what I’ve been struggling with alongside the Hungers is what I like to call “the Iron Man Problem” of MIT graduates (a problem that I have probably contributed to). The problem is that, as MIT’s reputation has grown in tandem with the technology industry, going from weird niche tech school à la Caltech⁠01 toward a national higher education symbol like Harvard, the expectation is that the students are somehow uniquely different and adept from every other engineer in the country, even compared to other engineers from the top 10 or 20 schools (being able to build Iron Man suits overnight, for example).!#@p!#@Harvard has its roots in the humanities, squishier subjects where it’s harder to immediately evaluate someone’s performance the way you can in, say, a coding interview. Increasingly, I feel the weight of the Iron Man expectation. Are you allowed to make mistakes if you’re an MIT graduate, when you received such a coveted position? Will you have to live the rest of your life proving you deserved it?!#@p!#@I think now more than ever, this is something that concerns the last 10 years of graduates, amplifying the imposter syndrome that many of us will have, especially those of us who were told even before MIT that we could never be scientists, engineers, or mathematicians. Even if I had attended a different school, I can never look to the world to tell me I deserve my education or my career. Slowly I have realized that, to muster up the titanium spine, the unbreakable backbone I will need to continue in this field is no easy feat. As a high school student, I thought that graduating college was the final frontier, when in reality, it’s just the beginning.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burning_wide-6a5922cb6a057f84b6e1cb9e34f2ef855d19105d-1000x562.jpeg]!#@I found myself haunted by this as I bounced around various Boston startups and robotics roles. Was any of it good enough–my job, my output? It didn’t feel newsworthy or polished, I wasn’t an entrepreneur myself or a startup executive (what an expectation to have at 25) or even simply working at a big tech company. Perhaps the Iron Man expectation was that a sufficiently well fed Little Hunger should quiet the Great one, that it would prove some kind of meaning, at least to other people.!#@p!#@I had a perfectly decent career progression, built a sturdy resume, and began to look toward the next chapter. But after a while I felt like I didn’t know anymore how to distinguish between the Great Hunger of intellectual curiosity and a kind of depraved, capitalistic hunger for status. I call it depraved, the Little Hunger, and yet, like the many MIT Africans before me and beside me, I supported relatives and projects back home with the salary that I earned, and I was immensely proud of that. The other feeling that comes from having coveted privileges is a sense of duty, a mandate to do good in the world, one which I channeled to the Muti water project as an undergrad, and now use on the alumni board of the MIT Africa Impact Fund.!#@p!#@The Great Hunger was the question of whether I had chosen the right path with engineering,⁠02 whether I could or should find meaning in work. The Little Hunger had ballooned unsustainably, saying that wealth or status would be the thing that made me feel whole, and practically, would allow me to give more, provide more. In hindsight, I would say I struggled to balance (or even identify) the two Hungers, to feel fulfilled in all the different pieces of my life. I found it somehow unacceptable to just be a normal person who uses different parts of their life to fulfill these things, or to even seem average.!#@p!#@Faced with all these questions (amplified to the nth degree by 2020) I did what any person who pursued academic achievement for four-fifths of their life does: apply to graduate school.!#@p!#@I write to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a few minutes from the Carnegie Mellon University campus, which I “deferred” a decade ago in favor of MIT. Guided by a gut feeling, I intentionally chose not to attend MIT for grad school, to see if a different environment and campus culture would coax something different out of me. In CMU I wanted a place where I hoped I could find academic and research redemption, where I could forge my titanium spine and emerge as the LinkedIn version of the Terminator (or something).!#@p!#@On paper, I achieved what I set out to do, getting grades and publishing papers, throwing them into the maw of my imposter syndrome. Yet the soft, human part of me persists, the Great Hunger, the emotions, my fear and empathy and love. The things that distract me from a robotic output of work.!#@p!#@So in my final semester at CMU, I am taking a course in art and ML (one that’s more art than machine learning) and a course in ethics and ML (that is heavy on the ethics). I am doing what I can to try feeding my Great Hunger. I am slogging through my job search, still not entirely certain where I’ll end up, but believing that I am capable and worthy, knowing I am so effective and credentialed that even if I just want a career to feed the Little Hunger, I will certainly obtain one. I am aware that this is a unique privilege, and I try to be quick to support others however I can.!#@p!#@In-between all that, I watch films and shows, procrastinate, do yoga, plan trips. I sleep, even if I’m staring down a deadline or haven’t been “productive enough” that day. I spend time with friends and family. I treasure the visits and calls with my long-distance fiancé, Victor S. ‘21. I try to cherish all the life that happens in the in-between, whether mundane or extraordinary.!#@p!#@And I try to respect my inner beasts, rather than fight them.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burning-2018-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-1000x563.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burning_wide-6a5922cb6a057f84b6e1cb9e34f2ef855d19105d-1000x562.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-great-hunger/
Liminal Activities Period by Joel G. '18,IAP is a mindset and you can keep it forever,by Joel G. '18,"January 25, 2025","It’s been over six years since I graduated MIT – longer than I spent in school, but not long enough that my body has totally disconnected from the calendar. Fall still feels like the start of the school year, full of promise and mystery and challenges that I’m not prepared for but will somehow survive anyway. Summer feels like being momentarily ejected from the bubble to glimpse the wider world and plot real moves. And January, of course, is IAP.!#@p!#@“Independent Activities Period” is a deceptively bland name for what is in my opinion MIT’s greatest invention. It is the spiritual opposite of summer – instead of escaping, it’s about relaxing deeper into the bubble than ever, into a special world only accessible in the liminal space between semesters.!#@p!#@I remember starting every IAP in the exact same way. Back from the holidays, still burnt out from the fall semester, barely able to believe that I passed and do not in fact have an interminable cloud of work hanging over me, I’d collapse: flop on the couch in Zeta Psi common room, wallow in exhaustion, binge three movies a day.!#@p!#@I remember wondering how long it could last. If the next semester never started, would I ever get up off the couch? I despaired at the possibility that I lacked the intrinsic motivation that drives people toward self-actualization or whatever. Shouldn’t I be pursuing my interests? Learning new things? I saw wallowing as my ‘revealed preference’, each passing day sealing my indictment as a hopelessly lazy person. As often pointed out on the blogs, MIT culture can make you feel really guilty for not constantly tooling.!#@p!#@To my amazement, the wallowing never lasted forever. It didn’t suddenly stop one magical morning like an allergy medication advertisement. And it’s not like it would start to reverse, drawing me back into frantic finals-week grindset. Instead, every year, the exhaustion would unfold into a weird, timeless, dreamy freedom. I’d start clicking links instead of just scrolling, following rabbit holes deeper and deeper. When you’re lying on the couch you conserve energy, which lets your imagination run wilder than normal: could I bulk order this from Alibaba? could I make that with materials I have here in the house? Dumb ideas start sounding interesting and you start taking jokes too literally.!#@p!#@One year, my friend Kevin Kwok and I got a batch of custom frisbees printed with an obscure programming language inside-joke. Scheme, a language invented at MIT by Gerry Sussman and Guy Steele, was first described in a famous series of papers collectively called the “lambda papers” since they were all titled “Lambda: the Ultimate ___” (Lambda: the Ultimate Imperative, Lambda: the Ultimate GOTO, etc). We printed the MIT Scheme logo, featuring the infamous Y combinator, on top to make “Lambda: the Ultimate Frisbee”.!#@p!#@Is it art? A joke? Is it even funny? Hard to tell. But now we had 100 frisbees to give away.!#@p!#@After I graduated, I knew that it would be easy to lose the magic, and I was determined to keep it alive. It’s not just about “carving out time for personal projects”. It’s mostly about re-creating a paratelic mindset. It starts by lying on the couch and disconnecting from everything – every incentive, every career goal, the itch of jealousy, the field of status games. After all that drifts away, what do you start daydreaming about?!#@p!#@Last winter I started playing around with edge-lit acrylic panels. Acrylic is cheap and you can laser-cut it into any shapes you want, and if you put LED strips around the edge (pointing inwards) and take a sander both sides, you get an amazing diffuse glow from the whole piece. I liked this a lot because I always hated the harsh glare of LED strips when seen directly. But this was soft and warm!!#@p!#@At first I tried to make a sort of 3d “flower” of acrylic panel petals, but this was a disaster since they were fairly heavy and I didn’t know how to secure them in a rigid arrangement. So instead I thought I’d try tiling the 2d plane. I wanted something that looked more organic than symmetric or pixelated. Eventually I found a Voronoi component in Grasshopper, a visual programming environment for parametric modeling that comes with Rhino.!#@p!#@I played around until I found a satisfying shape, exported the design, and got it laser cut at NYC Resistor, a makerspace here in Brooklyn.!#@p!#@Edging each panel with LED strips was time-consuming. But spending unreasonable amounts of time on something is a classic IAP move. In IAP mindset, nothing is a waste of time.!#@p!#@Even after I finished, I still wasn’t sure what to call it. What had I just made? It didn’t matter; it looked great and I was proud of it.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/liminal-activities-period/
"6.5 Years Post-Graduation, I’m a Beading Artist by Yuliya K. '18",a twisty path,by Yuliya K. '18,"January 25, 2025","About 6.5 years ago, I graduated with a Philosophy degree and a minor in Political Science.!#@p!#@Two and a half years ago, after graduating again from Northwestern University’s science and health journalism program, I returned to the blogs to let people know: “I did not graduate from MIT on time due to mental health issues, but I’m thriving, and I’m a health journalist.”!#@p!#@Today, another twist: It wasn’t a mental health issue, and I’m no longer a writer—I’m a beading artist.!#@p!#@That may sound like fundamentally straying from the path set up by my education, but it was meant to be. I’m going to explain and sprinkle some of my artworks throughout—here’s piece #1.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YK_HokusaiGreatWave-1000x750.jpg]!#@A quick recap of what I did between graduating and becoming a full-time artist (in the most non-linear path I could find on Canva):!#@p!#@Somewhere in there, I also discovered that, good news, I wasn’t sleeping through 90% of my college classes because of a vague mood disorder. Bad news: The culprit was (and is) a rare and under-researched sleep disorder. And yes, a chronic incurable diagnosis is terrifying to discover. But what a relief to know that, with the right medication—if only I got referred to the right specialist—I could’ve woken up for 100% of my classes! Imagine thinking for years that it’s all in your head… And overnight, you learn that it’s “sleep inertia” and actually you can wake up so easily if you have those meds.!#@p!#@I could insert a million-word rant about the U.S. healthcare system here: From the way fat patients (like me) get denied appropriate care to how few answers providers actually have—and how much their lives are complicated by zealously money-saving insurance companies… But instead: art!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Klochan_Y_5_2024-1000x750.jpg]!#@So what now? Well, the one medication FDA-approved for my sleep disorder didn’t magically fix everything. In the fall of 2023, I quit my senior management position—the one I thought was the peak of corporate American dreams. In the fall of 2024, no longer able to produce thoroughly researched medical articles, I stopped health writing too.!#@p!#@What I could still produce, though, was art. And I loved it! In the midst of so much leaving my list of accessible opportunities, I had something that brought me joy, hope, and peace.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Klochan_Y_6_2024-1000x750.jpg]!#@For months before I quit my writing job, I’d been sharing my work with the world: through local artisan stores, galleries, art shows, and artisan markets—spaces I revered from a distance until mid-2024. Now I’m part of them!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241130_123721-scaled-e1737136111651-1000x990.jpg]!#@Beading in particular is how I honor my Ukrainian origins, but the patterns are often inspired by my current home, Chicago. I specialize in loom beading, sourcing often-rare top-quality seed beads—woven together with fishing line. The beads come in iridescent, metallic, matte, and luster finishes. About 2,000 of them per piece create a beautiful gleam.!#@p!#@By now, I see city scenes and artworks in bead colors. When the combination feels right, I make the beading pattern a reality.!#@p!#@And the rest of the time? I’m still living with the love of my life, and every day I get to look out at the beautiful Chicago skyline, including the Sears Tower, from our apartment. In the last half year, we got two best cats and a car (which we’d learned to drive just a month before).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3164-scaled-e1737136347555-1000x679.jpg]!#@Living with chronic illness sucks, and I can’t wait for the new medication approvals I was promised. But if I didn’t have a disability, perhaps being a senior manager would remain at the peak of my dreams. I would’ve missed out on the amazingly welcoming Chicago artist and disabled communities. I would’ve never felt the thrill of someone connecting with my art—that one piece I put hours into, carefully selecting thousands of tiny, sometimes uneven beads with a 5-inch needle.!#@p!#@In February, I’ll be joining my first art gallery exhibit.

Memories by Latasha Boyd,"I know this feelin', yes I know it very well (Thutmose)",by Latasha Boyd,"January 25, 2025","Hi everyone! I am excited to be back celebrating this milestone with you all. When I left MIT in 2018, I “graduated” with the first class I helped admit. It felt poetic, in a way. I embarked on a new career as a college counselor to give the same advice I loved to give on the blogs. Each of my students heard about finding their puzzle piece and the magic they will bring to any college they choose to attend. However, the more I acclimated to my new community, the louder the whispers in my head became:!#@p!#@“Don’t you think it’s time to leave MIT behind?”!#@p!#@A question I know many blog readers have also struggled with. Do you stop visiting the website at the end of your college application journey? What’s the point of sticking around?!#@p!#@My office still has admitted student art from CPWs past on the walls, and a picture of the quad near room 3-108 rested against a window. I predicted with my students when decisions would be released. In the time I have been away, I have still connected with the best admissions team in the world who have become some of my closest friends.!#@p!#@Last spring, I vocalized the whisper to my friends and was met with blank looks. My sense of sacrifice in the name of professional maturity was dismissed. It turned out I was still welcome, and the fence I had been building was unnecessary. My time at MIT was not just a phase, but a foundational thread in my journey that lead me to reflect on my impact in the world and how I love to engage and support students. Just as your time here has helped you reflect on your desires for a campus community that can feel like home as much as the blogs have. I hope that whatever your relationship with MIT has been, that we all are able to maintain our curiosity of the world, sense of adventure, and thirst for knowledge that we nurtured (and can still find) in these pages.!#@p!#@Now that I have seen so many more college campuses (and encourage the wisdom of a balanced college list), I share the magic of Denver sunsets, central Pennsylvania plasma labs, and arctic studies in Maine along with the magic that MIT shared with me.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/memories/
Repilot by Ceri R. '16,A 10th vlogiversary for the 20th blogiversary,by Ceri R. '16,"January 24, 2025","When we first decided to coordinate 20th anniversary blog posts, I thought I would largely contribute in a behind-the-scenes way, as I do with many projects in my life. While MIT students have IAP in January and take a breather from classes, Admissions Officers are in our seemingly never-ending busy season of reading applications! So it’s not like I don’t have a lot of other work to do right now.!#@p!#@But as I’ve been chatting with former bloggers, queuing their posts, and absorbing their stories, I got the itch to write. And when Celena C ’12 said that she was going to vlog, I got the even stronger itch to make a video.!#@p!#@So, last night, I scrambled to film and edit a vlog for—I think—the first time since undergrad. Special thanks to the one (1) soda I drank with dinner⁠01 that powered me through editing, particularly because I was ambitious and filmed B-roll when I came into the office last week, and I didn’t want those clips to go to waste.!#@p!#@In many ways, I have become much more practiced in talking through my thoughts and feelings on the fly (and on mic) in the past decade,⁠02 so I’m grateful to have impulsively created a time capsule at this point in my post-yet-kind-of-not-post-MIT journey.!#@p!#@Also, as I captioned and uploaded this vlog, I realized there was one key thing that I forgot to mention in all my monologuing: working with current (and past) bloggers is, by far, my favorite part of my current job. Many of my closest friends from my MIT days⁠03 are tied to these blogs in some way, even if we didn’t actually hang out at all when we were students. This is a very special internet community, and I hope you’re enjoying this reunion even a fraction as much as we are.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/repilot/
Three patterns from the pattern language of my life by Natasha B. '16,,by Natasha B. '16,"January 24, 2025","Hello! It’s about 3,000 days since I graduated from MIT, and three weeks since an even more significant phase change of life, involving a newborn.!#@p!#@In the 3,000 days, I moved to Washington, D.C. (for a fellowship writing for CityLab, then part of The Atlantic), moved to New Mexico to be near my family, worked as an architectural researcher and urban planner for five years, reconnected with a friend I met on the first day of CPW and married him, and moved across the Atlantic to the other Cambridge to research city-scale planning for shallow geothermal energy and ground source heat pumps.!#@p!#@In the three weeks, I have mostly just snuggled and fed and changed my baby, grabbed scraps of sleep when possible, and eaten the nice food people have brought to me. Life with a small baby is rich in patterns and scant on plans. A pattern, in the canonical architecture and planning guidebook A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein,!#@p!#@The problems: hunger, discomfort, an onslaught of stimulation from the world outside the womb. The solutions: milk, a change, patting, rocking, sleep. Solutions given or applied a million times over, never exactly the same way twice.!#@p!#@Because 3,000 days is a much longer time than three weeks, with a greater variety of patterns, problems, solutions, and events, I’ll account for the eight-plus years since I last blogged in a format inspired by A Pattern Language. A Pattern Language presents all elements or patterns, whether “sacred sites,” “pools and streams,” or “nine percent parking,” in roughly the same format. Each is laid out in this way:!#@p!#@“First, there is a picture, which shows an archetypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture, each pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets the context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps to complete certain larger patterns.” Then three diamonds marking the beginning of the problem; after the diamonds a headline, in bold type; then the body of the problem, including “the empirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its validity, the range of different ways the pattern can be manifested in a building,” and then the solution: “the heart of the pattern–which describes the field of physical and social relationship which are required to solve the stated problem, in the stated context.” The solution is given in the form of an instruction, and often accompanied by a pleasing little squiggly diagram or two. Each pattern chapter concludes with a paragraph outlining its links to the smaller patterns in the language, just as it began with a paragraph linking it to the larger patterns earlier in the book.!#@p!#@So here are some patterns excerpted from the unwritten idiosyncratic commonplace book of my own last decade. Remember, this is personal and made up! The “solutions” are written as instructions addressed to me, not to the world at large as they are in the real book. If you don’t relate, you can make your own imaginary book, your own preliminary pattern language.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/courtyard-MIT-graduation-1-800x1000.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/courtyard-wedding-800x1200.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/courtyard-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/leck-800x533.jpg]!#@…within a site containing one or more BUILDINGS (11), a courtyard may provide a kind of OUTDOOR ROOM (163) that is both private and shared. The courtyard may act as a CEREMONIAL SITE (171) or a LEISURE SPACE (183) for picnicking or sunbathing. In exceptionally good weather, the kinds of activities that normally take place indoors may relocate to the courtyard.!#@p!#@❖ ❖ ❖!#@p!#@An outdoor space that is open to the sky but enclosed on the sides can be lifeless and blank, or it can be the liveliest part of a site–it depends who is there, where their paths cross through it, and how the ceremony is done.!#@p!#@I graduated in Killian Court in 2016. I don’t remember walking across the stage, but I remember holding up my diploma and smiling while my mother took a photo, opening the diploma book when my sister said “show the diploma!” and looking on in horror five seconds later as a big splotch of bird poop landed on the creamy white cardstock near my name. I remember this because the green splotch is still there, and also because the whole sequence was photographed. Nature keeps me humble.!#@p!#@There’s also a photograph from that day of me and Justin together, which his mother must have taken. We were good friends throughout college (here he is in my blog post from 2014), but hadn’t seen each other much senior year, when we both lived off campus in opposite directions. After graduation, we fell out of touch for a few years until one day he messaged me, and on a whim I invited him to visit me in New Mexico, and he came. That was that, pretty much. Eleven months later we got married in a courtyard of the house my family was living in at the time. Extremely fun. My friend Eden wrote this song as a gift in honor of the day. That courtyard, in a house where some stranger lives now, was the most beautiful one I’ve been in. Sun-baked stucco walls enclosed a rectangle, with heavy wooden doors in the northwest and southeast corners. On the northern wall was a mural that might have been ninety years old, like the house. In the center were a small green octagonal pool with a bubbling fountain and a heavy-limbed apricot tree. Yellow roses bordered the edge of the courtyard by the house, and at the opposite end, a few steps rose up to a small sort of stage, where we had the ceremony. The only bad thing about the courtyard was a stupid little novelty plaque on the far wall that said “on this site in 1897 nothing happened,” which is obviously untrue. Things are always happening.!#@p!#@After the wedding, we moved to Albuquerque, to a funny house shaped like a ‘U.’ The bowl of the U made a kind of informal courtyard, surrounded by the white sides of the house and by the crumbling adobe brick wall that separated us from the gravel road. We set up an outdoor dining table and a pottery wheel in the shade of big elm trees, and when it wasn’t too blistering hot or freezing cold (Albuquerque is a land of extremes) we spent days out there, and sat around with friends in the afternoon.!#@p!#@Cambridge, England, where I am now, is full of courtyards. I have never been in a city with more courtyards per capita, or more grass tennis courts. I’m not saying it’s an efficient use of space, especially considering that many of them are off limits to foot traffic, and are only there to provide a green and well groomed carpet for the empty air above them. I do love the tennis, though. Being a PhD student after years of working and living outside academia is a little like stepping off a public street into a quiet courtyard. The institution around me provides some insulation from the commercial and professional pressures outside, giving me time and space to think hard and slowly and undertake deeper research than I could when I was working a regular job. I want to make the most of it. I’m also aware there is some loss inherent to being too cloistered, and some risk involved in loitering too long in a courtyard, without walking into the buildings around you, or venturing out into the next wider open space. Courtyards are meant to be crossed.!#@p!#@The entry on courtyards in A Pattern Language is titled not just ‘Courtyards,’ but ‘Courtyards Which Live.” A courtyard can be a perfect gathering place for celebration, or airy room for special pieces of communal life, but to be really alive it must be connected, opening onto a larger area and linked with the intimacy and comfort of the interior spaces adjacent to it.!#@p!#@Therefore:!#@p!#@If you are in a courtyard, physical or metaphorical, be alive. Pay attention to the people there with you, and keep continuity with the larger world and the interior spaces around you.!#@p!#@If you’re lucky enough to have access to a small, pretty courtyard at home or nearby, sit out there and have your coffee as often as possible, and try to keep the plants alive if they’re your responsibility.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chickenladder-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cocoon-garden-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/doona-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mari-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cocoon_blanket-800x1067.jpg]!#@…this pattern provides a respite from the larger patterns of FORWARD MOTION (12) and PUBLIC LIFE (3), nests within SEASONAL FLUCTUATION (17) and HOME (20), and relates to RESTING PLACES (31) and MAINTENANCE (14). Periods of life spent in the COCOON pattern are defined by retreat from outward-facing activities and external achievement and reward, and may be marked by partial employment, introspection, and the absence of frenzy. A good COCOON may not look or feel generative at the time one is in it, but provides a supportive environment for recovery and transformation.!#@p!#@❖ ❖ ❖!#@p!#@At times, it can be helpful to withdraw from regular activity, adopt a slower pace or even step backward, and cocoon.!#@p!#@In 2020, I had a frustrating, stagnating job and family chaos was burning me out. Meanwhile, the pandemic. My husband I moved to Albuquerque and nested hard–planted beans, peppers, and tomatoes, set up eleven chickens in the squat straw-bale coop in the backyard, and rapidly collected an overabundance of Craigslist furniture (later, we saw sense and pared it down). Two of my best friends came to live with us the summer of 2020, and in that period of pre-vaccine uncertainty and social distance, we were lucky to have a house that was lively and safe. When fall came, I quit the job, intending to take a new job I had been offered, but when it came time to commit, I had a strong feeling that the new job was not in fact what I wanted. I took some time to figure out what to do next. I had about a year of underemployment, intermittent freelance projects, spiraling, unspiraling, and planning. I applied to grad programs and started working at a landscape architecture and planning firm I really liked. The year felt long, and I was unsure and sometimes afraid, but in retrospect, it was in some ways a golden time, a rare extended pause. Our house was full of light and barely insulated. For the winter, my husband sewed me a literal cocoon in the form of a housecoat made out of a duvet.!#@p!#@The slowdown came to an end as my work ramped up and we prepared for the transatlantic move. Our lives since 2022 have been the opposite of contained. The geographic spread, the juggling of my research and writing jobs and Justin’s work and work travel, and the decision to have a baby now rather than waiting have contributed to a welcome level of complexity that is also sometimes difficult. But now, right now, I’m in another little cocoon. My focus on my baby and meeting her needs blurs out everything around us most of the time. I am typing with my right hand only, because my left arm is holding a warm, soft, sleeping weight.!#@p!#@This won’t last too long, and I believe that ultimately raising a child will expand my life and connections to the world, not contract them. Cocoons are designed to be temporary structures. Two quotes stuck in my head during my pregnancy. One is from James Baldwin, from the potent and historically resonant essay “Notes on the House of Bondage.”!#@p!#@The other is from the narrator of the novel Season of Migration to the North by Tayeb Salih.!#@p!#@Therefore:!#@p!#@Appreciate the cocoon while you’re in it. The road is wide and long, you’re still near the beginning, your child is at the very very beginning and will exist beyond you into an unfamiliar future. Her world is in its infancy. Our world as a whole is characterized by unremitting change, steady undercurrents and rapids driving movement beneath the surface, and breaks are necessary. To take a break, or make a good cocoon, hunker down in a place as simple and secure as you can find and turn your attention inward. Limit striving, or restrict its range to a single area. Be easy. Make the walls of the cocoon soft and flexible, not too strong. It’s just a seasonal dwelling.!#@p!#@❖ ❖ ❖!#@p!#@Periods of cocooning are supported by NAP TIME (91), COFFEE AND TEA (100). Immersion in public or personal LIBRARIES (46) may enrich the quality of time spent in the cocoon. SITES SUITABLE FOR SCHEMING AND DAYDREAMING (66) should be identified and fully utilized.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/reading-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/shelves-800x533.jpg]!#@…this pattern fulfills the blogger’s need to write and publish. It relates to the larger patterns of LEARNING (7), PUBLIC LIFE (3), and PLACES FOR CONVERSATION (18).!#@p!#@❖ ❖ ❖!#@p!#@I need to write.!#@p!#@You can take the girl out of MIT, but you can’t take the admissions blogger out of the girl. I’m no longer sitting at a booth in Steam Café at the top of Building 7 filling up notebooks in between classes (and have learned from yesterday’s alum blog posts that Steam no longer exists?), but I’m still a scribbler.!#@p!#@I’m a frequent guest author for the wonderful newsletter Scope of Work. Scope of Work is broadly a platform for writing about the physical world, and a community of people interested in and working in engineering, manufacturing, and infrastructure. My most recent installment, one of my favorites, was about soda ash, the Solvay Process, and the history of glassmaking.!#@p!#@Before I started writing for Scope of Work, I had a newsletter about buildings, materials, land use, and climate change called Buildingshed. I wrote about stone construction and the architecture in The Age of Innocence, Adrienne Rich’s “Powers of Recuperation” and Mariame Kamara’s work in Niger, and my part-adobe house. Eventually, I let the project lapse, but I have vague and occasional plans to revive it in some way, so if you’re interested, you can subscribe and you may get an email someday.!#@p!#@We’re in newsletter boom times, which is great, but I also miss old-fashioned blogs like these.

Mystery Hunt mile markers by Danny B.D. '15,portrait of the blogger as a young puzzler,by Danny B.D. '15,"January 24, 2025","Not only the blogs’ birthday—in trying to decide what to write, I discovered one of my old draft blog posts turned 10. Ten years ago, almost to the day, I was trying to figure out how to tell folks on here what the MIT Mystery Hunt was, and what it was like. Since the youth yearn for the mines content, here’s everything I have from then:!#@p!#@And that’s where I stopped my draft, mid-sentence. Thank you, me-from-2015.!#@p!#@Let me try that again.!#@p!#@Once a year, thousands of people (MIT-affiliated and not!) descend onto MIT’s campus over the long MLK weekend each January, and begin bashing their collective skulls against puzzles of any and all forms. This is the MIT Mystery Hunt: an annual event which changes in shape and size every year, in part because it’s always written by the team which finishes first the prior year: a combination honor/curse which means we’ll never see the same theme or hunt twice. It’s a time of seeing friends, and learning esoterica, and putting arcane things in spreadsheets, and not sleeping very much. There are other puzzle hunts (in-person and online) scattered throughout the year, but the MIT Mystery Hunt sits atop the calendar at just a whole other scale.!#@p!#@Hunt’s been covered on the blogs many, many, many times before, and also just got a lovely writeup in Technology Review. When I started that draft, though, I didn’t have a grasp of how important Hunt would be in my life. 2015 was my third hunt: my first year we actually won, so my second year we wrote (I helped with runtime stuff), and that third year, with that blog post draft, was only the second time I’d ever been an actual participant.!#@p!#@Fast forward a decade: our team continues to chug along, picking up current undergrads, recent alumni, various friends nearby and across the globe. We have members with graduation years predating other members’ birth years. I slowly learned more about how puzzles work and how to solve them—as of yet, despite having a few ideas (and despite having been on the writing team in 2014), I still haven’t taken a crack at writing any of my own. I’ve stuck with this team through increasingly unhinged team names, became one of the core people running our tech stack for puzzle management, and gotten a gnarly scar on my leg which could be a shark bite but is really just because I pulled an all-nighter in 2017 and then collided with a stone bench on the final runaround.!#@p!#@When I lived in San Francisco for 6 years, Hunt was the temporal landmark which anchored at least one of my trips back to see friends in the Boston area. It was one of those visits, feeling a wind-chill-in-the-teens January evening, which made me realize I really needed to move back: if I could miss New England in those conditions, I wasn’t just coating the climate with nostalgia. I did move back, and now I’m delighted that I get to now help shelter other friends who make an annual pilgrimage for this silly, silly weekend.!#@p!#@I started seeing someone new in early January 2022, and a week or two later I had to explain that I was going to vanish all weekend into this weird “hunt” thing. She was very understanding—but she did text me Saturday that she had just made fresh-baked cookies… so I ducked out of puzzling briefly, because I liked her an awful lot, and also, fresh-baked cookies. We got married at City Hall a month ago.!#@p!#@Hunt is a weekend of escapism in a bleak winter month, bringing together thousands of ridiculous dorks who are ready willing and able to do utterly ridiculous things. The memorable (positive) parts of hunts are the ones which spark wonder, chaos, silliness. You hide flash drives inside donuts, ask people to construct preposterous fashion, twitch play escape rooms, build a goddamn puzzle bed. Even small dashes of whimsy make it go from a list of puzzles to magic. The joys of frantically searching around like you cracked a conspiracy theory. This year, in particular, Death & Mayhem wrote a hunt which knocked it out of the park. I’m still sitting in awe.!#@p!#@It’s my purest form of holiday I can get: a weekend where my brain is filled with joy and trivia and friendship, and I have no room to worry about the omnishambles. I love all types of puzzles in a hunt, but when I think about what it means for it to be MIT’s Mystery Hunt in particular, it doesn’t mean the puzzles must be fundamentally impossible, or the hunt must set records in size or length. It means using the physical environment, collocated on campus for a weekend, to do things, which are limited only by what the writing team decides to do, not by hunters’ willingness to do them.!#@p!#@And so the countdown to Hunt’s kickoff on January 16, 2026 begins anew, complete with new challenges, and new memories.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mystery-hunt-mile-markers/
"Ten Years (On Dreams) by Lydia K. '14, MEng '16","Ten years ago, I was exactly where I wanted to be.","by Lydia K. '14, MEng '16","January 23, 2025","What is your name?!#@p!#@Lydia Andreyevna Krasilnikova.!#@p!#@Where do you live now?!#@p!#@Cambridge, MA, USA.!#@p!#@What is your occupation or field that you work in?!#@p!#@I am a computational biologist. I study infectious disease and disease outbreaks. I also draw space cows and occasionally write articles about scientist culture.!#@p!#@What are some life events that have occurred? (marriage, children, education, achievements, etc.)!#@p!#@I got my SB and MEng and am currently working on my PhD. My partner Cory and I have been together for almost nine years now. We met in college (lived in the same dorm). He’s a mechanical engineer. No kids (yet).!#@p!#@What is one unusual experience you have had since graduating from State High?!#@p!#@Teaching was weird. One of my first times reserving a room for office hours I waited way too late and the room I got was a special room above the Museum. I got a message saying I would need to pick up a key. When I came by to pick up the key the person in charge was flustered and very confused, told me I wasn’t supposed to have been able to reserve that room at all, and finally said I could have the room just for this week but that I and my students were not to eat anything while in the room and that we were absolutely not allowed to touch anything. Anyway, it turned out to be the human specimens room. It was full of skeletons, human skeletons and skeletons of human-like primates, and skulls on shelves behind glass, and stacked little cardboard boxes that I can only assume contained more bones. (In addition, the lights were automatic and apparently I don’t move that much because they kept turning off.) No students showed up to office hours that week.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@High school was a magical time. I was obsessed with the radio, and I carried around a little wind-up Grundig. I knew all the stations in our town, and in the neighboring towns, and I vividly remember the staticky morning talk show wake-ups and the smell of the wet morning air in the early autumn and the hope I had for every single day. I knew all the genres of stations, and I thought I knew all the genres of people. I dressed in mostly all black, with one non-black color at a time, ostensibly to show everyone I was hardcore but secretly because I had no idea how to match colors. I ruined all my textbooks by pressing leaves between the pages. I was always late, especially to first period, and I got a decent chunk of my best studying done in detention and Saturday school with my favorite math teacher. I learned that authority figures can let you down, and that other people, including some trustworthy adults, can open doors for you and make your dreams possible. I wasn’t yet grateful for nor understood the preciousness of their consistently showing up for me (even as I did not not consistently show up to, well, anything). I unquestioningly thought I could do anything I wanted to do—which to me meant, ultimately, getting into MIT, leading to some unknown secure future, the vision or meaning of which I hadn’t thought through at all (other than, of course, an MIT boyfriend). I hadn’t yet experienced or learned about sexism—or xenophobia, or racism, or imposter syndrome, or the sadder sides of immigration, or most bad things (and I don’t think I would have gotten as far as I have if I had). As far as I knew, I was smart and hardworking and if I decided to do something it got done.!#@p!#@Things that would surprise then me about current me:!#@p!#@If twelve-year-old me, lying on the carpet of her second-story bedroom at 11pm switching between homework and calling friends on the light tan corded phone (yes, actually) and obsessively refreshing the MIT Admissions blogs, could see me, I think, she would be beyond thrilled, floored, some kind of astonished. I achieved most of her dreams. I got into MIT. I blogged for MIT Admissions, which was my browser homepage and obsession (obsession) from ages 12 through 18. I don’t think I can overstate what a big deal that would have been to her. (People even read my writing! Sometimes a lot of people, and sometimes a lot.) I finished a double major that sounds like a triple major. I got an MEng. I got my MIT boyfriend.!#@p!#@Writing it out, it sounds ridiculous. I even got into Harvard for grad school after MIT, which I hadn’t even bothered to imagine. I even wrote for Technology Review, not once but multiple times, in print (my own name, in a byline, in print)—the same magazine a younger me was utterly entranced by at an alum family friend’s parents’ house, the very origin of the foundation for the future self that I spent the next half-decade carefully planning and imagining and singularly working toward. I was even on TV. I was even on the cover of a newspaper. It all happened.!#@p!#@I am not the person I think I thought I would be, nor am I anymore the person who imagined her. I’m steadier, I hope, and my risks are more measured, which may or may not be a good thing. I have thinner skin and a softer shell. I care deeply, far too deeply, about what people think of me—not just the clothes and the music, but my academic accomplishments and my mind and my career. I’m far less confident, even as I’ve progressed academically, even as I’ve gotten far more comfortable around people and inside my own body. I’ve disappointed a lot of people whose opinions I care about, including myself—something that just wasn’t possible back then. I’m more concerned about other people in general, and not just in a bad way. I’m kinder to my body. I’m more concerned about balance.!#@p!#@Sometimes I wonder what that younger me, the designer, the true me, as she seems to be in my head, would do with the opportunities and challenges I have. I wish I could transplant her into my mind for a week, either to take the lead on my work or to sit back and critique. What would she think of my PhD so far? She’d probably work far harder, or at least with more focus, with absolutely no self-doubt. She probably wouldn’t hesitate or wait for permission or approval. Would she be a better self-advocate? Would she be unshakable in pursuing her goals? Would she speak up more aggressively for her ideas, and do a better job of asking for resources to carry them out?!#@p!#@Clearly the thing I miss, really really miss, about the person I used to be is her assured, steady confidence, or at least what I remember as assured, steady confidence. Where did it come from? Supportive parents? A stable, comfortable home and academic life? Mostly supportive teachers, at least in the subjects that mattered? Easier, less open-ended day-to-day tasks with tangible goals and endpoints? Did it come from not having yet experienced a pileup of history of failure? a lack of exposure to criticism? not yet having experienced or named sexism and the various usual injustices? Was it just a quality of being a teenager, some level of blindness to failure or criticism—social skills sufficiently underdeveloped to not notice or care about anyone’s opinion of me or have my own real opinion or awareness of myself? Did I simply not have an awareness of the distance between myself and the person I wanted to be? Or was the person I wanted to be sufficiently vague or shrouded in distant adulthood to be beyond comparison? Did being a child make my shortcomings easier for me to accept? Or was it perhaps something more positive: a healthier attitude about failure, or something that gave me the perspective to not be wobbled by it? Was it the constant, hovering presence of a professional goal that reached beyond any one person or subgoal, large enough and far enough away that it could be reached by wiggling around any steps I missed? Was it my many, many hobbies, giving me something other than my career to invest my heart into? Was it the presence and support of family and friends who I felt truly knew me?—in which case, was it the ability to talk through setbacks or negative experiences or my perception of another person’s judgement, again and again and again, to several separate people? or was it the knowledge that here, in this place where I am safe, are people who love me, even knowing me? Perhaps knowing that there are people who consistently see me and consistently love me cause feeling otherwise unloved or unseen to become bearable, any other person’s opinion or moods not quite as important. Or is the problem with self-worth during a PhD the concentration of responsibility for evaluation into a far smaller number of people, sometimes just one, often for an entire six years? In that case, it should be important to de-densify that authority—introduce more mentors, more authority figures, preferably some of them supportive to balance out any overweighed trauma from the others.!#@p!#@One idea that has been causing me particular dissonance is that high school me seemed to have time for everything. She filled up the school day with nonstop classes, cramming more classes where there were supposed to be study halls or lunch periods, missing a few days a week of easier classes to cram even more classes in where they already literally couldn’t fit. But I don’t remember homework or classes being my whole life, or even most of it. My memories are mostly in between classes (gossiping, so much gossiping, holding hands, making out in the hallway—horrifyingly embarrassing to think of now) or, especially, before and after school. A lot of my social life was in Science Olympiad—more gossiping, learning to use power tools (and hot glue and gorilla glue and gorilla tape), building tiny cars and water clocks and wooden airplanes I was so proud of—, starting in eighth grade and ending in eleventh, when I left high school. I was obsessed (obsessed) with getting the team to Nationals (I didn’t—we didn’t, and I cried on the last bus ride home from States). I kayaked multiple days a week and most of the weekend many weekends, especially in the not-freezing seasons. On top of that my family went on near constant adventures, skiing and biking and hiking and weekend camping trips around Pennsylvania. I also remember long nights coding personal projects, working on my first attempt(s) at a blog, trying to learn to sew clothes, baking experiments like that handful of times I made phyllo dough from scratch. And then my obsession with photography, going on what I called photography expeditions, then spending hours and hours editing photos of butterflies or trees or sunsets or the moon and adding a color-coordinated border and uploading to deviantART and talking with strangers online about my photographs and their photographs and about photography in general. And, of course, constantly AIM-ing with my friends, dissecting and analyzing crushes and homework and teachers and goals—this not including the hour a day dedicated to phone calls with boyfriends or prospective boyfriends or the time spent vaguely hanging out/loitering on school property or playing hide-and-seek tag after dark on Fridays in the park on the way home from school (that and another form of tag on the actual playground equipment right when it got just dark enough for someone to get injured on playground equipment but yet not dark enough to make hide-and-seek extra spooky).!#@p!#@There definitely wasn’t actually enough time: I cut class or slept through class or got sick and missed class constantly, at least once a week, which must have been an awful rollercoaster for my parents and a ridiculous mess for my teachers to watch and try to grapple with year after year after year. I would pull all-nighters to get work done, only to fall asleep and miss class and not turn in the work I did anyway. Then turn work in late; then probably fall behind, though I don’t actually remember ever being behind. Then do it again. (The trick was to get into just enough trouble to get Saturday school, rather than several far less productive detentions, but not enough trouble to warrant an even less productive in-school suspension.)!#@p!#@And yet I remember this time, and my time at MIT right after it, as remarkably productive, even though I definitely spent far more time on things that are not my job than I do now. Which is too bad—it seems I am working harder, but far less effectively, perhaps because I am working harder.!#@p!#@So here are some action items, borrowed from a happy childhood, to cultivate well-earned self-confidence for a better, less traumatizing, perhaps even empowering PhD/current career stage experience—maybe even a better, less traumatizing career overall.!#@p!#@Update: my favorite math teacher, who presided over Saturday school, has informed me that apparently while I did have Saturday school sometimes, I mostly showed up voluntarily, just for fun, to sit and work and be focused. (What a nerd.)!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@What is your name?!#@p!#@Lydia Andreyevna (soon to be Robinson) Krasilnikova.!#@p!#@Where do you live now?!#@p!#@Malden, MA, USA.!#@p!#@What is your occupation or field that you work in?!#@p!#@Public health.!#@p!#@What are some life events that have occurred? (marriage, children, education, achievements, etc.)!#@p!#@PhD, house, engagement, new job, cat.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@As I write this I am at home, in the living room. The living room is where I spend most of my waking hours. It’s small. It’s got a futon, a TV, shelves with Legos and books, a fancy coffee table we got off the street in Cambridge, and cute bar stools that look like burnt marshmallows facing the countertop that connects the living room and the kitchen. Almost a year later we’re still not completely unpacked, but the living room is the room we perfected first.!#@p!#@As I write this I am sitting on the Orange Line. I get on at the end of the line and I get off at the other end of the line, and then in the evenings I do the same thing in reverse. We’re nearing the end of the line, and the train is clearing out. From the outside the Orange Line train looks like a giant bug, something wormy and segmented.!#@p!#@As I write this I am sitting at my desk at work, during my union-mandated break. I work at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, for the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. My chair is a comfortable spinny chair and my desk can set itself to any height (sometimes even a height I am interested in it setting itself to). There are no personal effects on my desk or pinned to the walls of my cubicle, but that’s because I’m new here and I take the train, and personal effects are hard to take on the train. I sit next to the arbovirus team, which I like because I get to hear about their adventures collecting ticks all over Massachusetts. I myself don’t go on adventures for work, but I like being around people who do. In grad school I was in a department for zoology and botany and evolution, which meant that most of my peers spent summers hunting down frogs or ferns or a specific species of flower.!#@p!#@My side of grad school was evolution: specifically, viral evolution, which can be used to trace a virus as it moves from person to person and mutates along the way. I study disease outbreaks using the genomes of the pathogens at fault. (You know how you can sequence the human genome? We sequence everything in you that isn’t human.) In my day-to-day I write code, I do statistics and make graphs, I organize and attend meetings, and I write and read papers. Today, I am working on a subtype classification system for the virus I’m currently focusing on (no spoilers!), but today is an unusual day. Most days I analyze outbreaks of that virus: I’m looking to learn how far it spread, whom it spread through, and how well contact tracing, vaccination, and other interventions worked. I’ve been analyzing outbreaks like this one for about a decade, starting during my MEng at MIT and then through my PhD. The job stays interesting: I get to jump around from pathogen to pathogen, and the things we can do with pathogen genomes get cooler every year.!#@p!#@I also write and draw. I am now, finally, writing fiction. I’m on the third draft of my first novel, which is a ghost story about mortgages set in Salem on Halloween. (It’s a weird combo. Wish me luck.) I wrote it largely on my phone on the train, which I’m pretty proud of.!#@p!#@Here’s a timeline of my career:!#@p!#@And here’s a timeline of where I’ve lived:!#@p!#@The house was the best we could do in the circumstances, those circumstances being Boston housing costs and me tanking my earnings by going to grad school over and over again. (Highly recommend, but from what I’ve heard it’s unlikely I will ever catch up financially to my friends who did not go to grad school.) The house is very old and it has a lot of doors. (The first floor kitchen holds the record at five doors.) Cory is a mechanical engineer, so he fixes and builds things. I paint things and make phone calls. So far we have fixed up the first and third floors, and we are slowly working on the second floor as we live in it. But that is all small: sometime in the spring we are having the front porch rebuilt because it is falling off the house and we are having the structural beams that hold up the house swapped out for new ones for similarly good reasons. We have a plumbing and electrical loan, a maxed-out (temporarily interest-free) credit card, and a construction loan almost the size of another down payment. I like to brag about our debt, but this was our secret strategy: buy a huge house no one else will bid on at a price we can afford, then get it livable before the plan falls in on itself like a house of cards. I’ll let you know later if the gamble was good.!#@p!#@I don’t have a lot to complain about. I have a family that loves me whom I love back, I have good friends who have stuck with me through hard times, I have an entire house (which is technically two entire houses), I have four cities that feel like home (Boston, State College, Myrtle Beach, and Key Largo), I have a tuxedo kitten who thinks I’m his mother, I have a job that I love with people I like, I got to go to Harvard for grad school (a reach goal from undergrad), I got to go to MIT (my dream since I was 12), and I’m engaged (engaged!) (to the MIT engineer I dreamed of finding since probably about the same age). No dream has come close to my dream of going to MIT. Nothing has ever felt as bright as that. But I want to have kids, I want to be able to afford to fix up our house and get Cory a new (used) car, and I want to be a published fiction author. Someday, once everything is paid for, I’d like to buy and fix up more Malden two-families. (I’m learning way too much and having way too much fun with this one not to do it all again.)!#@p!#@I want to say that my hopes for my future today don’t feel as sparkly as my dreams felt in high school—specifically my dream of getting into MIT. Maybe it’s because I’m older, maybe it’s because I spent some time listless, maybe it’s because I’m content. But why would I say that? Getting engaged felt good, uniquely good. I think having kids would feel good in a unique way, too. I’ve wanted to write fiction for as long as I wanted to go to MIT (longer, even), so maybe getting a book deal would feel just as good. And I think really liking the state of my home and having a modern car and having everything paid off would feel like relief and stability.!#@p!#@I don’t know what I thought my post-MIT dreams would look like. Change the world for the better, first and foremost? An easy checkmark—I’m lucky that my day job does that. Get rich? A more challenging checkmark, given that day job, and with wealth defined as stability. (I think if you can stably afford a house and kids in the greater Boston area and go out to restaurants and buy expensive lattes at fancy local coffee shops and travel for vacations, you’re pretty rich.) Get famous? Never famous enough to be recognized, but as famous as seeing my name on some of the books at Hudson News when I fly (I’m terrified of flying, but I think if my name was on books sold at airports I’d like it quite a bit more.) and people seeing my name on a talk or a paper in public health, recognizing it, and thinking it’s probably a good talk or paper (and I’d also, in this fantasy world, like for that thought to be true).!#@p!#@It’s not MIT, but is it a dream? Do I need a dream?!#@p!#@I don’t have an answer to that question. My twenties have turned into my thirties and while I don’t have a guiding North Star, I do have goals and hopes. Here’s what I’m grappling with: without a defining dream, my work still has purpose and my life still has meaning. Is that enough? Is it enough to do good work and to be content? In high school, it was easy to find something big to reach for. Is there a parallel in adulthood, for me?!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@As I write this I would have been in Random Hall, on BMF, at my desk with the door open to the long hallway joining the back stairwell and the two donut-shaped (if you look down from above, which few people do) buildings, which gave me an excellent view of anyone coming or going. In January 2015 I would have been halfway through the first year of my MEng. I would have been gearing up to TA my second semester of 6.005 (which later became 6.031), and I would have just joined the Sabeti Lab with no idea it would be my home for the next decade.!#@p!#@These were the beginnings of the listless years. A PhD was on the horizon, maybe. A job was on the horizon, maybe. I didn’t know where I was going and I certainly did not have a plan. My biggest dream thus far, MIT, was coming to a close, and I didn’t have a replacement. And ten years older, ten years more content, ten years happier, I still don’t have a replacement.!#@p!#@Things that would surprise then me about current me:!#@p!#@And, based on that, some action items:!#@p!#@Back then, I couldn’t have known I would become dreamless—happy, busy, doing good things, but dreamless. An MEng is not technically supposed to be two years long, and a person isn’t supposed to spend 14 years mostly within a two-mile radius, but I wanted to stick around MIT for as long as I could. Who wouldn’t? I was exactly where I wanted to be. I was home.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ten-years-on-dreams/
Full Circle by Anna H. '14,Professor Anna,by Anna H. '14,"January 23, 2025","I’m sitting on the floor of my living room in Ithaca, New York. It’s snowing outside and the windows are cloudy with condensation. A couple of days ago I got back from Ireland, where I gave a seminar and served as the external examiner (“extern”) for a PhD Viva, and now I’m trying to get my act together before the semester starts on Tuesday.!#@p!#@The last time I wrote a blog post was July 2020, when I had just defended my own PhD. There’s a coda to that story. Over a decade ago (!), when I was an undergrad at MIT, I got a book in the mail from an author I nicknamed “Shakespeare.” The book was about astronomy research at an observatory in the 1960s, and I ended up doing my graduate work at the same observatory. After my PhD defense, I mailed the author a hard copy of my dissertation, along with a letter describing all the exciting new science happening at the observatory. I wasn’t expecting a response, so when I entered my office and saw a letter from Shakespeare lying on my desk, I opened it without sitting down or taking off my backpack. The letter was in blue ink on very thin, soft, cream-colored paper. “Dear Anna,” it read, “One handwritten note deserves another.” He said he remembered sending me that book while I was at MIT, that it had been his first book, and that at the time he had no idea if he could actually write a book, but that the encouragement and respect of others helped get him there.!#@p!#@Today I’m writing as a professor of astronomy. In between, I spent a couple of years as a postdoc, where I spent the vast majority of my time doing research. The transition from being a postdoc to being a faculty member was the most abrupt of my career because it came with the most new responsibilities: I teach undergraduate and graduate classes, fundraise and manage a budget for a research program, supervise a group of postdocs and students, and serve on departmental committees. I had done bits and pieces of each before, but the shift in scale was dramatic. I knew that it would be: when I solicited advice before my move, I was told that “nobody [is ever ready for a faculty position] because the demands are impossible,” and that I should define my own goals–in other words, decide which aspects of the job I wanted to excel at, because no one could excel at all of them.!#@p!#@So, the job is not easy, but it’s deeply rewarding in many respects. I feel genuine excitement about learning how the universe works–a feeling that has not changed at all since I was an undergrad–and I’ve learned that this is precious, a flame to protect from burning out. I get to study the cosmos with students and postdocs who amaze me with their individual talents and their generosity with one other. My first undergraduate mentee recently graduated, and went off to get her PhD; I stuck the program from her commencement to the wall of my office. I have regulars at office hours whose interest in the subject reignites my own. I work with people from all over the world.!#@p!#@Looking over my MIT blogs now, I’m struck by how many threads have continued–the things I enjoy, the way I approach challenges–and also by how the perspective has flipped. Instead of being the undergrad whose eyes are glazing over in lecture because she stayed up until 6am doing way too many activities, I’m the professor who sees a student’s eyes glaze over while I’m lecturing and feels retrospective embarrassment at how obvious inattention is to the person at the front of the room. (To all my former professors, I would just like to say: I’m sorry. I thought you might not be able to tell.) Instead of scrambling to find a research position, I receive emails from students and although I do my best to respond, I sadly don’t have the bandwidth to work with all of them, and hope that my unavailability is not discouraging. Instead of being in a panicked state about choosing classes and a major, I meet with students who are making the same decisions. I remember my first conference, and now I send students to that same conference and hope that the environment is just as welcoming. I remember how it felt to write my first observing proposal, and this summer I took my students out to ice cream to celebrate their first proposal success, with the same telescope.!#@p!#@A favorite high school teacher once told me that it was important “always to find [one’s] points of equilibrium.” An academic career often entails moving: in the past decade I’ve lived in five very different places, spanning what has felt to me like at least three different phases of life. In each phase, equilibrium has had a different meaning: I’ve seen my needs and priorities change, and I know that they will change again in the next few years. I was nervous about moving to Ithaca, and the beginning was difficult, but I knew that things would rebalance. Sure enough, I made friends, signed up for many mailing lists (which reminded me a lot of moving to MIT!), joined a choir, started taking singing lessons, and found a volunteering role at Cornell’s Lab of Ornithology–it just took some time.!#@p!#@Birds have always been a latent interest, and after moving here I particularly wanted to see owls. About a year ago, during the area’s annual bird count, I met someone who knew the owl guy. She gave me a name (let’s call him Bill) and a phone number, and said to text him. I texted Bill asking if I could tag along, and his instructions were to meet him at the Lab of Ornithology north parking lot at 3:45am. So that’s how I found myself bundled up in the back of a stranger’s car at the crack of dawn on New Year’s Day. We heard 14 Eastern screech owls, and saw 3 of them. They are tiny and very adorable.!#@p!#@The sun has pretty much set, so I’ll wrap up here. Thank you to Ceri and Chris for organizing the blog anniversary and see you all in…(yikes…)…ten years?!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG-20220810-WA0000-1-1000x750.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG-20220810-WA0000-1-1000x750.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/full-circle/
Hi again (and goodbye) by Elizabeth Choe '13,(For real this time!),by Elizabeth Choe '13,"January 23, 2025","When Petey messaged the blogger alums about coming back and posting for the 20th anniversary of the blogs, I originally hadn’t planned on writing anything. And that is because while everyone else has been checking in from all corners of the world and sharing the many adventures post-MIT life has taken them on, I, uh, never actually left MIT.!#@p!#@See, after graduating from Course 20 in 2013, I ran an educational media outreach program in MIT Open Learning for a few years (working with Ceri!) while doing some independent video production on the side. Then I came “back home” to Admissions, helping to run these very blogs with Petey while also working at the MIT Media Lab’s then-called Learning Initiative. In 2018, I started my PhD in Course 20. Just the other week I had a lovely lunch with Ceri, Petey, rfong, and Danny in the schmancy new Admissions building. Bryan is now a professor in Course 20 who I saw every week for the past 6 years. I have lived in the 01239 zip code for almost half of my life. MY KERBEROS⁠01 HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS. Honestly, what is there to catch up on?!#@p!#@The catching up is that I finally left MIT and started a new gig leading science communications for an oncology-and-AI research group at a big biotech company a few months ago. But I don’t think it’ll feel real until May, when, by some poetic stroke of coincidence, I both walk across the graduation stage, bidding official adieu to the place that raised me (and my Kerb finally expires), and I also get married and really start life sans MIT. Truth is, I have been a bit in emotional denial over the whole thing, and as I messaged Petey, “I am reluctant to write because I am afraid of what will come out of me. Lol.” How do I distill the last 15 years into one farewell post?!#@p!#@Let’s start with the easy things, the stuff that hasn’t changed:!#@p!#@And yet, so much else has changed:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-11.11.59-AM-800x597.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9510.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_5097-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/57042243154__FD9C20AB-7318-4C5F-858E-10A99EBA863D-800x680.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/190604_post_quals_suprise_0071-copy-800x534.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-11.30.11-AM-800x1247.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0042-800x600.jpg]!#@MIT—I hated it.

Don’t forget to check in with yourself by Jenny X. '13,On living with intention,by Jenny X. '13,"January 23, 2025","When I think about my time at MIT, my first thought is: it still feels like just yesterday (I graduated in 2013). Last year, I had the chance to walk through campus, down the infinite, with my 9-month old baby — and it all still felt like home.!#@p!#@Okay, all the places I loved to eat at are gone (RIP Shinkansen, Steam Cafe, Cafe 4…are food trucks still a thing? Someone let me know in the comments 😉); my favorite Hayden Library got a modern makeover; there are multiple brand new buildings changing views forever (looking at you, Music Building; also MIT Nano is very cool to peer into). But! I still have so many specific MIT memories I’ll delight in for the rest of my life, probably in part because many of my closest friends are still those I met at MIT (including my husband), and there are just a whole lot of stories to reminisce about and tell over and over again among us. I am so grateful for this.!#@p!#@When I think about my blogs on here, the post I think about the most is: “Be yourself or create yourself?” The contrast in the title is a catchy way to describe the challenge of growing as a person, but I’ve since learned that it’s a false dichotomy… because 1) it doesn’t have to be one or the other, and 2) it’s not a one-time decision.!#@p!#@These days, I instead regularly ask, “What do I want?” What do I want to be, to do, to give attention to? It sounds like a simple question but it can get harder to answer over time because first you have to make time to pause and interrogate yourself and when you finally manage to, you have to be really, really honest. Still, I find it an interrogation worth going through, again and again.!#@p!#@After graduating (as an architecture major plotting to become a writer), I went into journalism for almost 10 years — until 2022, when I was able to take a 6-month sabbatical of sorts. During this period, I was fortunate to enjoy slow mornings, frequent walks around the neighborhood, and yes, a lot of time to ask, what do I want?!#@p!#@Long story short, on the job front, I decided to pivot into UX writing/content design (words and storytelling for digital products essentially, which sort of makes sense in terms of combining my writing and design backgrounds). I really enjoy the work and want to keep going in this discipline. But job aside, I’ve also distilled what I want to spend time and attention on into these three things, from the actionable to the abstract:!#@p!#@The specifics of what I do or the path from here on out and the timing of it all… I don’t know! But it feels good to clarify the general direction (at least for this particular phase of my life/version of myself). Currently, I do a lot of thinking/writing/exploring on those bullet points in my Substacks, most regularly on Ode, a newsletter about shopping with intention and building a fulfilling wardrobe. A recent post on a dozen ways to stop wanting to buy clothes all the time resonated with many.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/odescreenshot-1000x557.jpg]!#@I’ll end here with some of the biggest influences that have pushed me to think about what I really want vs. what I think I want and what the world seems to want from me:!#@p!#@Happy 20th anniversary, MIT blogs!

"MIT, Medicine, and Success from Any School by Ahmed H. '12",thirteen years in a thousand words,by Ahmed H. '12,"January 22, 2025","In 2012 everything about life at MIT felt important: Course 9,⁠01 UROPs,⁠02 WMBR,⁠03 MIT-EMS,⁠04 Model UN,⁠05 blogging.⁠06 It was all so monumental.!#@p!#@Thirteen years of hindsight have flattened the relief map of events in my memory. Only two incidents among countless all-nighters, events, and projects in four years in Cambridge (2008-2012) have any tangible bearing on my trajectory as I time travel at a rate of one second per second:!#@p!#@1. I met Sarah ’10, became friends, asked her out, proposed, got married, and the rest is history–we’ve been happily married, now with two dogs, for eleven years. The impact of meeting her is self-evident (that’s as romantic as this will get).!#@p!#@2. Vidya ’12 approached me after class to ask, “Did you see that LSU is taking out-of-state students?”!#@p!#@That one requires explanation.!#@p!#@We were deep in the medical school application cycle in the Fall of 2011. I applied to 27 schools but had only one interview. This was due to two factors: First, my middling GPA even in Course 9, after turning down the opportunity to “earn” inflated grades literally anywhere else. It felt like I was the only one of my cohort not making straight A’s, suggesting that it was possible (though perhaps not for me) to compete GPA-wise with applicants from Harvard and other less-rigorous schools⁠07 as an MIT pre-med. And second, my procrastination in submitting applications, which are reviewed on a rolling basis.!#@p!#@Despite being from New Orleans, I had not applied to LSU because they only accepted Louisiana residents–their strict definition of which I did not technically meet. LSU revised that policy mid-cycle and announced their intent to admit a handful of out-of-state students for the first time. Vidya, aware of my unprovable connection to the state and my struggles in the application season, shared the news that had somehow escaped my attention.!#@p!#@I applied that day, and received an interview invitation and ultimately my acceptance letter on Tuesday, February 21, 2012: Mardi Gras.!#@p!#@One medical school admission is exactly as good as 28. That offhand comment, which Vidya⁠08 says she doesn’t even remember, changed the course of my life.!#@p!#@Sarah and I moved, freshly affianced, to New Orleans. I took a brief detour to beautiful Maxwell AFB, Alabama to dedicate my career to the Air Force in exchange for tuition.!#@p!#@As for med school itself, I found it difficult even after surviving the Institute. There was a joke that maybe still exists at MIT: “Our tests are like, ‘The density of water is 1gm/cm3. Calculate the mass of the sun.'” Learning in medical school is the opposite of that. There is no room for independent thought. It’s all rote memorization. Every structure–nerve, artery, vein, bone, organ–and their embryologies, courses, features, functions, relations to surrounding structures, must be memorized. These answers cannot be intuited nor derived with a back-of-the-envelope calculation. In comparison, MIT’s “firehose” was an old man at a urinal.!#@p!#@But this too I survived. Along the way, I realized that Neurology isn’t for me because books are for nerds, and that I needed to work with my hands. My OBGYN rotation coincided with the realization that I loved surgery but hated General Surgery, and that OBGYNs also operate. It additionally coincided with my grandmother’s stage IV ovarian cancer diagnosis. Fate conspired to make me an OBGYN⁠09 —the specialty I was least likely to pursue as a pre-med—and eventually a gynecologic oncologist.!#@p!#@I completed OBGYN residency at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia, 2016-2020. Then I took unaccompanied orders to RAF Lakenheath near Cambridge (the English one) for two years, where despite the pandemic Sarah and I traveled all over Europe⁠10 and generally had the Best Time. I returned to NMCP for two additional years, all the while waiting for the Air Force to offer a GYN oncology training position. As a very specialized field, slots aren’t offered every year. My time finally came when I was selected to begin fellowship in July 2024.!#@p!#@Which leads us to the present day, where I am a gynecologic oncology fellow⁠11 in Washington DC. I love asking questions to move an entire field forward. My main research project involves advanced-stage ovarian cancer (for you, Mama), to devise a blood test to determine which patients should have chemotherapy first then surgery, vs surgery then chemo. Without getting into the weeds, this decision is a longstanding dilemma in devising treatment plans for patients with ovarian cancer.!#@p!#@And then there’s the clinical side, which is my true passion. Painstakingly removing every remnant of cancer in a patient’s abdomen. Answering an obstetrician’s bat signal when they find an unexpected accreta,⁠12 and despite entering the game already down 4 liters of blood, waving our wands and then three days later watching mom walk out of the hospital, baby in arms. Telling a patient that her post-chemo CT scan shows no evidence of disease. Telling a patient that her surveillance CT scan shows return of disease, but that new treatments provide hope. Telling a patient that her CT scan shows widespread worsening disease, and guiding her to a death with dignity, on her terms.!#@p!#@Revisiting the original musing: What was important about MIT? Moreover, what was exclusive to my experience at MIT, that still impacts my life today?!#@p!#@At risk of stumbling into a “friends we made along the way”-adjacent ending, if I went to another school there would be no Vidya looking over my shoulder. There would be no Sarah.!#@p!#@But many students get into medical school from University of Northeastern [Flyover State]-[Suburb] Campus or Harvard. Hell, they probably have an easier time of it with a higher GPA and class rank.⁠13!#@p!#@If I had not attended MIT, would I have gotten into medical school? Would I have found love, and also two Weimaraners?!#@p!#@Maybe. Almost certainly, even.!#@p!#@I’m glad I never had to find out.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-medicine-and-success-from-any-school/
14 years later by Yan Z. '12,what I've been up to in the past one-seventh of a century,by Yan Z. '12,"January 22, 2025","Hi! Remember me? It’s only been 14 years since my last MIT Admissions blog!!#@p!#@Back then, I was a starry-eyed over-caffeinated food-obsessed Course 8 major with a penchant for iconic phrases like, “Could this brutalist hallway be any more translation-invariant??!”!#@p!#@A lot has happened since those halcyon days when virtually nobody had a smartphone unless they were participating in a Media Lab study. (Yes, we would dash from lecture halls to Athena clusters, 15” Dell Inspirons clutched tightly under-arm, to scintillate our understimulated brains by opening emails with subject lines like “free leftover iceberg lettuce in E52”; in fact, a single TikTok in 2025 delivers more dopamine than we would experience in an entire school year.) Besides a global pandemic, at least three decent memes, and the rise of LLMs like the one writing this blog post, the years 2011-2024 bore witness to my transformation from a directionless physics major into a jaded programmer.!#@p!#@What happened, you ask? Well, in my senior year at MIT, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do after college, so I took the path of least cranial activity and applied to physics graduate school. In case that didn’t work out, I also applied to what I thought to be two safe backup options: unpaid laborer on an organic farm in Hawaii and coordinator at an open science nonprofit. As it so happened, I was rejected from both of those jobs and accepted to all four Physics PhD programs as well as the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, a predicament eerily reminiscent of when I got rejected from The Cheesecake Factory but accepted to MIT in my junior year of high school (after which I dropped out). After weeks of first-world agony over which top-tier astrophysics PhD offer I should accept, I decided to go to Stanford.!#@p!#@Despite doing well academically, I had a depressing first trimester and took a leave of absence at the end of it. In January of 2013, I had no income, no permanent residence, and apparently no hireable skills in the startup-crazed city of San Francisco. No matter how many tech companies I sent a resume to, nobody wanted to interview me. Internally, I knew I’d find some way to prove myself to them; it just wasn’t going to be straightforward.!#@p!#@Although my only real coding experience was a month-long IAP course where the first assignment was to implement RSA encryption in Scheme, I had already been indoctrinated into the free software movement by my MIT housemates. Plus I was paranoid about online privacy and using PGP to encrypt my emails, thanks to renowned whistleblower Chelsea Manning visiting the aforementioned house at MIT shortly before doing the aforementioned whistleblowing. With interests like these, I naturally gravitated toward the burgeoning 2010s cypherpunk movement, learning to program by contributing open source code to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Tor, teaching myself the basics of cybersecurity, and losing out on millions of dollars by understanding the cryptography behind Bitcoin but not buying it. Slowly but surely, I started convincing friends who were running shoestring-budget startups and nonprofits to pay me something resembling minimum wage for my time as a programmer and security auditor.!#@p!#@After almost a year of clawing through the SF technocracy, all while sharing a room with an MIT dropout who had run away to join the circus (neither of us could afford the full $900/month rent), I finally received two dream job offers on a cold November night. One was to be the first security engineer at a small company called Stripe, founded by some of my MIT friends during a summer in which I was incessantly annoyed with one of them for forgetting his kitchen duties (I had no idea what could be more important). The other was to join the Electronic Frontier Foundation as a Staff Technologist, under the wing of Peter Eckersley, a dear friend and mentor who sadly passed away in 2022. Everyone told me to join Stripe, but I picked EFF in the end.!#@p!#@The rest, as they say, is history. I won’t bore you now with my career minutiae, but some of my proudest achievements are helping secure over 500 million websites by launching Let’s Encrypt, finding a vulnerability that allowed me to remotely sniff browsing history, triumphantly sauntering back onto the Stanford campus to give a guest lecture in web security, and building a new web browser called Brave, of which I’m currently the Chief Information Security Officer.!#@p!#@Morals of the story:!#@p!#@Anyways, no blog post is complete without pictures, so here are 14 photos from 2024 to compensate for my 14-year hiatus.!#@p!#@Starting off with a slice of my idyllic post-graduation life, here’s a sweater I knit for a bunny at my local rabbit shelter, who was chilly because he had to be shaved:!#@p!#@The Bay Area had a rainy winter, which meant wild mushrooms were plentiful by February. We took a foraging class and crawled through many, many wet brambles to unearth these:!#@p!#@Afterwards we cooked and ate the mushrooms that were unambiguously not going to kill us.!#@p!#@Later that month we took a short trip to Tahoe to traipse around in snow, which I’d experienced once or twice at MIT.!#@p!#@Azuki, my 9 year-old beloved pet bunny, had to go to the vet for a tooth trim.!#@p!#@After the pain meds kicked in, he was very floppy and needed help flipping over.!#@p!#@Fast-forward to August. We traveled to China and stopped by the Malaysian Durian Festival, which was (confusingly) in Hong Kong, because we are durian fanatics connoisseurs.!#@p!#@Apparently that wasn’t enough durian, because afterwards we went to Singapore and experienced a “Durian Omakase.”!#@p!#@By the time I got back to San Francisco, it was peak fig season!!#@p!#@Sadly, California’s bountiful autumn was cut short when I was forced to travel across the Atlantic for a work trip. Actually this was quite exciting as my company works remotely, and many of us have never met in person. I gave a few presentations and participated in a hackathon which was really fun.!#@p!#@When I got back to SF, it was both election season and Halloween season simultaneously. We celebrated by putting up a spooky spider collecting election mail.!#@p!#@I wanted to share the spider on something the kids these days call “Instagram,” so I went to the library to do some research. Good thing these books never go out of date!!#@p!#@Having lived in SF for over a decade, you’d think that by now I would have found all the scenic ocean views. Nope. Here’s one that completely escaped my notice until November 2024:!#@p!#@One of the perks of living in the Bay Area is an unending supply of jaw-dropping sunsets. Eventually you get used to it and stop noticing them, but you take the picture anyway to prove on social media that you went outside.!#@p!#@That’s all for now. See you in another 14 years!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/14-years-later/
That rings a bell by Elijah T. '11,Made of brass?,by Elijah T. '11,"January 21, 2025","Nearly fourteen years after graduating, I still wear my Brass Rat every day. It feels strange when it’s not on my finger. I panic when I can’t find it. (That was a long lonely month when I thought I lost it for good, only for it to ultimately reappear under the couch.) I don’t know how long alumni typically wear it – I’ve spotted it on the fingers of a few others my age – but it has been present in all aspects of my life ever since leaving MIT. And it’s a constant reminder to me (and others) of my time there.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ring-400x287.jpg]!#@As a Course 1 (Civil Engineering) alum, I moved west to Palo Alto for my master’s and decided to stay when I realized I never want to have to shovel snow again. While I’ve seen others tempted by the fruits of Silicon Valley or otherwise find their passion elsewhere, I have stayed as a civil engineer throughout my career, working on a variety of projects – bridges, automated trains, ports, etc. During interviews, or sometimes just casually at work, my time at MIT still comes up (while I blush at them saying how impressive my academic background is). One can of course see that from my resume, but the ring has occasionally been a talking point as they recall colleagues or friends (or him/herself) having gone to the Institute.!#@p!#@After several study and work abroad opportunities at MIT, I thought those travel days were over once I began working. Somewhat to my surprise though, despite having a full-time job, I have continued to travel frequently, even working in South Korea for a year and, more recently, Singapore for over two years (until the pandemic happened and they reconsidered whether it was the best time to be building a new airport terminal). During one of those adventures, at a restaurant in Rome, a man spotted my ring from another table and struck up a conversation. He was an MIT graduate from the 1970s, and even decades later the ring was identifiable.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/me-in-sg-2-1000x1232.jpg]!#@Back at home in San Francisco, I went to pick up a robot vacuum for sale on Facebook Marketplace. As is often the case, there is that worry about me being scammed or walking into an axe murderer’s lair. But I felt a sense of trust when the seller saw my ring and related how she also was an MIT graduate. She passed two-factor authentication when she described her major by her number. (So I wasn’t too concerned when I discovered shortly afterward that the vacuum wouldn’t charge; she promptly sent me a refund without even taking the vacuum back. Not a scam!)!#@p!#@And these don’t even consider the many other times it has been a source of instant connection. I attend many board game and gaming meetups (think Blood on the Clocktower, not Dungeons and Dragons). At one such event, a fellow alum gasped in excitement when she saw me wearing the ring in the wild (and I gasped in despair at how old I was when she talked about how she endured the pandemic lockdown during her freshman year). At other times, it’s an impetus to talk about Mystery Hunt or some other aspect of MIT culture (or legend).!#@p!#@My partner has also asked me about it, wondering whether it’s common for Americans to wear college rings. No, I don’t think so. (Is that lore comparing the Brass Rat to the Super Bowl ring still out there?) But I long ago resolved to continue wearing the Brass Rat daily – at least until I get another ring…!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ring-400x287.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/me-in-sg-2-1000x1232.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/that-rings-a-bell/
"I may have been accepted to MIT, but by Snively '11",I'm getting darned good at failing at other things!,by Snively '11,"January 21, 2025","Hello – my name is Michael. You may know me as Snively. Or you may not know me at all because I wrote blogs back in the dark ages of 2008, nearly 20 years ago, when blogs were something *everybody* wrote in. I’m the author of such classics as!#@p!#@It’s been four years since I’ve written a blog entry here, which seems ridiculous but that’s how it goes. Y’all don’t care about what’s going on in the life of a 30-something MIT grad, y’all want to know about campus culture, dining, UROPS, and all that nonsense. If you’ll indulge me, though, I thought I’d type some stuff. None of it will be as thoughtfully crafted as Chris Su’s, who demonstrated with every blog entry why he was destined to become a successful doctor and I was destined to become a twice-terminated project manager in Indiana :)!#@p!#@I want to get into a heartfelt section here about failure, I really do, but first I want to catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you last heard from me.!#@p!#@In June 2022 my second son was born, named Archer. He was a colicky mess with a funny-shaped head (which eventually sported a very stylish orthotic helmet) but he’s two-and-a-half now and adorable. Here’s him learning to use scissors for the first time at our local library a couple of weeks ago.!#@p!#@My firstborn is now 6 years old. You know all the people making fun of “Rizz” and “Ohio” and “Skibbidi?” My son is the person they’re making fun of. Man, he is ALL IN on Roblox, Skibbidi Toilet, Craftee, Cash and Nico, and all the other weird parts of the internet that make me feel old. Here he is at the same library on the same day, honing his Roblox skills.!#@p!#@Cast your mind back with me to 2016 and a blog entry I wrote about running my first ever marathon. It was Chris Peterson’s fault. Well, by 2023 I’d run four marathons and was looking for something harder. This was dumb. I decided I wanted to run an ultra marathon. This was dumb. I decided I wanted to skip those silly intermediate steps of 50k, 50mi, and 100k, skipping straight to a 100 mile ultra. This was dumb.!#@p!#@[sidenote – as I enter into this “long distance running” section of my entry, I can see media uploads here in WordPress from Chris Su, where he’s smiling, wearing medals, and running marathons at approximately the speed of light. Just more evidence of him making smart decisions and running respectable distances while I make dumb decisions. I’m sure his blog entry will be a delight. Mine will be pain]!#@p!#@So I found an ultra marathon scheduled for August 2023 and began training! I was at a marathon-level of fitness in January 2023, so I just had to get from 26.2 miles up to 100 miles in 8 months. How do you do that? RUN A F***ING LOT. No joke, I was running 6 days a week, 10-13 miles per day (except for weekends, which were trail runs and more like 16-20 miles). Full time job, two kids under 5, and running 13 miles every day. At the beginning (during winter) I could do my morning runs at the YMCA’s indoor track. They opened at 5AM and I was doing shorter distances so I could finish up and make it home, shower, and prep the kids for daycare without too much trouble. As the distances increased I started having to set out at 4AM each morning from my house. Dark days. Literally.!#@p!#@I did it though – I stuck to the training plan and ran all the miles and did all the prep and bought all the shoes (SO MANY SHOES) and even grew a hideous long scary beard so that I’d fit in with all the other ultra runners. And then it was time for the ultra. I’m leaving out a lot of stories but I could write dozens of blog entries about this experience, this is the short version. I set out at 4AM and jogged into the woods. About an hour later I realized a major mistake had been made. I did all my training in Indiana. Good ol’ flat Indiana. The ultra I was running was in eastern Ohio. Good ol’ not-so-flat eastern Ohio. The hills absolutely DEVASTATED me. Ruined me. I fell off the pace by the second aid station and had entered “just ignore the pain and keep going” mode by mile 26. At 11PM, mile 52, after burning 9,000 calories, and running for 19 hours, I collapsed in some rando stranger’s front yard and called in retrieval from my support crew (my parents). They couldn’t find me, so I had a nice half hour to reflect about choices.!#@p!#@Also, for those of you who use Garmin watches, there’s a stat called “Body Battery” – it’s basically a measure of how much energy you have at any given point during the day. If you get good rest and are charged up, you’ll start your day at 100 percent. When you’re just completely exhausted and feel like laying down and sleeping you’ll be at 5 percent (doesn’t dip below 5).  I love my body battery readings from this run.!#@p!#@I start in the mid 60s and bottom out at noon. Then I run 11 hours with zero energy in the tank. Because I’m dumb.!#@p!#@This was one of the first ever super big goals that I set out to conquer and failed at. I made it 50 miles, which was some solace, but ultimately I failed at my goal. 4 months later I’d encounter another failure – I was laid off from my job 3 weeks before Christmas. HAPPY HOLIDAYS! 2 layoffs in less than 4 years.!#@p!#@These three moments – two layoffs and a failed ultramarathon – were fairly transformative. I took a lot away from my first layoff. It was at a job that I saw myself staying at and growing in. It was in an industry that I understood and that I loved. I worked long hours, I established relationships, I volunteered for things, I got bonuses, I was valued, and then when sales dipped I was one of the first to go because I was too expensive. That’s when I realized that I’d endured a lot of stress and lost a lot of weekends and had absolutely nothing to show for it. So I decided to not do that again. And it’s been great. Work 8 to 5, leave work at work, and create clean divisions between professional and personal. Am I climbing the ladder, getting promotion after promotion, making huge money, etc? No. Is that ok? Absolutely. That first layoff was due to COVID so it wasn’t a complete shocker when it happened. The next one, though…!#@p!#@I felt reasonably secure where I was in 2023. I was the most senior project manager, knew our product well, my projects generally came in under budget and I mitigated the damage on the dumpster fires. But sales were down and they needed to roll some heads, so “bye bye most expensive project manager!” Fortunately, after what I learned from my last layoff, the actual experience of sitting in the conference room with HR and being handed a packet wasn’t as jarring as last time. As I walked to my car, sans phone and AMEX, I didn’t feel like I’d given more than I got and I knew the drill. I filed for unemployment, reached out to my network, started applying, and … failed. Good lord, applying to jobs SUCKS. If you’re not getting a referral or an “in” from somebody in your network, and you’re just applying to random job postings, you feel like your soul is being trampled. You just cast cover letter after cover letter into the void, never to be seen again. I had several promising leads that all came from people I knew, but I had ZERO responses from anything I cold-applied to. It was miserable. AND IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME!!#@p!#@I’d exhausted all of my network connections and was interviewing for my very last opportunity and was fortunate enough that it worked out (thank god). By late January I was once again employed :) I’m sure many of you reading this are just going into college, so this advice is 4 years premature, but for the love of god, ESTABLISH A PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK. Whether it’s LinkedIn or some other tool, you NEED a professional safety net, because finding a new job without one is disastrous.!#@p!#@So yeah, I may have gotten into MIT, but I’ve tasted failure for sure. And it’s been ok. To be sure, my failures are insignificant compared to some, and my life is still pretty good, but what’s helped a lot is always trying to find something productive to take away from the failures. Not necessarily a way to avoid them in the future, but an understanding of what led to it and how best to react. My first layoff helped me put the employer/employee relationship into focus and helped me better prioritize my life outside of work. My second layoff instilled in me the value of a network and making connections with all those you work with or near. And the ultra taught me that sometimes, no matter how hard you work, you’re just going to fail, and it’s ok to not succeed at everything you try. And that running ultras sucks.!#@p!#@Tens of thousands of MIT applicants are about to face one of the biggest failures of their lives in 2 short months. If you’re reading this, and you’re applying, you’ll likely not be admitted. Sorry to be a jerk about it, but don’t think for a second that you’re guaranteed to get in or stand a better chance than anybody else. There are going to be over 20,000 applicants for a freshman class of fewer than 1,500. Don’t let this failure ruin you. Be upset, take time to process, but make sure you take something away from it. Find the lesson, whatever it may be for you, and use that to make your journey through life easier when you encounter more failure.!#@p!#@And, you may not want to hear this now, but know that there are LOTS of paths in life that don’t involve MIT. Lots of really really good paths. Do you know how many alumni I’ve been employed with since graduating? 0. Do you know how many amazing and successful people I’ve worked with since graduating? A lot. A lot a lot. They went to schools like Purdue, Embry Riddle, Rose Hulman, Oregon State, Georgia Tech, Indiana University, and so on and so forth. And they’re doing great! And you will too.!#@p!#@=======!#@p!#@Ok, that’s the end of the heavy part. I think for the rest of this I’ll just post things that come to mind about my last few years of life.!#@p!#@Ok, I think that’s it. I mean, that’s not all of it, but that’s as much as I feel like writing right now.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-may-have-been-accepted-to-mit-but/
what i talk about when i talk about running by Chris S. '11,with apologies to murakami,by Chris S. '11,"January 21, 2025","“At the core of many of his stories was a distinction between success and excellence. Success was ‘having:’ money, awards, status. Excellence was ‘being:’ living your values, having them guide your daily life. Pursue excellence, Coach would say, and success will follow.” – Deena Castor, Let Your Mind Run!#@p!#@Last year, I ran just over 1200 miles. I have never hit that kind of mileage before. In Chinese, we say “people beyond people, horizons beyond horizons” (人外有人，天外有天) – this kind of mileage is still trump change among those who really run.!#@p!#@As the years go by, I see a lot of life reflected with each mile that goes by. I am not a bestselling novelist, but Murakami wrote an entire book about life and running, so I might be on to something?!#@p!#@HIGH SCHOOL!#@p!#@I started running during my freshman year. Honestly, I was not a great, or even a good, runner. I signed up for running mainly because I was not coordinated enough for team sports. Even though I am six feet tall, I always found basketball confusing (it is still, to this day). How are you supposed to know where to be on the court? How do you set up plays? Volleyball was better, but arbitrarily it was a women’s sport in our school, while the men did soccer.!#@p!#@So, I joined the track team.!#@p!#@My distances were 800 and 1500 meters. Later, I realized that this is where the coach put all of the people who weren’t naturally talented and weren’t “serious enough.” Putting folks like me in the middle distances freed up the shorter distances for the gifted sprinters, and us “amateur hobbyists” were less likely to get seriously discouraged or injured compared to training for the longer mile+ races. However, as anyone who did varsity track knows, the middle distances are HARD. 800 meters is sprinting 2 laps, the first lap at 80%, the second starting at 95% and ending at 110%. While I was quite mediocre – I never cracked a 6:30 mile in high school – I did enjoy the meets. My goal in all of HS track was to scrape by and qualify for the away meets, with traveling being the best part.!#@p!#@What track did teach me was discipline and mental visualization. When the racing got tough, I broke the track down into 100 meter segments. I soon learned from running hundreds of laps around our high school track that the first 100 meter curve has a slight incline, but then it’s quick dash down the straightaway for the next 100, followed by the second curve which usually involves running against some headwind. The last 100 was pure adrenaline, flying down the straightaway in front of the bleachers. 800 is 2 of these sets, 1500 is (almost) 4, rinse and repeat. When I was on the track and the pain is setting in, I always told myself, “If I could do this 100, I can do another 100.” Much later I learned that the famous running coach Jeff Galloway talks about the importance of having personal “mantra” in pushing yourself through the tough parts of a race – this is exactly it. Also, Winston Churchill paraphrased it well, “if you’re going through hell, keep going.”!#@p!#@“running running as fast as we can, do you think we will make it” – running, no doubt!#@p!#@I used to circle the track with this song on repeat in my brain. In high school, the future was uncertain. I went to high school in Taiwan. Which college was I going to land at in the US? I had a girlfriend then. We would probably break up, because that’s what happens, right?!#@p!#@(yes.)!#@p!#@MIT AND MED SCHOOL!#@p!#@I did not run much at MIT or in medical school in NYC (see the “I am not a great runner part”). I ran about once a month. However, the Charles River is so beautiful for running. Even Murakami talks about this in his book. I had a terrible sleeping schedule at MIT (I still do – unfortunately I am also now the father to 2 young children). I usually went to bed at sunrise, and got up sometime around lunchtime (looking back at it, how I got through undergrad missing the vast majority of my morning classes is remarkable). I loved doing a ~5 mile loop from New House, up the Charles River until I could see the Harvard brick buildings, cross the bridge, and then run back on the Boston side. It frustrated me to no end that I always crossed over the Charles on “Anderson Memorial Bridge.” I never understood why that couldn’t be called Harvard Bridge instead (since it led to Harvard Square!), and Harvard Bridge renamed MIT bridge. Heck, even Boston University has a janky bridge. Justice for MIT – equal bridge naming rights for all!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/boston-2-400x331.jpg]!#@Anyway, I used to time my run so that I would see the sun rise behind the Prudential Center on my way back on the Boston University Bridge. Sunrises over the Charles are so pretty (especially in the winter, but I saw the most sunrises in the summer when the sun rose earlier). The beautiful purplish-orange sunrises remain some of my fondest memory snapshots from college. My dorm (iHouse in New House) had a little terrace that overlooked the river, and I would often go out there right before I headed off to bed around 5-6 AM. Yes, I ran this loop mostly around 3-4 AM after wrapping up studying for the night. I used to tell people that I lived on Hawaii time at MIT, because my 5 AM bedtime was a very reasonable 11 PM or midnight bedtime…in Hawaii.!#@p!#@Then, I moved to NYC for med school. My dorm was on Madison Avenue just north of 96th in “East Harlem” ONE BLOCK from Central Park. Looking back, I severely underappreciated my proximity to this world-famous park. I usually entered the park on the East Meadow entrance, immediately north of the 97th St. traverse, link over to East Drive, and then proceed to run the 6 mile Central Park loop. Sticking to my bad habits, I often ran this at 10 PM. The doormen always looked at me curiously when I headed out in leggings and a running jacket, “Everyone is just coming back from studying, and you’re going running?” My roommate (a native New Yorker) informed me, more pragmatically, “You’re gonna get shot one day.” (Recognizing my male privilege), I am quite impressed at the number of runners in Central Park after midnight. I am never the only one, and I usually pass about a dozen or so on my loops around Manhattan.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nyc-3-400x430.jpg]!#@“if you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment. would you capture it, or just let it slip?” – eminem, lose yourself!#@p!#@This song summarized medical school. In the hypercompetitive environment of gunning for grades and a good residency, everything felt like the “one shot” or the “one opportunity.” It became my new mantra. With more years behind me, however, I now consider opportunity to be less important than the preparation to seize the moment. In Chinese, we say, “the stars align, the conditions are favorable, but most of all, the person is ready.” (天時地利人合) There’s another great quote, “the more I practice, the luckier I get.” You get the gist.!#@p!#@RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP!#@p!#@January 7, 2017 (NYRR Joe Kleinerman 10K) was the day when my “modern era” of running began. Residency was still in NYC with a few life updates. My then-girlfriend/now-wife Kathy ’10, moved from San Francisco to New York in 2015 to start her residency with mine, capping off 4 years of cross-country long distance dating after MIT. I moved out of my dorm to a 650-square foot 1-bedroom apartment, 8 blocks south, 3 blocks east.!#@p!#@After a year of living with me, Kathy noticed that I never exercised.!#@p!#@“You should get out more. How is it possible that you never need to exercise?”!#@p!#@“Meh.”!#@p!#@A few months pass.!#@p!#@“I’ve looked up these races in 2017. If we finish 9 of these races in one year, we get to run the NYC Marathon next year!“!#@p!#@“Okay.”!#@p!#@I joke to Kathy now that this is one of those watershed moments of your life where you look back on, and say, “Well, if I just never said anything that day…”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/468444649_10161297265387054_8739065642001119597_n-400x533.jpg]!#@That 10K was my first race in a very long time. Between high school and January 7, 2017, I half-sprinted, half-walked the NYC Half Marathon 2013 with Helen ’12 who came down to visit me from Harvard Medical School with absolutely no preparation (2:13). I said half-sprinted, half-walked, because I went out way too fast and spectacularly imploded after mile 10, walking the rest. It is quite remarkable that through my foolhardy approach I ended up injuring my left knee, with residual pain for months afterwards. To this day, my left knee is still wonky compared to my right.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/467853768_10161179696402054_2183299302802677036_n-2-400x533.jpg]!#@In 2017, I rediscovered the forgotten “runners high” that was the reinvigorating reward after the hard interval/tempo days of high school track. I quickly became addicted. I ran all of the longer races with Kathy, but couldn’t help letting loose at some of the shorter races. It was fun, and my times started dropping quickly. I ran my first marathon in New York, on 2018, just like Kathy and I had promised each other we would do. However, I did it solo because Kathy became pregnant before the marathon (and our first daughter was born a month after the marathon). We ran the 2019 NYC marathon together, dropping off our baby with one of our friends. Notably, I had a major cramp at Mile 24 and Kathy could have beat me by probably 20 minutes, but to her credit, she opted to stay behind and finish together.!#@p!#@We had the great foresight fortune to move out of NYC before the COVID era, and we landed in Ann Arbor in August 2019. Before Michigan, I never lived in a freestanding house. I spent my entire life in dorm rooms and apartments. I never saw any stars in the concrete jungle of NYC, but there were plenty of them in Michigan. Similarly, my running routes took on a distinctive rustic tone. 10 minutes after exiting our house and crossing the highway overpass, I would be running next to cows grazing in the field on the local farm road. Winter running was challenging, but I discovered I could tolerate down to about 15 degrees, when running became too extreme as I stopped feeling my face after 45 minutes. I tried to keep up the momentum, although 2020 was a challenging year for everyone. My favorite race in Michigan was the Capital City River Run out in Lansing. The course follows this beautiful woodland trail in Michigan’s capital city (I have a thing for capital cities). I ran it annually from 2019 to 2021, and I was very pleased with my 2021 time of 1:51 which was my half marathon PR for some time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/michigan-400x515.jpg]!#@“come on Eileen, oh i swear, at this moment, you mean everything” – come on eileen, dexys midnight runners!#@p!#@My favorite running memory happened at my third marathon at Chicago in 2021. Chicago is known for its fast course and it culminates with two straight miles on Michigan Avenue coming into Grant Park. Out of nowhere about a mile to the finish, I hear the strains of a fiddle, and a full-blown Irish folk band comes into view, striking up “Come on Eileen.” I will never forget the rush the build-up to the chorus gave me as I surged into Grant Park (almost getting a spectacular cramp right before the end).!#@p!#@“THE REAL LIFE”!#@p!#@We moved from Michigan to Seattle in mid-2022. We love it here. Yes, it rains a lot, but it does not rain nonstop in the winter (the locals say that to scare you away). We live on a hill fairly close to Puget Sound, so on my daily runs I can often spot the container ships heading out of Seattle into the Pacific. Seattle is very hilly, unlike every other city I’ve lived in. It makes for great running practice, but makes me hate life sometimes. I no longer run at night, but opt for the late afternoon (I still cannot get up early).!#@p!#@In 2023, I amped up from the 500-odd miles I’ve been running annually, incorporated some speedwork, and ended the year with about 750 miles. Addicted to the progress I’m making, I increased my annual mileage above 1000 in 2024.

If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that.

[Guest Post] A Whiff of Nostalgia Amidst the Scent of Youth by Ceri R. '16,by Daniel Barkowitz,by Ceri R. '16,"January 20, 2025","If I ever write my autobiography, I’m going to start it with this line: “I was born in a place that doesn’t exist anymore.” No, that doesn’t mean my homeland fell into the ocean, or was destroyed by the consequence of a natural disaster, but rather that the place of my birth has become an accident of human history. See, I was born in the Panama Canal Zone, at the time an American enclave filled with transplants from overseas living in and managing the transatlantic shipping crossing. My parents lived in the Canal Zone for 28 years and I was born about halfway during their stay which meant that when my dad retired, we moved to South Carolina (where they were from originally) and I left my community of friends behind.!#@p!#@I plan on going back to Panama this year. We are planning a trip to see the physical sites I grew up visiting daily – my elementary and middle school, the places we went for vacation (El Valle de Anton, Chiriqui Province), and the home where I used to live – but the people I knew are gone. The friends I made in school, the bowling league, the cub scouts, the swim team, the community theater people – they have all dispersed. While I can see the remnants of a life once lived, and I hold treasured memories, I can’t revisit or reconnect with the people themselves.!#@p!#@So why revisit? Why go back 40 years later? Why take the time to memorialize what came before? The answer, I think, is that it was an important part of my life, a time of growth and identity formation, and even though I can only see the skeletal remains, there is an honoring of what’s come before and the way in which they have shaped the person I have become.!#@p!#@In 2004, during my tenure as Director of Financial Aid at MIT, I learned about a project which was being undertaken by my colleagues in Admissions. Ben Jones and Matt McGann were introducing a revolutionary change to the Admissions website, and were going to feature staff and student bloggers. The idea was that there would be fresh content regularly rather than the static sites many schools used. I approached them and asked if I could be a part of this effort as a financial aid guy; I wanted to share information about how our process worked, sure, but also as importantly, I wanted to give applicants and the public an opportunity to get a view of the people who worked at MIT, to give you a chance to get to know us. From the beginning of the project until my time came to move on from MIT in 2009, I was part of the blogging crew.!#@p!#@You can’t find my older posts online now. Much of the content was relevant to the timeframe it was published and it really doesn’t make sense to have it public now (although if you are stealthy, you can search for it at the Wayback Machine or read my blogging mission statement at MIT Admissions | Blog Entry: “Feeling lost”). So, sure, much of what I wrote is not visible anymore; it doesn’t exist (see what I did there?). But the legacy lives on. The work that Ben, Matt, Anthony (’09), Bryan (’07), Jessie (’07), Jess (’10), Paul (’11), Mitra (’07), Sam (’07) and so many others contributed (and our current bloggers continue to contribute) represents the ongoing commitment to transparency and relevance that set the site apart from the very beginning. What an honor to have been a part of the initial crew, and what a great opportunity to revisit on our 20th anniversary.!#@p!#@So, what’s the legacy? How has the experience shaped me? I can say that for me personally the opportunity to reflect and share personal experiences in this format made me a better financial aid professional, and gave me a unique opportunity to interact with students and parents in a way I haven’t seen anywhere else. I miss it… And while I have tried to keep other blogs (looking at you Moneyman’s College Financial Aid Blog and Talking to Myself | Poetry from Now and Then) the impetus to stay updated with them just hasn’t been the same. I miss the community and the camaraderie of the MIT Blogs, and I do admire and envy the folks who still have the chance to share a glimpse of their lives and their process with you.!#@p!#@Maybe the popular adage really is true – “You can never go home again”. But here’s hoping you can at least visit on momentous occasions.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-a-whiff-of-nostalgia-amidst-the-scent-of-youth/

This is Jessie (they/them or she/her), class of 2007 and one of the earliest MIT Admissions bloggers. I lived on 5th East in East Campus and I majored in course 9 (Brain & Cognitive Sciences). I started blogging in the summer of 2005.!#@p!#@First of all, I’m running the Boston Marathon in April! I’m raising money for the National Organization for Rare Disorders. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome myself, which is something I didn’t know in college (you can actually read a little about how I learned at that link). My Linktree has a few links to my different donation incentives. It’s the first time I’ve run the Boston Marathon (or any marathon), but I’ve run the BAA Distance Medley (a 5K, a 10K, and a half-marathon, put on by the same organization that puts on the Marathon) for the past two years.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/857972_1247_0048-400x360.jpg]!#@For various reasons, I don’t want to specify exactly where I work, but I’ll say that it involves tech safety in the context of a human rights-related field, doing mostly national-level and some international work. I’ve gotten to advise government departments (both US ones and foreign delegations visiting through a Department of State program), tech companies, and the UN, all of which is pretty neat.!#@p!#@I ended up getting a PhD in computer science after a few post-MIT years of working in tech. I did a postdoc at Harvard, in computational public health. Then I decided that I didn’t really want to keep pursuing academia after all. I went into another field altogether, one that saw heightened need during the COVID-19 pandemic, while also learning and practicing digital security in my personal time. That combination of disparate fields led to my current job. It has nothing to do with my undergrad major, but it has everything to do with my attraction – which I had then – to interdisciplinary work.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/phd_student_age_28-400x600.jpg]!#@Outside of work, I’ve been busy, and not just with running. I make metal/glass/gemstone jewelry as a hobby, and I do a lot of activism. I learned a decent amount of Haitian Creole and have volunteered with newly-arrived migrant families. I’ve been a street medic – a first aid volunteer – at protests since 2011, and was on the scene providing first aid in 2017 when a neo-Nazi ran a car through a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. There was a famous photo of me in the news. I don’t want to post it directly here because it requires big content notes for terrorism and blood/injury, but you can find it at the top of a WDTV (CONTENT NOTE) article from August 12, 2017. My activism has taken me a lot of places: from Ferguson, Missouri, to Washington DC, to Tijuana, to the Southern Arizona deserts, to Palestine. I’m active in my local Democratic Socialists of America chapter, and in 2021 I did a community organizing fellowship with progressive Jewish organization JOIN for Justice.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/signal-2025-01-21-220014_002-400x400.jpeg]!#@I never talked much about Jewishness as a blogger, because I was in a period of my life where I assumed that “normal” Jews wouldn’t accept me. Children of intermarriage have become more and more accepted in Jewish communities, but we weren’t always. In the 17 and a half years since I graduated from college, this is something that has become an integral part of my life. I’m a member of the Boston Workers’ Circle, a left-leaning Jewish cultural center. Somewhat recently, I started volunteering with the food pantry at Jewish Family & Children’s Service (my favorite role is helping the “shopper” volunteers meet complicated combinations of medical and religious restrictions as they fill food bags for the clients). Anyone can receive food from this food pantry, but it’s the only one with kosher options that I know of locally, and my impression is that it’s unusually good at meeting medical food restrictions. A large number of clients are elders, including some Holocaust survivors. I’ve been learning Russian to be a more valuable volunteer, because a lot of people served by JF&CS are Russian speakers.!#@p!#@I’m a very different person than I was from 2005-2007. I’ve been married since 2010 and just became a homeowner. I’m older, wiser, and have been through a whole lot more (seriously, I’ve seen and been through some things). I know more about myself now (it would have been helpful, in college, to have known that I was autistic with ADHD, or that I had Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or that I was pretty seriously depressed). The concepts of genderqueerness/nonbinariness were only starting to be on the radar of people I knew. But there’s a pretty clear throughline between what I was then and what I am now.!#@p!#@I used to think that an MIT education doesn’t simply open doors – it teaches you how to find creative ways the other side. I thought that as a struggling 20-year-old. I still basically think it now. My intellectual interests are very, very different (and honestly, much deeper) than they were then. My work has nothing to do with my major. But I still think that MIT played a pretty big role in forming me into what I would be as an adult.

the blogs turn twenty 👴🏻 by Chris Peterson SM '13,the posts start coming and they don't stop coming,by Chris Peterson SM '13,"January 20, 2025","It is a venerable tradition of the blogs to begin a post by apologizing for being late, and whom am I to reject tradition? So let me first say that: the blogs actually turned twenty on August 6th, 2024.

Honestly, I do prefer the Boston fireworks I watched last year, but I think the friends do make it all worth it. Shoutout to the friends who spent new years with me <3!#@p!#@After the fireworks, four of us split off to hunt for burgers and poutine because why not. Great meal to start off the year with: indulgent and extremely unhealthy, but fun.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image27.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image35.png]!#@We also dragged ourselves up in the morning again to visit the Niagara falls.

I explored Toronto a little by myself today and had a DELICIOUS bowl of beef noodles. noodles were THICK and HANDMADE, beef was TENDER, the soup was FLAVORFUL. silky kitchen is sulking in the kitchen right now. also a great matcha latte from a different location of the same shop that Aileen took me to yesterday but the mug and the cold from yesterday made that one better I think!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image36.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image70.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image17.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image71.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image69.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image42.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image75.png]!#@I’m pretty sure this was the day where Dron’s parents COOKED. There was just a lot of good food that I didn’t have time to take photos of; if the family was a restaurant i think i would’ve probably ranked this first place. huge fan. I also haven’t really had Bengali cuisine before, and the flavour profile and base was so fresh! None of it was too spicy for me (thankfully), and I’m a huge fan of the aromatic base (onion, garlic and tumeric, if I recall correctly). The roast that lasted a few hours infused so much flavor into the mutton, and watching the meat fall apart at the fork was great. It was also really nice to have the cooking explained starting from a cultural basis; I learned more about Dron’s parents’ Bengali upbringings too, which really gives the food experience an unparalleled layer of depth. Parents (especially immigrants who have travelled between different cultural contexts) can seriously have the most interesting stories.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image38.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image14.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image49.png]!#@I also stayed over at Miranda’s (a fellow ‘27! <3) and she made this delicious crepe cake which basically rivalled Lady M’s (AND there was no added sugar, so +100 for helth). Miranda’s parents also made the best Chinese food I’ve had since leaving home so that was very heartwarming (and stomach warming… the FLAVORS i cannot explain it all in words)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image40.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image59.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image13-1-800x1163.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image29-400x533.png]!#@woke up to some of the best congee i’ve ever had. i think this congee had a chicken soup base because it was so rich, and it had the right amount of tanginess from fermented vegetables and ginger. there was also seaweed i think which gave it SUCH a good sense of umami. great dish but incredible given that it was breakfast for a chilly monday morning!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image72-400x533.png]!#@I actually didn’t like this tofu stew that much. I fear my palate was spoiled by the other good food I ate, but this tofu stew just didn’t have as much depth of flavour as I would’ve liked. Always a huge fan of barley tea though, and the side dishes definitely helped the light broth up a little.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image28-400x533.png]!#@This hot chocolate was good. I learned my lesson and stopped having caffeinated matcha lattes (no matter how good they are) in the afternoon ☠️also a huge fan of the ambience of this cafe, although maybe it was a little too cozy…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image55-800x1208.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image8-1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image58.png]!#@This is one of Miranda’s fav cafes! The menu looked suspiciously well designed to me, ⁠08 but the food was actually so good. I had this ochazuke which was very fun (you had to pour hot tea on it to cook the dish, by which I mean Miranda poured it because I was not sure how to pour it without burning myself). The flavours of this were much more well balanced. It was savoury and had the lightest hints of tea even though we poured the whole jug over it; there was also a sweetness that I couldn’t quite pinpoint. The rice also had a texture like congee rather than being soggy, which is great. For dessert we shared a mango sago; it was fruity and fresh, not much else to say.!#@p!#@After saying bye to Miranda and Laura (who came to visit) over some delicious bao buns, I went to visit the Royal Ontario Museum with Crystal! She had just landed from Panama, but I was very glad to have caught her. We had these mid parmesan fries and sweet pie, and I’ve decided that I enjoy custard and jam, and want something less sharp and more melty when it comes to cheese on fries.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image4-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image15-800x1067.png]!#@Dron joined us for dinner (sometimes it’s a very small world!) and we had an interesting experience at this Thai place — our conclusion at the end was that “the max rating of dishes across all three of us would be very good, and the min rating of the dishes across all three of us would be very bad.”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image61-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image56-800x1067.png]!#@my subjective personal rating (the other two differed based on personal preference):!#@p!#@tom yum soup!#@p!#@khao soi!#@p!#@rice mix!#@p!#@krad pa krao!#@p!#@For my tragically final day in Toronto, I masqueraded as a UofT ⁠09 student and tried out the dining halls! It was actually a really good experience. Huge fan of the dining hall and how pretty it looked, and the food was way cheaper than MIT’s, and also quite good (even if you had to pay for individual dishes and dessert seperately lol). The salad bar is pay by weight so that’s unfortunate, but I don’t think it’s priced too badly?⁠10 The food is also made in smaller portions compared to MIT, which I think makes for better seasoning control. The ingredient freshness is marginally better. Anyway, shoutout Toronto for keeping it real with all the good food and great company, and I will most definitely be back.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image24-800x429.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image73-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image5-1-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image63-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image37-800x1047.png]!#@When I landed in San Francisco, Devansh and Claire ⁠11 kindly picked me up and told me that we had to make a stop at In-N-Out. The burger was great; I didn’t actually like their fries (why are they so papery?) but overall a very good time, especially with some of the best yappers I know <3!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burger-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image74.png]!#@A group of our friends also hosted a cooking competition, except unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) we were only allowed to cook vegan dishes along with some other metrics. My team and I cooked a smashed cucumber salad (a favorite!), potato eggplant, and a peppers mushroom tofu stirfry. I like to think that the flavors were reasonably balanced, and the cucumber salad was especially fresh and bright, but we did marinate the eggplants in salt for a bit too long, and the stirfry did get a little cold. It’s fine, because the true prize were the friends we made along the way ⁠12 and also enjoyed some cakes (celebrated a few friends’ birthdays that day too)!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image67-400x513.png]!#@The sourdough was nicely toasted here; I didn’t like how the texture of the baked egg white almost congealed, and how the dish looked like it was swimming in oil. The flavours of the sausage and tomato base were good and I’m always a fan of a jammy yolk, so this was like a mid spinoff version (?) of a Shakshuka (don’t quote me on that one). Wouldn’t have again, but I don’t regret it.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image1-1-400x533.png]!#@I also made dinner with Helen W. ‘24 this day because I was crashing with her :’) we also bought some very yummy Trader Joes snacks. The snacks were to excuse our lateness to one of her friends’ board game nights, which was a very very wholesome house of board game nerds! We watched a scary game of Fish (which maybe wasn’t that scary, but I have an awful memory and so am terrified whenever Fish is played), and then played a game of Terraforming Mars. Helen and I almost won which is pretty cool considering that I was basically half-asleep the whole time (oops); I did actually enjoy the game a lot though, considering how it tickled my little monkey brain with all the shiny cubes and fun little gathering and counting up points that we were doing.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image16-400x533.png]!#@Had a typical more mid suburbia brunch on my last day in SF. None of this felt standout, it was all a little bland, and I didn’t really like the decision to deconstruct the burger (reconstructing it is MESSY. you’re supposed to give ME the satisfaction of taking it apart). However, the ingredients were reasonably fresh, we had some good chats over the food, and I didn’t pay for it so really I’m not complaining!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image68-400x533.png]!#@This week is hopefully somewhat more realistic for a week of my food habits in IAP, which also happens to be an exposure of how lazy I am when it comes to cooking!!#@p!#@once i landed, i’m pretty sure i just made instant noodles + kimchi once i landed. girl was a little exhausted from a painfully long flight what can i say!#@p!#@on the first proper day i was back, i woke up to go to trader joes and INDULGE. grocery stores are a guilty pleasure where i go in with no list and just let my inspiration take me. they had a full aisle of eggs (SF could never)!! can you imagine?? anyway i had a very joyous lunch where i tried the chicken soup dumplings which were pretty yummy, along with a grilled kimcheese (i know i’m an innovator with that name) and a jelly.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image20.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image10-1.png]!#@for dinner i made some instant noodles with MORE kimchi (yes i’m obsessed whatever) and fried up an egg and some trader joes pork dumplings. very good!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image2-1-400x533.png]!#@the next day, i went to trader joes for the second time in two days (obsessed what can i say) and fried up some scallion pancakes, dumpling and eggs for lunch and garnished with kimchi and mayo. oh and i forgot that i bought kimbap which was very yummy. i also noticed that i felt a little off (spoiler alert…) so i had an orange and randomly bought a probiotic pineapple juice shot!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image76.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image62.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image41.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image52.png]!#@for dinner i fried up some fish that had been in my freezer FOREVER,⁠13 stirfried some onion and egg, and also some potato and eggplant. had it with rice with friends Espen S. ’27 and Roshni P-M ’27. it was very good even if it took me two hours; peeling potatoes and reducing the water from the eggplant down is SO time intensive.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image6-400x533.png]!#@so something in the world didn’t want me going to trader joes a third time because i woke up today and felt SO off. i had some honey ginger tea and fried up some dumplings + egg + leftover eggplant & potato, and also had an orange; this unfortunately couldn’t save me as i proceeded to nap and wake up with an awful fever and massive headache.!#@p!#@i didn’t eat anything else that day because i was so exhausted but i drank a LOT of water (like three brita filters’ worth throughout the whole night). it was awful but seriously sleep and drink lots of fluid if you’re sick; i may have been absolutely knocked out, but since i had slept for like 20 hours intermittently and drank so much water, the next day my fever had already broken. locking in for recovery definitely helps.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image50.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image53.png]!#@so the fun life update was that…!#@p!#@i still felt fatigued today and certified that in fact yes i had caught The Flu, but i pulled together a lazy-ish meal because i knew i had to eat. you basically dice up an onion, and then throw it in some oil with a box of ground beef, box of tofu, and half a bag of peas (or whatever the pan will fit — i would’ve put more peas if i could). this is relatively quick to throw together (20 mins??) and tastes quite good. i had mine with rice for lunch and some of the last remaining potato eggplant stirfry for dinner (i made a lot what can i say). i also ate grapes that day because i feel like i have been underrating the value of fruit in my life.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image32.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image21.png]!#@today was surprisingly not slay all things considered; i couldn’t bring myself to do anything, so i proceeded to make my favourite comfort food (which is unfortunately a little higher effort): congee! i hate following recipes so i literally just filled up a pot with water, grabbed some scoops of rice (i couldn’t find a cup and i was too tired to ask around), threw the rice in when the water came to a boil, and then just sat around until the rice got mashed pretty easily by my spoon. i forget to track the time very often, so i really prefer heuristics-based cooking. i then literally just threw in some seaweed, corn, eggs that i beat up, and sesame oil and soy sauce and voila i have yummy congee. this may have been my only meal for the day but it was a good meal what can i say!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image77.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image43.png]!#@that brings us to today (the 19th)! i’m currently still kinda tired but i’m basically fully recovered, which is pretty cool. i just ate a bowl of my leftover congee mixed with my beef stirfry from two days ago, ⁠14 which is pretty good. this blog is gonna get out before dinner ⁠15 so you’ll never know what i have next i suppose!#@p!#@anyway, not quite sure what the moral of the story here is. i originally intended for this to just be a fun post where i flex all the yummy food i got to eat on rare occasion, but i guess i had to get karma’ed and expose myself for my more sus food consumption habits (especially when i’m sick and lazy and also don’t want to order food because it’s overpriced). ⁠16!#@p!#@hmmm maybe the moral is to GET YOUR FLU SHOTS KIDS IT’S FLU SEASON AND IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO PROTECT YOURSELF!! i fully admit that one reason i probably did get this sick was because i forgot to get the flu shot last year when MIT Health hosted free flu shots, and then proceeded to procrastinate and forget to get it again. i regret this a lot. i hope you don’t regret it the same way i did 👍 in freshman year i may have gotten quite sick a few times, but i did get the flu shot that year and then i think i at least got sick one less time during IAP than i counterfactually would have. please please please get all your vaccinations and things in order for both yourself and others; you’ll never know when it might come in handy to have a flu vaccination ☠️!#@p!#@also! i think a really important moral is that having kind friends is really cool because it means that even if you’re an international and going home is painful and arduous, you can still sometimes travel around and visit friends and have a really good time that way :) shoutout to everyone who kindly hosted me for so long!! especially Dron, Miranda and Crystal <3 huge fan of the canadians in my life who live up to the kindness stereotype!#@p!#@oh and final moral of the story is probably to not sign yourself up for a monster of a 5.3k word blog

Jill Biden waved at me by Aiden H. '28,D.C. during inauguration,by Aiden H. '28,"January 19, 2025","This IAP⁠01 I only took one class and it already finished, so I decided with the extra time that I would go visit my girlfriend in Washington D.C. It wasn’t until a couple days before leaving that I noticed that I would be in town for the second most important event⁠02 of the weekend: inauguration. Here’s a cluster of weird and very surreal moments that have happened while I’ve been here.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@Cut to the greatest dining experience of my life. We were walking around Georgetown shops and randomly decided to eat at a fancy restaurant (Brasserie Liberte, if you’re curious) because it sounded good despite our notable lack of fancy clothing and vibe. As soon as we walk into the entrance, two ominously tall workers in suits charged at us, holding us by the door and asking if they can search us. Confused, I said yes as one of the workers took my Barnes and Noble bag and searched through, asking, disappointedly, “Just books?” As much as I wanted to impulsively blurt something sarcastic like “Sorry I left the bombs at home :(“, I was too intimidated by the almost-definite weapons they had on them. I initially assumed this was all heightened security due to the election, but when shown to our table I noticed a line of security blocking off the backroom, and we officially decided someone important was in the restaurant. We did eat at a relatively weird time, but the restaurant was still very scarce, with us being one of four tables in the entire place, including the mystery guest. Considering it is D.C. and inauguration season, we weren’t entirely shocked that someone could be in the restaurant, but we couldn’t figure out who it could be. I threw out names of senators and political figures as I kept peeking my head back to see who it was. At one point I thought it was Liz Cheney because I saw a bright pink suit.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1173149023-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250117_171549-800x600.jpg]!#@Besides everything crazy that was happening throughout this experience, this food was genuinely crazy and totally worth it despite the minor manhandling at the door. They even gave us free French fries to apologize for “poor service”, which I think they did because all the workers were obviously on edge and constantly trying to act cool while sneaking glances towards the back of the restaurant.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1010207599-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-399468404-800x1067.jpg]!#@When our salad was brought out, a line of security started walking past us. An older lady at the table next to us stood up and started aggressively clapping, repeating the words “Thank You”. All of the other people in the restaurant looked up and noticed that it was not some congressperson, but quite literally the First Lady just casually walking right beside my table? As in less than a foot from me? She waved and smiled at everyone on the way out, and naturally it has been the only thing we’ve been talking about for days.!#@p!#@So I guess this is your sign to go to fancy restaurants for fun with friends, and maybe something cool will happen?!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@The next day I visited Old Town Alexandria, which is slightly Boston-core in the way that it is all very brick and has a lot of historical features, albeit these were more educational as they were focused on Virginia’s role in the slave trade and not the superfluous patriotism of dumping tea in water, but I guess I digress. Old Town was a lot busier than normal because of the inauguration tourism, which I completely forgot about until I saw this:!#@p!#@Personally? A little deflating. In general? The funniest thing I’ve ever stumbled upon. Looks like Jill was waving goodbye in more ways than one.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@Cut to a very different dining experience. Tonight we went to a Lebanese restaurant in downtown/Penn Court. We took the metro from GW to Metro Center and were immediately reminded that tonight was the night before inauguration. In the three block walk to the restaurant, we had to walk through barricades in streets, have police officers usher us across sidewalks and around rallies, and turn down stands selling Trump merchandise.!#@p!#@The meal was perfect because the restaurant was peak ambiance and Lebanese/Mediterranean food is my favorite, but the entire experience felt like an event in and of itself, when we were just trying to eat? The police cars barricading off streets had their lights on, with every window becoming emblazed. with red and blue. Out of the window by our table I could see both pro and anti-Trump protestors surrounded by barricades and security, covered in light. This was all outside of the MLK Memorial Library with a man on a Jumbotron-esque screen asking if I had spread the word of Jesus recently. Everyone around us at the restaurant was discussing their plans now that the inauguration had been moved inside, and it took me a noticeable and important effort to check myself in public, to recognize that the color of a sweatshirt should not cause me to hate people sitting next other than me in a random restaurant. Something I hate in democracy is when one side loses, they suddenly don’t support democracy? This, as we probably all know, has happened on a large scale in recent years, but I think everyone is guilty of this and it peeves me to no end. Why was I allowing myself to get upset that people were exercising democracy by celebrating an open election? Shouldn’t I be glad that thousands of people want to partake in the free process of swearing in our next democratic leader? Am I nothing more than a hypocrite who would be in the masses I was watching with disgust from the restaurant? This is a common thought process I like to walk myself through, but in light of the most recent election not matching my personal political views, it has become something I find important, especially when I was surrounded by the very thick of it during my time here in D.C.!#@p!#@In the visual onslaught of Trump paraphernalia I was exposed to, I decided to test my own limits on the way back with some photos of my own. Despite the photos and the shirt being (hopefully) obviously ironic and satirical, even if a little true, I was still heckled and yelled by visiting tourists for wearing a shirt they disagree with even though I very much did not yell at theirs. It doesn’t matter though, because I find these very rodent-core photos of me not trying to freeze a hilarious way to enter the events of tomorrow.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-283346166-800x1437.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1596587128-800x899.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1173149023-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250117_171549-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1010207599-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-399468404-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-283346166-800x1437.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Snapchat-1596587128-800x899.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/jill-biden-waved-at-me/
Guess who can legally drive alone in Maine now? by Andi Q. '25,"Learning to drive on hard mode (i.e., in Boston)",by Andi Q. '25,"January 19, 2025","Last Thanksgiving break, a few of my friends and I visited Acadia National Park in Maine. We planned meticulously for the trip – booking the Airbnb months in advance, creating an itinerary of trails to hike, and even planning each meal down to the ingredient – until one big question remained: Who would do the grueling five-hour drive from Boston to Maine?!#@p!#@Everyone was understandably reluctant to drive, so I volunteered. After all, I’ve had my South African driver’s license for three years and was no stranger to driving long distances back home. Immediately, however, my friends objected.!#@p!#@“Don’t people drive on the left side of the street in South Africa?”!#@p!#@“Andi, this is Boston traffic we’re talking about. Aren’t you the least bit terrified?”!#@p!#@“Is it even legal for you to drive here?”!#@p!#@My friends were right about the first two things, but I assured them I’d practice before the trip and drive extra carefully (and slowly) while we were still in Boston. To their third objection, I smugly pointed out that Massachusetts (like most US states) allows driving with a foreign license printed in English.!#@p!#@“Yeah, but what about the states that don’t?”!#@p!#@To my dismay, a Google search revealed that Maine only allows driving with a foreign license only if I’ve been in the country for less than a month. But I wasn’t about to let anything get in the way of my Acadia trip.!#@p!#@“What if… I just got a US driver’s license?”!#@p!#@“Right now?”!#@p!#@“Right now.”!#@p!#@For the last three years, I’d always put off getting a US license for several reasons, such as:!#@p!#@But this year, I finally ran out of excuses, and this Thanksgiving trip was the catalyst I needed to get started on the process. My fall semester classes perfectly aligned such that I had a permanent 5-day weekend, and I realized I could pay a driving school to use their car for the road test. A US license (with REAL ID) also comes with many perks, like being able to travel between states without having to carry my passport and risk losing it. I was going to live in New York City after graduation too; as terrifying as driving in Boston is, I felt that doing my road test in Manhattan would be much worse.!#@p!#@With that, I hatched up my ingenious three-step plan:!#@p!#@Foolproof if you ask me.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, nothing involving the RMV is ever that simple. Despite having three years of driving experience, I still needed to get a learner’s permit before doing my road test.!#@p!#@No worries though – I knew how to drive and what all the street signs meant (even though they’re different from the rest of the world for some reason), and after reading through the Massachusetts Driver’s Manual, I could ace all the online mock tests I took. Plus, I was allowed to get a generous seven of the 25 questions wrong and still pass.!#@p!#@With the confidence of a Bostonian driver running a red light, I marched into the exam room, expecting to breeze through the test. However, I quickly learned that the online mock tests I used had left out a rather big portion of the actual test: laws about the Junior Operator Licence (the license you get if you’re under 18). I only briefly skimmed the JOL part of the driver’s manual because none of those laws apply to me anymore so I assumed the test would have at most two questions about it, but my test had at least five. And of course, I got all of those questions wrong.!#@p!#@In the end, I barely scraped by with just enough correct answers to pass. But a pass is a pass! The Thanksgiving trip was only a week away at this point, so it was too late for me to do the road test and get the proper license. Still, I could finally drive to Maine (as long as someone with a valid license accompanied me)!!#@p!#@Despite having a shiny new learner’s permit in hand, I didn’t end up driving to Maine. One of my friends, an EMT who drives the MIT ambulance, joined the trip and volunteered to drive instead. (Probably for the better, because she’s very good at driving – much better than me.) I still got in some good driving practice in Boston and parallel parking practice in Maine, so I scheduled my road test after returning from the trip.!#@p!#@As you can probably tell by the timing of this post though, I did not blow away the examiner with my impeccable driving skills. In fact, the test went so poorly that I didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. It was kind of embarrassing, especially given that the South African road test is objectively way harder (e.g., we have to do it in a manual transmission car) and I was able to pass that test as a teenager.!#@p!#@Anyway, I took that first road test as a sign that I needed much more practice, so I signed up for a few driving lessons before retaking the road test. Honestly, I really needed those lessons. If driving in Johannesburg is middle school, then driving in Boston is MIT. The roads here are so much more chaotic, and there are so many more hazards that I never had to deal with back home.!#@p!#@Firstly, there’s the weather. The temperature almost always stays above freezing in Johannesburg, and winters there are dry, so the roads are never icy there. In contrast, Boston was covered in black ice this morning because it rained last night.!#@p!#@Next, there are pedestrians. Johannesburg is a very car-centric city with a surprising lack of sidewalks, so there are few pedestrians and even fewer jaywalkers. In contrast, pedestrians and jaywalkers are everywhere in Boston. One time, someone walking her dog even saw me slowly rolling down the street and decided to run onto the street in front of me.!#@p!#@Finally, there’s Boston’s awful road system. People complain a lot about Boston drivers being dangerous, but after driving around Boston for a week, I can say it’s less a driver skill issue than an issue of the roads being near impossible to navigate. Not only are many of them missing road markings (so it’s hard to tell where you’re meant to go), but their layouts and designs are confusing and often misleading. Several times, the lane I was in seemed to end abruptly and become parking lanes with no warning, and there’s even this one street in Chinatown with a one-way sign pointing in the wrong direction. I got yelled at during my road test this morning for straddling lanes, even though the markings indicated only a single lane. And don’t even get me started on how narrow the lanes are. Awful. Truly just awful.!#@p!#@My driving instructor and prior driving experience made these lessons go rather smoothly, but still, there were more near misses than I’m proud to admit. I’m amazed that bus drivers can drive around Boston all day without causing massive car crashes.!#@p!#@After all that I’d gone through in the past week, retaking the road test felt very anticlimactic. I’d scheduled my test for a Sunday in the winter at 7 AM, so there were almost no pedestrians or other traffic on the roads. I just had to drive around the block, do some maneuvers, and return to the parking lot; all was said and done within 10 minutes. “Eh, good enough” was the only feedback the examiner gave me after the test.!#@p!#@Despite the lack of fanfare, my brain was on a dopamine high the whole time as I biked back to MIT. As anticlimactic as it was, passing this mundane little test that most people pass on their first try as teenagers felt like one of my biggest achievements at MIT. Because finally, I can legally drive alone in Maine now!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guess-who-can-legally-drive-alone-in-maine-now/
Reporting from… Doha! 🐫🐫 by Fiona L. '27,ft: the first time I ever rode on a camel,by Fiona L. '27,"January 18, 2025","This winter, before arriving at my GTL⁠01 in Kazakhstan, I decided to visit Doha, Qatar, with Jade B ’26, a friend also going to Kazakhstan for GTL. Doha was the most common layover when traveling to Kazakhstan, and we thought the weather would be very pleasant at this time of year. 02 In addition, Qatar Airways offers a “stopover program,” for multi-day layovers with free/heavily discounted hotel bookings in Doha.!#@p!#@Here’s a recount of my adventure! Hopefully, this will be the start to a fruitful series of Fiona Travel Blogs.!#@p!#@I arrived at Hamad International Airport with Jade, 03 and made it through customs, where I got the first stamp on my brand new passport! Afterwards, we checked into our hotel and dropped off our luggage. We decided that our first destination would be Souq Waqif, a Qatari marketplace. On the outskirts, it felt similar to a fancy/quirky mall, but there was a part on the inside that looked historic, as if it had been preserved for many years, with only the exterior changing with time. I got a fridge magnet to add to my ever growing collection, and we saw arrays of spices, golden camel charms, and fake designer bags.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_22-06-29_918-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-31-38_233-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-11-30_724-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-15-33_666-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-25-05_310-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@We ate dinner at “The Village,” a restaurant that served both Middle Eastern and Indian cuisine, then went back to the hotel to collapse in our beds⁠04 .!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-07-17_339-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-11-08_413-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-11-10_929-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@While we were waiting to be checked in, I watched the TV in the lobby. A woman reached into the desert to pick up a rock formation, the sand falling in streams over her palms, revealing the rock formation she had found: a collection of round intersecting spines, all the same beige-yellow as the desert sand. The spines intersected in a way that resembled the rock’s namesake: the desert rose.!#@p!#@Our only full day in Doha! We started off the day by eating lunch at Saasna, a restaurant that had been recommended in a travel guide in our hotel.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_14-24-37_733-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_13-48-38_271-800x1067.jpg]!#@Afterwards, we walked to the Museum of Islamic Art Park, then caught a taxi in time to watch the sunset at Pearl Island, a small artificial island north of the main city. Along the way, we passed by a beautiful mosque and saw dhows, a type of traditional Qatari boat. Pearl Island was beautiful at sunset, filled with multi-colored Western-style apartments and hotels. Come nighttime, we got to see the Corniche, a street lined with Doha’s most interestingly-shaped skyscrapers, lit up with every color of the rainbow.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-16-14_296-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-26-21_929-800x1067.jpg]!#@Then, we took a taxi to Katara Cultural Village and had dinner⁠05 at “Tasty Street”.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-52-30_559-400x533.jpg]!#@At night, we booked a tour where we went “dune bashing”: basically, we went in a jeep/offroad type car whose wheels were deflated to drive on the sand. The sand was so bumpy! I got some slight motion sickness, but the excitement of the whole thing kept me from becoming very very sick. We also had a short camel ride. Although I was almost falling asleep at that point, I seemed to gain a new sense of vigor when I saw the camp full of camels, all with saddles on their humps. The ride was very wiggly, and right after getting on the camel was the hardest part, since the camels would always lift their hind legs first, making me feel like I was going to fall sharply forward. There was a guide who led both the camels by ropes, and the whole ride was only 5-10 minutes, with us only walking a little ways outside the camp. But overall, Jade and I were pretty excited the whole time. “I can’t believe we’re riding on camels right now!” we said through our exchanged glances (and through words).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_20-55-59_666-400x533.jpg]!#@The tour concluded with seeing the Inland Sea, a lake in the middle of the desert, that looked absolutely beautiful under the stars. I wondered how surprised the first person to discover the Inland Sea must have been. A sea, appearing without explanation, in the middle of a vast desert–how surprising was that?!#@p!#@We then drove to the ocean and the tour guide pointed out some lights on the other side of the water. “That’s Saudi Arabia,” he said, to my awe and amazement.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_22-17-45_296-400x533.jpg]!#@Last day in Qatar! We ate lunch at the Museum of Islamic Art Cafe, which presented a stunning view of The Corniche during the day. Then, we checked out the museum, which was filled with different types of art from around the world, all sorted into a bunch of galleries by region. Fun fact, the exterior of the museum was actually designed by I.M.

Desert roses, or gypsum roses, were a source of fascination to me ever since I first saw the video in the hotel. I wanted nothing more than to hold one in my own hand, a phenomenon that I thought too carefully calculated to have been produced by nature. I noticed that every single desert rose in the gift shop was unique, 06 and I picked one to my liking to join me on the next leg of my adventure.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_17-33-34_424-10-400x533.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_22-06-29_918-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-31-38_233-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-11-30_724-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-15-33_666-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_20-25-05_310-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-07-17_339-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-11-08_413-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-02_21-11-10_929-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_14-24-37_733-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_13-48-38_271-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-16-14_296-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-26-21_929-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_17-52-30_559-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_20-55-59_666-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-03_22-17-45_296-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_13-08-46_536-7-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_15-26-33_216-11-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_16-11-13_130-11-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_16-50-33_053-7-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_17-07-59_716-6-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-04_17-33-34_424-10-400x533.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/reporting-from-doha/
[Guest Post] Getting Help @ MIT by Jeremy W.,by Warren K. ’27,by Jeremy W.,"January 17, 2025","In my first month at MIT, I:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WK_Picture1.jpg]!#@After 12 years in the service, I got out of the Navy in August and started at MIT in September. I knew that this transition would be challenging. Juggling all of this and what I’ll call “normal adult things”—making a budget and paying bills, doing chores, taking care of myself, etc.—was a little overwhelming.!#@p!#@So when I felt like I was drowning, I asked for help. Asking for help can be a little scary. I think it’s especially hard at MIT because it means being vulnerable and admitting that you’re failing a little… and folks here aren’t used to failing. The biggest highlight of my first month here was experiencing how much MIT prioritizes supporting students.!#@p!#@Something I wish someone would have told me from the start is: you can’t even imagine the kind of support you’ll get. You don’t need to know what to ask for. You just need to reach out.!#@p!#@I didn’t start out knowing who to talk to or what to ask for. I started by asking one person… and they knew people in offices I didn’t know existed. MIT has offices full of people who spend their days listening and thinking of innovative ways to support the people here. The most critical piece of help that I got was someone listening to me and reminding me that I am capable of handling everything (thanks Justin!).!#@p!#@In my first month at MIT, I got help from:!#@p!#@This didn’t happen all at once. It started with an email to my academic advisor, then a phone call, then a couple of meetings (virtual and in-person) with some of these offices. Before I knew it, people I didn’t know existed were helping me solve my problems in ways I didn’t know they could be solved. For some offices, I just showed up and people either helped me right then or pointed me in the right direction.!#@p!#@I just finished my first semester. I didn’t struggle to complete any of my classes. All of the problems I listed earlier are resolved (except my car, which is fixed; I’m picking it up from the shop right after break). I’m looking forward to visiting my family during the break. When I return to MIT next semester, I’ll be doing it knowing something I didn’t know before: having a bad start to a semester doesn’t mean I’ll have a bad ending.!#@p!#@If I need help, all I have to do is ask.!#@p!#@Hi everybody, I’m Warren! I moved to Cambridge from Hawaii, one of the several places I was stationed during my 12+ years in the U.S. Navy. On my route to transferring to MIT in September 2024, I attended a small liberal arts college, a large flagship state university, a couple of community colleges and some Navy schools. At MIT I’m planning on double-majoring in 6-2 and 4-B, but I’m also interested in a bunch of classes in courses 2, 11, 15, and 22.!#@p!#@I graduated from high school in Memphis, TN and grew up in the South. On campus you can find me creating stuff in one of MIT’s many makerspaces or waiting in line at Bosworth’s for a warm drink (Bosworth’s exists in the 4th dimension and fits into ANY walking route through campus). This year I learned that rivers can freeze and that molasses is a deadly substance that can kill people.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WK_Picture1.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-getting-help-mit/
"Final projects from the fall by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",three coding projects and an alien in disguise,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","January 16, 2025","I had four final projects this past semester. As busy as I was for the last several weeks of the semester, I was so relieved that I didn’t have exams. I love making things, and I hate exams.!#@p!#@Final report!#@p!#@I only took this class because the course ratings were high, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes that I’ve taken. We learned how to create image-editing effects in C++ that would normally take much longer to replicate manually in Photoshop.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mars_planet.png]!#@We were given a list of options to choose from for our final project.

Although more rigorous than I expected, I really enjoyed doing the assignments and felt like I improved as a storyteller by the end.!#@p!#@Whether I actually improved or not is up for debate. I couldn’t decide what to write about for my final project, so I took a theory I have about Tom Cruise and wrote a 20-page script based on it. The final script is about an alien who crash-landed on Earth, and disguised himself as a Hollywood actor so he could get rich enough to buy a spaceship and return to his home planet. My professor had to read the whole thing with his own eyeballs.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-15-at-10.13.22-PM-400x191.png]!#@What matters is that I had fun.

2.009: the product engineering process by Emiko P. '25,the best class at mit,by Emiko P. '25,"January 16, 2025","For some schools, the biggest events of the year are rambunctious homecoming weekends and rivalry football games broadcasted on ESPN. At MIT, though, nothing beats the energy and celebration of the 2.009 Prototype Launch – the biggest party of the year. Equipped with enough fanfare to welcome the Queen of England, including a DJ, acapella groups, dance teams, and ridiculous amounts of confetti, this event is a must-see for any MIT student.!#@p!#@The 2.009 Prototype Launch is the final presentation for one of the most famous classes at MIT – 2.009: the Product Engineering Process. It’s a capstone class for Mechanical Engineering seniors, where the students are broken up into six teams of about 15 people each, and you have 12 weeks to create a prototype and present it to a live audience of over 1000 people.!#@p!#@How the final presentation itself went is pretty well covered in this liveblog by Janet and Kayode, and you can watch the livestream itself here, so I will focus more on the 2.009 experience as a student and walk you all through my team’s process throughout the semester.!#@p!#@Let’s start with my team: the Red Team. Somehow fate took all the smartest, funniest, and coolest people ever and put them all on this team. Your experience in 2.009 can depend a lot on your team, so I feel super lucky with how it worked out for me.!#@p!#@We had just 12 weeks to go from learning each other’s names to presenting our product, the world’s first ever powered respirator for wildland firefighters, in MIT’s biggest auditorium. Come and see how we did it.!#@p!#@Getting 17 people on the same page is not an easy feat, which became immediately clear after Red Team’s very first meeting. We were tasked with coming up with six “opportunity spaces,” which we would be pitching to our entire class later that week.!#@p!#@As we were coming up with ideas in our brainstorming session, things were steadily getting more tense between the team. What the heck is an “opportunity” anyway? We began to bicker, as we all had different definitions for what we were supposed to be working on. Is an “opportunity” broad (ex: Fires) or specific (ex: Fires caused by lithium ion batteries in landfills)? It goes to show how important being on the same page would be for our team.!#@p!#@Not going to lie, I was a bit nervous leaving that first meeting. What if the semester would be fraught with drama? I was already getting the sense that the social and personal aspect of the class would be just as important as the actual engineering.!#@p!#@We regrouped a day later, with a fresh slate and with a definition for what would actually constitute an opportunity (which turned out to be somewhere in the middle of broad and specific, for example: Fires in landfills), and from that point on, we learned to manage and communicate any conflicts without nearly as much tension and frustration as that first meeting.!#@p!#@It was from that moment on that The Red Team started becoming a powerhouse.⁠01!#@p!#@Later that week, we presented our six opportunities, which ranged from railway safety to food waste management to containing forest fires.!#@p!#@Taking inspiration from the six opportunities, we narrowed down our pool to four different ideas. First, we had to identify the Killer Question, aka what is the one thing that would kill our product’s viability. Second, we had to build a model demonstrating an answer to this Killer Question, which could either be a technical model (some code and math demonstrating that a product would work) or a physical model.!#@p!#@Our four ideas included an urban sapling hydration system, a dysautonomia exercise aid, a geothermal drilling noise mitigation device, and a wildland firefighting mask (which is the one we ended up going with). Just to show you guys an example, the Killer Question for the wildland firefighting mask was: Can we provide both sufficient filtration and breathability? Wearing something like an N95 mask is uncomfortable on its own – now imagine wearing a mask while running a marathon, wearing at least 40 pounds of gear, and being surrounded by an out-of-control wildfire. A product like this would not be viable.!#@p!#@Our answer to this killer question was this: A battery-powered system that allows for high filtration without sacrificing the breathability and comfort of the user. We created a model to show that this solution was feasible, by doing a power calculation as well as an airflow calculation to show that it was possible to assist airflow enough to ease the comfort of the user while also using a reasonable number of batteries.!#@p!#@Fun team bonding! This was a challenge where each team would be racing to complete an obstacle course. The goal was to transport 100 water balloons to the end of the course using mechanisms we had built in lab earlier that week. I’ve never screamed and laughed so hard – especially when our first mechanism immediately failed and we were forced to bypass the first obstacle by frantically jumping in a potato sack. Pink team won the challenge this year! And you can only imagine what happened after the challenge was over… It’s not like we were going to let six hundred water balloons go to waste.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mit-color-800x597.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/team-spirit-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/water-balloon-800x533.jpeg]!#@We down selected from our four ideas and went forward with the Wildland Firefighting Respirator. Wildland firefighters are an interesting user group because, unlike firefighters who put out fires inside of buildings, wildland firefighters rarely wear masks out in the field. And if they do, it’s usually just a bandana soaked in water. The brave firefighters defending our homes and land deserve a safer solution – an issue that has unfortunately become even more dire due to the recent wildfires ripping through LA. With not a single powered respirator for wildland firefighters existing on the market, we decided we would create the first.!#@p!#@The Concept Review was basically an elevator pitch of our concept: a battery-powered wildland firefighter respirator with a focus on comfort and safety. At this point, we were doing as many user interviews as possible by building our contacts within the wildland firefighter community. These interviews helped us pinpoint features that would make them want to wear our respirator versus what would drive them away.!#@p!#@We were halfway through the semester! By this point, we had made some key progress, including:!#@p!#@During Architecture Review, we presented our progress, answered questions from professors, defended our design decisions, and breathed a sigh of relief that it all went smoothly. Then, we got ready to take a much needed break – SIKE!!! Only six weeks until product launch (one of these weeks being Thanksgiving break) and you think we’re taking a break??? No way.!#@p!#@We continued iterating on our product based off of the advice given to us during Architecture Review. After three weeks of hard work, we finally had our first functioning prototype of Vortex. During Technical Review, we demonstrated the prototype to our professors in our manufacturing lab, Pappalardo, where they gave us some final feedback for our product.!#@p!#@And with that, we had only a few weeks to integrate all these changes and build not one, but two, final prototypes for the Final Presentation. The team put in so many hours during this final sprint, and there was always someone to be found downstairs in the lab. We were machining, sewing, assembling, soldering, setting things on fire, and praying that everything went smoothly. Miraculously, this hard work paid off and we had our final prototypes done two days before the Final Presentation. The feeling of seeing the final product can only be described as exhilarating.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/final-demo-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/on-fire-800x1067.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/brainstorm-800x533.jpeg]!#@Peeking behind the towering curtains of MIT’s biggest stage, all you could see was an undulating, feral crowd of nerds waving rainbow pom poms and cheering at the top of their lungs.!#@p!#@The day had finally arrived.!#@p!#@It was time to present Vortex, our powered respirator for wildland firefighters. Our three presenters stepped onstage to the sound of deafening applause, and the rest of the team stood backstage, watching with bated breath.!#@p!#@The crowd cheered as we demonstrated the features of our product, and when we announced that Vortex was capable of filtering air to be 200x cleaner,⁠02 the applause was thunderous.!#@p!#@The Prototype Launch was an awesome experience. I remember watching these presentations every year for the past three years and thinking, How in the world did they make that in a semester? Now I know.!#@p!#@The design process has a bunch of phases, as you can tell from the breakdown of the weeks I just outlined. One of my favorite phases was the ideation phase. The brainstorming meetings with the team were awesome – especially when an idea pitched by one team member would snowball, collecting ideas and feedback from the rest of the team, and turn into a really exciting prospect.!#@p!#@Although the development process was a grind and probably the most frustrating part for me personally, it was so rewarding that it was also one of my favorite phases of the design process. I was on the Manufacturing Team with two other team members, and we were responsible for figuring out what materials our product was going to be made out of and how. We played around with composites, 3D printing, and molding. For the final product, I was working on the lathe to machine the cap to our filter and was working on other miscellaneous integration steps that had to be done to assemble our many parts together. I think one of my favorite days of the entire semester was when we finished integrating the final product just as the cleanup music in the lab started playing at 9 pm. 5 minutes later, we were all kicked out of lab, but we had beautiful pictures of our final product, and in our Slack channel, everyone was basking in the glory of our hard work.!#@p!#@Something else I learned is that the design process is not perfect. You don’t just stumble upon a gold mine of an idea. You have to research. You have to talk to as many users as possible. You have to be willing to pivot if you learn that your idea is already patented, physically impossible, or nobody’s going to use it. You have to keep trying and iterating and building. And maybe most importantly of all, you have to work as a team.!#@p!#@The Red Team was awesome throughout this whole process. We kept each other accountable but also were willing to hold out a hand when people were falling behind or needed help. Vortex is the result of 17 brains coming together and transforming an idea into a product, creating the world’s first ever battery-powered mask for wildland firefighters. This project was so fun!!!#@p!#@Thank you to the amazing staff of 2.009, especially the instructors and the Pappalardo shop crew, and congrats to the Red, Yellow, Purple, Pink, Blue, and Green Teams on designing some super sick products. I’m excited to see where this class of Mechanical Engineers goes :)!#@p!#@And with that, we wrap up a semester of 2.009 and a semester of Breathing Easy and Battling Hard with Vortex.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mit-color-800x597.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/team-spirit-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/water-balloon-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/final-demo-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/on-fire-800x1067.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/brainstorm-800x533.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/2-009-the-product-engineering-process/

Unlike my research supervisor (Hans), I didn’t know how to ski, so I ended up slowing him down a whole lot. Skate skis are a lot easier to learn since they’re similar to ice skating where you push to the side, but it was also a lot more annoying in the beginning because it felt like I was wearing very long clown shoes.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-14-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-18-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-11-800x600.jpg]!#@Hans was not anticipating winter activities and ended up cross country skiing with a coat over his formalwear, so I couldn’t really pelt him with snowballs. The trails themselves were quite fun with a lot of uphill and downhill sections. We started with a couple wrong turns, but managed to get back in time within the last hour. At the end, after poking several trees and falling  several times, I walked back into the ski rental lodge lobby with snow in my boots and icicles in my hair, grinning as I lied about getting the hang of things. I don’t think I wiped out as bad as Andi did, but I was flopping around quite a bit in the beginning.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-7-400x400.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-8-400x400.jpg]!#@Indoor Time!#@p!#@When we were waiting for hotel check in to start, I got to see my grad student friends (Daniel and Ben) getting worked like hounds to finish an IC (integrated circuit) tape out before the deadline which just so happened to be the first day of MARC. While Hans took a nap and I wandered around the basement, the two posted up in the business room with their eyes glued to their laptops. I think they went straight to sleep after they finished. During one of the social hours, I found a bunch of my fellow undergrads, many of whom were here to present their final projects from the nano fabrication class (6.254). We quickly became friends from talking throughout the day.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-4-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-19-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-10-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-5-800x600.jpg]!#@At dinner, our table name for trivia was “The Kids Table (+Hans) (+Dohyun)”. While Andi seemed to be diligently take notes on the panel happening afterwards, I went back to my room to take a fat nap, having only gotten 4 hours of sleep the previous night. I hauled my butt up in time for the group photo, but I’m pretty sure I sneezed as the camera flashed the first time.!#@p!#@I played poker with Kat in the evening. Through her prowess in social deception, a keen eye, and a pure skill, Kat ended up with the dragon’s hoard of wealth by the end of the game.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-3-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-20-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@Nope, just kidding. None of us knew how to play poker so we all got kicked to the noob table. We didn’t really get to bluff or anything since we were all showing our hands to the dealer and he would tell us out loud “you can still stay in the game, put 200 in”, or “you got a crap load of nothin’!” And tell us to fold. He took pity on the losers and tossed us extra chips to keep playing if we ran low. For the last round, everyone went all in, and Kat won the whole pot with all 4 aces.!#@p!#@We roasted marshmallows in the fire pit outside until we all got too cold. As we were walking back to our hotel rooms, I was giving out some terrible advice as a joke and was heard very clearly and very out of context by Dohyun when he passed us in the hall. I think what we said is a little heinous for the blogs, judging by the expression he had on his face.!#@p!#@Day 2: Pitches and Posters!#@p!#@I only managed to sit through about 10 minutes of the keynote speakers before deciding it was far more interesting to go frolic in the snow. I don’t particularly enjoy listening to talks about AI or startups, but that’s just me.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-17-400x533.jpg]!#@I didn’t do the pitch because I wasn’t too sure on what the vibes were when the signups opened, but it was a lot more casual than I expected. Each pitch is 60 seconds long, and they honk a rubber chicken at you if you go overtime. The ones presented were all interesting, with some people cracking jokes and even singing. Some of my friends did a pitch together about the supercapacitor they made for their final project in the nano fab class and did an amazing job with the energy they brought on stage. Everyone voted for their favorite pitches, and they were one of five groups that won! I’m fairly certain people all voted for the pitches with the most whimsy.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-21.jpg]!#@I made up for the lack of public speaking with the poster session, because I got absolutely GRILLED. People were asking me question after question, and I could barely run away from my spot to look at other people’s research. I had to dig the depths of my brain to find details from papers I read months ago, and awkwardly point them to my references section whenever I wasn’t confident about what I said. I wasn’t sure whether I got so much interaction because people were genuinely interested in my research, or because I explained it in a confusing enough manner that people were just looking for clarification.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-15-400x533.jpg]!#@Yapping about magnetic resonance for an hour straight took a lot out of me, but I was free to look at everyone else’s groundbreaking research afterwards in everything from Lidar photonics to mini somersaulting robots. I got to talk to one researcher who was working 3D printed magnets, but was limited by the size and strength of the electromagnet used to magnetize them. Naturally, I offered to let her use the 6000 pound elevator-sinking electromagnet that I was using for my research too. As a side note, it did actually slowly sink the building 36 freight elevator, which is why we left it on the first floor instead of trying to put it into our lab on the 7th floor.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/setup-6.jpg]!#@The food was really good. Aside from getting very fancy meals for dinner, breakfast, and lunch, we were basically fed every hour with cookies and refreshments in between. During the very last round of refreshments after the second poster session, I was delighted to find a jug of whole milk next to the half-and-half. Though I’m sure it was meant to be mixed with the coffee, I poured myself a full cup of milk since we were nearing the end of the conference anyway.!#@p!#@This was my very first research conference ever, and I couldn’t have imagined a better one.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-16-400x400.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-14-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-18-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-11-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-7-400x400.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-8-400x400.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-4-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-19-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-10-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-5-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-3-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-20-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-17-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-21.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/marc-15-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/setup-6.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/marc-2025-not-a-live-blog/
what I’m doing this IAP by Kai V. '25,mostly physics and musical theater,by Kai V. '25,"January 16, 2025","MIT has an Independent Activities Period, which we call IAP, during the month of January: some people treat it as a four-week extension on winter break, some people take classes or work on campus, lots of people are holding cool events and workshops.!#@p!#@IAP is my favorite time of year. It’s cold and dark and quiet outside; the river has frozen over; some mornings, any inch of skin exposed to the air goes numb in minutes. But this means the sunlight feels so bright (when it’s there) and hotpot with friends is justified (people are less busy than during the semester, and colder and hungrier) and a whole host of possibilities are available that get pushed to the back of my mind during the school year.!#@p!#@All my previous IAPs have been really fun. In freshman year, I did MITOC winter school⁠01 , worked on my plasma physics UROP, and spent twenty hours a week on SEVT⁠02 . In sophomore year, I helped with the Pi Day video animation and grinded for Battlecode with two of my friends. In junior year, I worked on a nuclear security UROP from 9-5 every day (though I was usually there more like 8-6), and when I got off work I’d walk to the climbing gym or the pool, and then cook dinner with friends.!#@p!#@This IAP I’m doing some similarly fun things!

"shifting seasons by Mel N. '24, MEng '25",something reflective,"by Mel N. '24, MEng '25","January 15, 2025","mementos!#@p!#@high school has been on my mind, lately. it’s been almost five years, and only now do i feel comfortable dusting off the little box where it lives in my mind and peering at what lies within.!#@p!#@some of this unboxing was literal — i visited my family’s place in vancouver over winter break. our belongings are still mostly sealed away in boxes and suitcases, since my parents are overseas and i’m in boston, so most of these old memories have been left to gather dust over the years. after i burned through my high-speed data for canada, there wasn’t much to do on my phone so i started poking around the house.!#@p!#@there were lots of goodies that were a pleasant surprise — a plethora of beautiful vintage bird stamps, two bags full of my old copic markers (expensive!), a couple prints made by my old watercolor teacher.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4246-1000x1333.jpg]!#@and then there were my yearbooks, and the various memorabilia associated with my school. if i’m remembering correctly, my graduation gifts consisted of a bizarre assortment: a cigar, a blue cowbell, 2020 glasses, cheap branded headphones, and a bundt cake. i found the headphones and the cowbell and the rest were either eaten or lost to the tides of time.!#@p!#@one item in particular stuck with me. every semester, for teacher-parent conferences i guess, teachers would write comments about how students were doing and what they were learning. i skimmed through many iterations of “a pleasure to have in class” and “needs to be more confident” before i saw what my sophomore year biology teacher wrote.!#@p!#@“one thing is clear: mel loves biology.” he talked about how my eyes would light up at anything we talked about in class, my extensive yet beautiful notes (back when i was into that sort of thing for studygram/studyblr), and his confidence in my potential as a scientist.!#@p!#@i felt my eyes burn, and i put it down.!#@p!#@i’ve always struggled with believing people when they say they believe in me. this was especially hard around graduation — it was a blur of festivities, photos, and encouraging cards that was over almost as soon as it started. somehow, it felt almost shameful to admit my grief when everyone else seemed so excited and happy. i didn’t want to spoil it for anyone.!#@p!#@in my last group therapy session, and my last lab meeting, people kept telling me how proud they were of me, how much i had impacted them, and i cried a lot, and i let people assume that they were (mostly) happy tears.!#@p!#@i spent the summer and fall semester trying to work through those emotions. what i landed on was that when the people i trust say that they believe in me, i owe to myself and to them to believe them. i trust that they wouldn’t lie to me, so i have to trust that they’re telling the truth — that i am capable, that i can do it.!#@p!#@this is something much easier said than done, and i ended fall semester on a bit of a low note, but break gave me the time i needed to reflect.!#@p!#@i’ve come so far since my shy, awkward high school self. being at mit has helped me come out of my shell more than anything. i’m so much better at identifying what i need, and how to go about fulfilling those, and how to help others fulfill their needs too.!#@p!#@connecting!#@p!#@somehow, i ended up being a teaching assistant for a 3 month biology class aimed at high schoolers. after the first couple sessions, i started feeling so grateful for all of the wonderful professors and instructors i had when mit was online, because engaging high schoolers over zoom is like trying to get a stray cat to come closer. sometimes your efforts and “pspsps”s will work, and other times you’ll just be met with complete and utter silence.!#@p!#@but, hey, i get it. turning on your camera and talking requires a certain kind of confidence that comes from learning to care less about what other people think, and that’s something i didn’t gain until college.!#@p!#@so i adapted. every time we went into breakout rooms, i’d start by asking them how they were doing on a scale of 1-10, and how well they understood the content we just covered on a scale of 1-10. it was kind of like a twitch stream, except the chat was only visible to me, because they would just send me direct messages instead of typing it to everyone, but i could still work with that.!#@p!#@and then i’d go into asking if people had questions, and answering the questions i did get to the best of my ability. i tried to always keep it real with them, because that’s what i always appreciated about my favorite teaching assistants. and i also tried to never make anyone feel bad for not answering — i’d always try to rephrase the question multiple times, something i noticed a professor of mine doing in a class i was taking that semester.!#@p!#@towards the end, even though i had no idea what most of these kids looked like, i felt like i was getting a sense of their personalities and strengths, and they were (maybe) warming up to me.!#@p!#@after it was over, i received a very sweet message from one student:!#@p!#@which…!#@p!#@being a high schooler is tough, man. being a high schooler in an online class that you may or may not be invested in is even tougher. i’ve been there. but i’m glad i could make a difference.!#@p!#@reconnecting!#@p!#@i only talk to two people from high school. granted, my school was tiny; there were around 90 kids in my grade. i lost touch with most of them because i moved right after graduating, and i also don’t use instagram all that much these days — mostly because scrolling feels more like a chore there than anything.!#@p!#@with the two people i do talk to, it’s very sporadic and we often go long periods without exchanging any messages. but we still somehow keep each other updated on the important things.!#@p!#@in the past couple of days, the stars aligned and i ended up reconnecting with both of them.!#@p!#@quinn was my partner in crime when it came to high school journalism, and i ended up getting lunch with her over the summer in minnesota when i visited with chris (the first time i returned in almost four years). she has a penchant for sending wonderfully hilarious and informative audio messages, which i’ve always loved about her, and i was lucky enough to get a series of them yesterday. i listened to them on my walk to campus to pick up my monthly t-pass (since you can get a discounted pass as an mit student, and especially as a grad student as long as you make a request ahead of time) and my meds. it made me so happy.!#@p!#@ryan was the first friend i made in high school and we were quite the dynamic duo. we got up to all kinds of shenanigans — depleting snack bins that were technically off-limits and driving circles around my block, talking about everything and anything in our little teenage lives. i was in the central square target buying cat food and listening to pearl jam when i got a call from him. there was some brief reshuffling in which i had to call him back because my airpods weren’t putting anything through, but then we were talking like old times again while i walked up and down the home aisle, trying to balance everything in my hands and also musing on whether i should buy a plastic wastebin to wash my bulky wool sweaters in.!#@p!#@(i did not end up buying the wastebin, but i did buy a tub scrubber with a long handle, so i’m hoping that i can get the bathtub really clean and do a big wash session in there instead.)!#@p!#@it felt really good to hear their voices again, grainy and crackled through my phone. they both sound older and wiser. we’ve all grown a lot. and this is famously a strange time in our lives — we’ve graduated from college and we’re trying to figure out what our next steps are going to be. but just as i said to ryan, no matter how confusing things get, i know we’ll always be in each other’s corners through these changing seasons of our lives.!#@p!#@so, for 2025 i’ll love my friends, try new things, and get a little silly with it. i’ll handle the roadbumps as they come. i know i will.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4246-1000x1333.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/shifting-seasons/
[Liveblog] MARC 2025 by Andi Q. '25,"A sciencey science conference, feature Anika '26 and me",by Andi Q. '25,"January 14, 2025","Day 1, 6 PM!#@p!#@Today is the first day of MARC 2025 (the Microsystems Annual Research Conference) – MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratory’s (MTL) annual conference, featuring two days of MIT students presenting their research to MTL’s industry sponsors like Lam Research and GlobalFoundries. It’s also a (heavily subsidized) ski trip! Because MARC isn’t only about serious science; it’s also an opportunity for the MTL community to get together and have fun before the spring semester starts.!#@p!#@Unlike last year, when I tagged along at MARC despite my nonexistent research output (I guess being an undergrad made it okay), I have a poster to present this year! (Stay tuned until day 2 to see it.) Also unlike last year, when our blogs were restricted to use only the top 1000 most common English words, I can describe things in a non-caveman-like way this year! Goodbye “sticking-together rocks”; hello “magnets”!!#@p!#@Anika ’26 is here too, which was a pleasant surprise!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0621-1-800x600.jpg]!#@The conference kicked off at 10 AM with “winter activities” at the ski resort by our hotel. I went snowboarding, while Anika went cross-country skiing. It was my first time ever snowboarding; I went skiing last year during MARC and thought the snowboarding people looked so cool, so I decided to give it a shot this year.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, I severely underestimated the difficulty of snowboarding, which I quickly realized as I fell onto my face within the first ten seconds of going down the bunny slope. It turns out that snowboarding is completely different from skiing, skateboarding, or any other sport I’ve tried before. It’s fast, terrifying, and cold. (Just like MIT.) But it was really fun and I loved it, even though my body now hurts everywhere because I kept falling on my face. (Just like MIT.)!#@p!#@I heard Anika had a great time cross-country skiing though, with none of the wipeouts I endured during snowboarding.!#@p!#@Anyway, after all that excitement, we got to the hotel and checked in. I’m currently sitting in the lobby writing this post while I wait for the opening ceremony (and dinner!) to begin. Be back in ~1 hour.!#@p!#@Day 1, 9 PM!#@p!#@Ok, so that was much longer than 1 hour, but the opening banquet had a lot going on and it felt wrong to pull out my laptop (under my seat) and blog during dinner. But now it’s time for the conference’s evening activities, so I finally have a chance to update you on what happened.!#@p!#@The banquet started with Professor Tomas Palacios (director of MTL) giving a presentation with opening remarks. Apparently, MARC has over 300 people attending this year! Anyway, Professor Palacios has a very… unique style of presentation that is best experienced visually. (Apologies in advance for the jank pictures.)!#@p!#@Part 1:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0128.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0129.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0130.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0132.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0136.png]!#@Part 2:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0137.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0139.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0140.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0142.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0143.png]!#@Part 3:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0144.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0145.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0146.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0147.png]!#@Next, there was an MTL-themed trivia game. Even though we got ~10 people per team, the questions were still rather tricky. Try to see how many of these you can answer (without Googling)!!#@p!#@Nobody at my table knew what “CHIPS” stood for, so we guessed “creating happy international packaged semiconductors”. Somehow, this still sounds more realistic than the real answer.!#@p!#@After dinner, there was an “academia vs. industry” panel, with four MIT professors and three industry representatives from Lam Research, IBM, and GlobalFoundries:!#@p!#@(I stopped paying attention at this point because it was getting late and I was still physically exhausted from snowboarding earlier today. I think they just talked about the importance of recruitment until the end of the panel.)!#@p!#@It’s probably time for me to go to sleep now, so I’ll see you all tomorrow at 9 AM when the conference switches gear into academic mode.!#@p!#@Day 1, 9:45 PM!#@p!#@Oh actually, one more thing before I go – one of my friends mentioned that the hotel looks a lot like the Overlook Hotel from The Shining, and now I can’t unsee it.!#@p!#@Day 2, 7:30 AM!#@p!#@1.5 hours before the conference begins! Until then, check out this year’s entries for the MTL photo competition:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0125.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0124.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0123.png]!#@I think #15 (“Hitting the slopes at MARC”) looks the coolest, but #2 (“SEM photo of unknown particle on plastic substrate which is ruining my device ☹“) best captures the essence of microelectronics research.!#@p!#@Day 2, 9:30 AM!#@p!#@We started off the day with some opening remarks from Professor Vladimir Bulovic, director of MIT.nano. His talk was all about how it takes “just moments” to think of groundbreaking inventions, but several years (sometimes decades) to scale up those inventions to have a tangible impact on the world. Some examples he gave:!#@p!#@It’s a bit depressing to think about how long it takes for academic research to become “useful”, but that’s exactly what MIT.nano and initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act are trying to change.!#@p!#@Another cool thing Professor Bulovic talked about was all the big players of the semiconductor industry that were MIT alumni:!#@p!#@Day 2, 10:30 AM!#@p!#@We have a 20-minute break before the poster sessions and 1-minute poster pitches (the most exciting non-ski part of the conference). Right before this, we had a keynote talk from Deirdre Hanford, CEO of Natcast. Natcast isn’t really a commercial company like IBM or Lam Research, but more a non-profit consortium that generally works to advance the US semiconductor industry.!#@p!#@The talk was mostly about the National Semiconductor Technology Center’s (NSTC) goals, like “extend US semiconductor leadership” and “reduce time and cost to prototype” – a lot of which was already discussed in earlier talks at MARC.!#@p!#@The talk also focused on the skyrocketing energy consumption of AI. For example, did you know that Google’s LLM-powered search results use more than 25x more energy than a traditional Google search? That Sam Altman wants to create an OpenAI datacenter that will consume as much power as Miami? And that datacenters in Virginia consume about a quarter of the state’s power? Once again, AI is the worst.!#@p!#@Day 2, 11 AM!#@p!#@Pitch time! Here are some people’s projects (most people opted not to do a pitch), in rapid-fire:!#@p!#@Day 2, 1 PM!#@p!#@After the 1-minute pitch session, we had our first poster session of the day.!#@p!#@Here’s my poster:!#@p!#@And Anika’s!!#@p!#@I wish I could’ve walked around more to see what everyone else’s posters were about, but I had to stand near my poster and answer questions about it. Some of the questions people asked I didn’t know how to answer completely (e.g. “how do Josephson junctions work?”), which was a little scary, but they seemed okay with that.!#@p!#@Day 2, 1:30 PM!#@p!#@On a somewhat unrelated note, Professor Karl Berggren (the professor I do research with) is officially the new head of electrical engineering at MIT!!#@p!#@Day 2, 2:30 PM!#@p!#@I’m currently at a panel about transitioning from academia to startups. The panelists include two MTL-affiliated startup founders (the companies are FabuBlox and Active Surfaces), a founding partner of a venture capital firm, and Professor Dave Perrault (also a startup founder and head of house for Simmons). FabuBlox makes software for designing nanofabrication processes, while Active Surfaces makes printable solar panels that can stick onto any surface.!#@p!#@I’m not very entrepreneurial at all, but it was still interesting to hear from this panel because hardware and “deep tech” startups are much rarer than (and completely different from) software and AI startups that I’m more familiar with. The advice they gave was also very reasonable (none of that “drop out of MIT” that software startup bros tend to spew out):!#@p!#@Day 2, 3 PM!#@p!#@Round 2 of poster pitches! (I forgot to link this previously, but you can match these descriptions to their official titles here.)!#@p!#@Day 2, 5 PM!#@p!#@A second poster session and some closing remarks later, and MARC 2025 is over! What a fun conference this has been. Anika and I are on the bus back to MIT now, but the adventure isn’t quite over yet – stay tuned for Anika’s version of events, coming to an MIT Admissions near you.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0621-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0128.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0129.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0130.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0132.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0136.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0137.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0139.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0140.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0142.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0143.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0144.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0145.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0146.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0147.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0125.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0124.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0123.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/liveblog-marc-2025/
[live blogging] astronomy field camp by Fatima A. '25,sky stalking in tenerife,by Fatima A. '25,"January 14, 2025","14/01/2025 20:00!#@p!#@this IAP, i am in Tenerife for 12.411 (astronomy field camp), which is an observational astronomy lab intensive class that satisfies the thesis requirement for astronomy minors and some unknown requirement for course 12 (earth and planetary science) majors. as part of the class, we work on various research projects, taking and reducing our own data. usually, we take projects various people are working on and obtain the data they need as part of a larger project. the class ends with final presentations and write-ups to the PI that explain the data taken and results deduced. today, i am observing at Artemis, which is a 1m optical infrared telescope part of the SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) program which hunts for exoplanets around cool stars. i am here with Jayna E. ’27 and since both of us are driving this for the first time, Jensen (TA) and Amius are teaching us how to use it. the procedure for running Artemis is fairly automated so I will be heading over to IAC-80 (80cm telescope) at some point and then, the observing shall continue until some point in the morning. Wahoo.!#@p!#@14/01/2025 22:01!#@p!#@we had to wait until around 8:40p for one of the exoplanet targets to become high enough to be visible because we were unclear on the exposure times. the way Artemis works is that you write a small operating plan for each of your targets with details of how you want it to be observed: filter, exposure time, binning etc. These files are chained together and input to a script which runs them automatically. So, you can let it run on its own once you have all the input files and leave early (wahoo). Dinner happened around 9-10p, then back to the grind!!#@p!#@notable things that happened during dinner: i got bullied by Prajna N. ’25, i was asked to publicly apologize to Prajna for bullying her, i dropped my fork, we learned that Jensen is a elder sibling, Jayna was bullied for being young (“i am 19” she screams).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sad-dinner-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seeing-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/prajna-seeing-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/pondering_the_orb-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dont_look_artem-800x600.jpg]!#@14/01/2025 22:40!#@p!#@after double-checking scripts for the night, we headed over to IAC-80 (for the vibes, we didn’t have to). here, we joined Prajna and Zimi, the drivers, Artem (!!) (father of Artemis and one of our instructors), and Kaylee B. ’26 (who observed with me on IAC-80 and was teaching the others) and Matthew.!#@p!#@here, we learned that Jensen has watched Dhoom 2 and knows the song Amplifier (??), which was not on my bingo card for Tenerife. now, we are listening to banger Malayalam songs. i am not actually on observing duty for IAC-80 today, so i will be locking out and maybe fix my life and work on this blog.!#@p!#@15/01/2025 2:22!#@p!#@in my attempts to “fix my life,” i decided to look at graduate schools that require fall grades, which led to a long series of crying over graduate school applications, where i stressed out over grades, not having a focus, etc. among other things. in this time, Prajna submitted her last graduate school application (wahoo!) and the rest of us swam in a sea of anxiety while Jensen provided his wisdom.!#@p!#@some Ws that were had: Matthew put his best score on Minesweeper by 10 seconds (to 120 seconds)!! we found a supernova in a nice, big galaxy! we added another Koronis asteroid target! Jensen had a conversation in Spanish with the telescope operator which was very impressive. other than that, a lot of unhinged content was produced. the drivers want you to know that the seeing has gone up to 2.2, tragic.!#@p!#@driver quotes:!#@p!#@Prajna: “my mom thought i would never learn to drive but if she could look at me now”
me: “she would be like you still can’t”!#@p!#@Zimi: “i hate when the machine learns more than i do”!#@p!#@the science.!#@p!#@today on the IAC-80, we are observing multiple supernovae and Koronis targets, which are (Prajna, Jayna)’s and (Zimi, Matthew)’s projects respectively. here is a bit about their projects:
Matthew: One of my projects is focusing on the Koronis asteroid family. It’ll be part of a long-duration project tracking the rotation vectors of asteroids in the asteroid belt. It’s hypothesized that the Koronis family was once one larger asteroid that broke apart (possibly from a collision). By observing the current motion of the asteroids, we can go backwards to hopefully discover how the asteroids were formed :3!#@p!#@Zimi: The axes of rotation of the Koronis asteroids are all aligned in one of two directions, which is also strange (since over time, the directions should have randomized). If we observe an asteroid for 5 years, we can determine its axis of rotation! Some asteroids on our list will be observed for their 5th year this month :000 so exciting!#@p!#@Prajna: We are working on categorizing recently discovered supernovae using photometric data! Basically that means we hunt for transients that were discovered in the last couple days in large online databases, and try to observe their change in brightness using our lovely telescopes here. To be able to categorize supernovae, we need at least one week of continuous observations. The challenges are that 1) supernovae can either brighten or fade in the few days past initial discovery and if we catch them in the fading part of the curve, they may be too faint to see in our images for a full week of observations 2) sometimes supernovae get eaten by gigantic space monsters and we can’t see them period (paraphrasing Jayna’s words here)!#@p!#@15/01/2025 3:15!#@p!#@we are moving to Tampere, one of the Koronis asteroids. we tried a new supernova target but the moon was working against us as per usual. i tried to turn Jensen back to the dark side, that is theory, but to no avail. the attempts will continue though :sneaky:!#@p!#@sprinkled between running in to make sure everything was running all well, there was conversation about things one could do over a gap year. it seems reasonable to do something related to one’s field or just go out into the woods and become a park ranger.!#@p!#@14/01/2025 3:53!#@p!#@we lost Jensen. Kales and Matthew are also gone because according to Kales, “it is just not as fun without Jensen.” Prajna has officially “lost it.” i have been working on one of my last remaining graduate school applications.!#@p!#@15/01/2025 4:36!#@p!#@humidity went up from 0.9% to 7% (which is not a problem at all, but still a jump) and wind speed went up to 31 km/hr, which could be a problem if it keeps rising. the telescope closes at wind speeds around 45 km/hr, which happened yesterday. fingers crossed.!#@p!#@15/01/2025 5:43!#@p!#@everything is going quietly and well at the telescope. i am heading back now, but the drivers will stay until about 7 when they will close up the telescope and return. more updates when i wake up!!#@p!#@15/01/2025 17:24!#@p!#@i woke up around 12:30 to the distance sounds of Prajna in pain. some context for this is that some team had discovered supernovae the Monday before we started observing (which was on Thursday). but when Prajna and Jayna analyzed the data they had obtained, there was simply nothing there. it was as though it had completely disappeared. upon inspection, Prajna found that the telescope that first made the observation specializes, among other things, in looking for very short-lived transients that last less than a day. eventually, they decided to email the team that first made the observation and this morning, they got a response. it turns out, it was an asteroid…!#@p!#@the observations were taken very close together and so they failed to see the asteroid move. tragic.!#@p!#@after this, people slowly began to leave for lunch which is 1:30-2:30. i stayed back and ate stuff at home and then headed over for the daily meeting.!#@p!#@in the daily meeting—usually after lunch to make sure people on observing duty can sleep a bit—we go over how observing went the previous night, talk about project updates and the observing plan for the next night. it seems that we will be losing some observing nights to bad weather next week which is deeply tragic.!#@p!#@after meeting, we continued to work in the conference room for a while. i was working on reducing data to get light curves of Alinda, a near-Earth asteroid which made its closest approach to the Earth just before camp started. since it moves very fast, we have to move the telescope about every half hour/hour to make sure it is always in the field of view. so it is taking me forever to get data reduced from each of these chunks from the first night. 6/7 done though, wahoo!!#@p!#@i came back 5 to update this post, etc. but the data processing will continue. tonight, we are observing on the Carlos Sánchez telescope, the 1.5m telescope. the fun thing about this telescope is that you have to manually open the petals that cover the mirror, so most of us will be heading over to see that around 6!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/0-humidity-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/asteroid-1.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/reduce-data-1-800x450.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sad-dinner-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/seeing-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/prajna-seeing-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/pondering_the_orb-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dont_look_artem-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/0-humidity-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/asteroid-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/reduce-data-1-800x450.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/live-blogging-astronomy-field-camp/
2024 in Review by Uzay G. '26,the things and stuff of 2024,by Uzay G. '26,"January 13, 2025","This was one of the years of all time. I learned a lot, less about science than usual but more about relationships and who I am. It was a bit painful at times, but there were also many great things.!#@p!#@I caught glimpses of some beautiful ideas, I settled into my life at MIT and now have a circle of people who inspire me and illuminate my life, and I feel more confident to face the world, knowing my strengths and weaknesses a bit better. I also did a lot of collaborative work and really appreciate that kind of thing much more now!!#@p!#@I tried to do research really hard. I grinded, and developed, but I struggled. I am trying to finish the projects I’ve been doing and put them out this month mostly. Quality research is challenging.!#@p!#@In 2024 I developed strength and self reliance. Obviously it’s normal to depend on others, but this year I saw myself confronted with the fallbacks of depending too much. I learned to be happier on my own, and develop a slightly healthier, more understanding mindset towards the way I end up living my life. This year I have had deep, beautiful friendships that I am beyond grateful for. But in some of these lows, I grappled with a sense that things were off, that there was some true connection right around the corner but always out of grasp. I was bound by expectation, waiting to see and be seen by somene. This expectation weighs on others and destroys your lucidity. Instead I have been trying to, mostly successfully after a while, choose to take in the things that bring color to my life, and nurture them from a place of strength. When you are no longer dependent on someone or something in an existential, unhealthy way, you can more clearly see things as you are. You can recognize both the pain and the beauty of the things you are graced with in your friendships, relationships, etc… and then choose what deserves a place in your life.!#@p!#@I think my sense of beauty is growing more and more. I watched some movies that I really liked this year, and I wrote more poetry. Some images really stuck with me deeply, and I want to keep seeking out these kinds of insane artistic experiences.!#@p!#@I have a much better model of what it means to be a researcher thinking about the questions that I’m interested in. Although it may not seem like it from my outputs, I have a better sense of a real agenda I can pursue that satisfies me intellectually/aesthetically and genuinely matters.!#@p!#@I know that I will keep learning, seeking out art, people and new experiences. I know that I will create the conditions for my goals wherever I am, and I know that the world will change faster and faster. I feel okay about all of this, and am excited by everything that lies ahead.!#@p!#@I am in a bit of a corny mood tonight, so I want to leave one message to that person looking back, and it is this: go find the magic. Drink it down without greed, but don’t forget its slow passage. If your mindset goes sour remember there is so much beauty to grasp always. In the famous words of Baudelaire, re-enacted here by Serge Reggiani:!#@p!#@How is it that I get to live every day and see all this magic? that I can learn more about the structure of this world? That I get to think about the unbelievable beauty day after day crystallized in the slow motion of particles, in shapes mapping in and out of each other or the practice of poetry, and this web of rich inner lives illuminating each other? that I love these people and their personable, similar and yet alien outlooks bouncing off against mine? that I get to feel understood and seen, that you understand a view on who I am and choose to walk it through day after day? how is that I get to experience these lives singing against mine for as long as we choose to? and that even after that, I will get to collect these sweet postcards on the road that have made me this single person, lost in immensity, writing it all down?!#@p!#@And so, read this as a catalogue of magic; of passion blooming out and in; of dreams being workshopped; I learned a cool phrase just now, kangai muryō – I am overwhelmed by the beauty of things, and I will stay overwhelmed. Will you come along with me?!#@p!#@~~!#@p!#@[… this section is to be improved, probably as a separate post because of how much attention it deserves]!#@p!#@I don’t want to get into the weeds here just yet, but this is probably where most of my learning has gone.!#@p!#@I’ve been working on a few projects:!#@p!#@I don’t want to post too much about the future but there are a lot of ideas I’m excited about here. I will also post something about the papers that have stood to me so far. Excited to keep hopping along this research journey.!#@p!#@I’m converging a bit on the type of work/setting I will want to work in long term. I am strongly considering applying to graduate school, and I want a lot of independence. I believe at some point I will pivot to some sort of research startup, where a set of friends and I with a few takes and ideas try to make something happen, in ML. Already currently starting to do things along this vein.!#@p!#@The memorable ones!!#@p!#@I also did two reading programs with grad students for the MIT directed reading programs, where we read through technical content and then I presented at the end to my fellow students!!#@p!#@Not much! Lots of journaling/independent stuff but not much I wanted to post.!#@p!#@I did a lot of writing for my classes, as I mentioned before, in poetry and essays, which I want to catch up to and put out there. My 3 public posts are here, mostly life updates and some thoughts.!#@p!#@I wrote papers! LOL!#@p!#@And some technical writing.

"books I read in 2024, ranked by Kai V. '25",and thoughts on the best ones,by Kai V. '25,"January 13, 2025","This year I read 20 books. Here they are in a tier list, ranked based on personal enjoyment/emotional impact and not at all on literary merit or perceived quality, because:!#@p!#@1) I don’t trust myself to make a competent assessment along that axis—eg Ocean Vuong’s poetry collection would probably be higher if I felt capable of Actually Understanding Poetry, but I want to avoid arbitrarily ranking critically acclaimed books higher based on some aspect I don’t feel like I understood.!#@p!#@2) I think you only care about the enjoyment/impact axis if you’re reading this, like you can just scroll a Harvard Great Books class syllabus or something if you want a books-by-literary-merit list.!#@p!#@Here’s how you should interpret the letters, and a list of all the books.!#@p!#@Originally I was going to write something about every single book on the list but now I realize that I am lazy. However, I feel really strongly about my S tier books so I’ll say something about each of them.!#@p!#@This is my favorite book I have ever read—for its emotional impact on me, but also for expanding what I thought you could do with literature. I’m in love with the way Ishiguro approaches characterization through unreliable narration. I often hear “unreliable narrator” used to refer to an agent with ulterior motives who purposely obscures information from the reader. But that’s not how I’m using the term—instead Ishiguro evokes an unsettling feeling that something is wrong, that the narrator’s own model of their world is precarious, even if the narrator seems largely sane and competent. The details the narrator relays tell you how history shaped them. The details the narrator doesn’t relay tell you about their psyche, the nature of their denial, the gaping hole that the reader is forced to reckon with and fill in on their own.!#@p!#@Even in Ishiguro novels that I’m less fond of (Klara and the Sun was mid; When We Were Orphans was mildly incoherent), this characterization is always skillfully done. But nowhere is it done better than The Remains of the Day. A butler past the prime of his career takes a tour through England and reminisces on his days serving his former lord. There are maybe two sentences in the novel in which he directly addresses the feeling that we might expect from someone in his circumstances. Everything else has to be inferred. Yet the subtle pressures the story applies to us shape the inferred conclusion so sharply and clearly that the result is far more heartbreaking than any explicit admission of emotion could be.!#@p!#@It seems like Ishiguro doesn’t hit hard for everyone, but I’d still say this novel is my highest recommendation.!#@p!#@I read the first chapter of Fun Home at the start of my junior year of high school. It was part of an anthology assigned in English class. That single chapter left such a deep impression on me that, five years later, when I happened to pick up this book from a store shelf and leaf through it, I recognized it immediately—despite having long forgotten the author and title—based on what I can only describe as the rhythm of the writing, and finished it standing right there at the shelf for two hours.!#@p!#@Fun Home is a graphic novel about Bechdel’s childhood, focusing in particular on her tenuous relationship with her closeted father and her own realization that she was gay. Most of my sense of literary aesthetic (as in, my sense of whether a piece of writing is beautiful or not) is derived from that first chapter, which accomplished its task so completely and perfectly that it convinced me forever of the power of a well-crafted personal essay. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if I hadn’t read that, I likely wouldn’t be writing blogs now. I don’t know if I just reread it that many times when I encountered it in high school, or if it struck a deep, already-existing chord, calling to the surface a sense of pacing and beauty—on the sentence level and on the essay level—that already existed inside me.!#@p!#@Its graphic novel nature enables each page to tell multiple sub-stories at once as parallel threads which sometimes intersect. There’s current-Alison’s train of thought, in full sentences. Past-Alison’s perception of the story, in dialogue and illustration, which also work to frame current-Alison’s thoughts, and all the parallels between her and her father, set up as camera angles and matching silhouettes. It’s really impressive if you read the actual book. Bechdel generally achieves a smooth, cohesive stream of thought from the beginning to the end of a chapter, in which three or four threads are set up when the chapter begins and interact through dialogue, illustration, literary allusion, and caption until the end. It’s done very precisely and elegantly.!#@p!#@This was by far my most surprising read of the year! I’ve tried Rooney before but have always found that I cannot stand her writing. Normal People is one of the few books in the world that frustrated me so much that I just stopped reading it. (I think it’s the only book I’ve ever given one star on Goodreads lol.) After Intermezzo, I’ll probably give her other novels a more serious chance again.!#@p!#@Here were my two problems with Normal People:!#@p!#@1) I find it really frustrating when the central conflict of a story could easily be resolved by clear communication, especially when we’re meant to believe that the characters are Deep, Thoughtful, Kind People. I’m told this is just how things turn out sometimes in real life, but it doesn’t make for an engaging story. Maybe I’ll relate to this kind of thing one day when I’m inexplicably in love with someone I don’t know how to talk to?? What??!#@p!#@2) Rooney’s writing style is usually quite dry? She describes the chain of events as it’s happening, using the exact same tone across all situations. She omits quotation marks as a stylistic choice, merging the character’s experience of reality with their own stream of consciousness. I mean, I get it. I also hate it.!#@p!#@These two aspects of her writing unfortunately totally prevented me from appreciating the deep understanding of human relationships that each rave NYT review claimed her novels captured. Happily, neither was a problem for me in Intermezzo.!#@p!#@Intermezzo follows two brothers, a decade apart in age, navigating their very different spheres of life after the death of their father. Because the story is written by Sally Rooney this entails some complicated romantic entanglements. I felt that the conflicts here were true and that the characters tried their best to communicate with each other honestly—and when a misunderstanding occurred it was for a real, substantive reason (which—yes—can be human weakness: fear, cowardice, pride), as opposed to feeling contrived for the sake of having a conflict.!#@p!#@The writing style might have been my favorite aspect of the novel. The novel hops between the perspectives of Ivan, the younger brother; Peter, the older brother; and Margaret, one of the women involved. Rooney employs a distinct tone for each of them which feels pretty far from her impersonal dry style in previous stories, and because it feels so much like we’re actually listening to the thoughts of the characters, the omission of quotation marks works to merge the current character’s experience of reality into their stream of consciousness. (This is maybe the first book I’ve said this about?)!#@p!#@I think, also, that characterization can easily feel stilted or awkward. An author tries to shove too much into one character. Different bits don’t make sense together. Or, in fear of this, the author shrinks back from too much explicit characterization altogether. Intermezzo does a good job of striking a difficult balance here: Peter and Ivan felt very true.!#@p!#@Looking back rationally on the story, I think Peter’s ending was a little bit contrived, and I loved Margaret’s chapters but think the book would have been more cohesive without her external perspective, with more space to develop the brothers. At its core it’s about the relationship between Peter and Ivan, and I get that Margaret was supposed to deliver some reasoned external perspective, but I wish there was a version where we only perceive the brothers through each other’s eyes.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/books-i-read-in-2024-ranked/
reviewing MIT’s Intro To Deep Learning by Aiden H. '28,the highs and lows of the beloved IAP class,by Aiden H. '28,"January 12, 2025","This past week was the first week of IAP.⁠01 Along with a UROP,⁠02 I took Intro to Deep Learning (or 6.S191, which no one calls it), an annual class taught by two former MIT students turned power couple, Alexander and Ava Amini.!#@p!#@Since the class started, it has kind of blown up due to all of the lectures and labs being open-sourced on the website and Youtube, with this Obama deepfake specifically making the rounds in 2020.!#@p!#@Given the opportunity to take such a famed class, I decided to give my unabashed⁠03 thoughts.!#@p!#@Lectures!#@p!#@The class ran from Monday to Friday with a scheduled 1:00-4:00 P.M. lecture time. Each day was scheduled for “two” lectures, one given by Alexander and one given by Ava. Typically they lasted only a little over an hour each, meaning I ended up leaving around 3:15 each day while the remaining lecture time was used as office hours with the TA’s.!#@p!#@Having no prior knowledge of deep learning except that one 3Blue1Brown video, I found the lectures relatively straightforward in terms of how they explained the foundational architecture around different deep learning networks. Since there was extra time everyday, the lecturers were also very open to answering lots of questions,⁠04 even in a lecture hall of like 250. Still, the length of pure lecture on completely new, high-level material felt pretty draining. Because Alexander and Ava are high-up industry professionals who probably can’t take more than a week off of work, I understand the pressed schedule. From a purely logistical standpoint, I think two weeks with more time to digest and review material would have solidified my understanding more. For example, they went over CNNs, VAEs, and GANs in one day, and of course by the next morning I couldn’t articulate to you the differences with each because we went straight into types of reinforcement learning.!#@p!#@Additionally, I understand why with such a short timeframe and an attempt to be open-sourced to as many people as possible that the lectures were purely theoretical, but I kind of needed and wanted the mathematical basis behind a lot of these structures. To say they skimmed over the most important math would be false–the first lectures were leaned heavily on matrix operations, propagation with non-linearities, the loss function and gradient descent, etc.–but once applied to different structures, I felt loss on exactly what was happening between layers or even across structures. How did each differ mathematically? Is there a way to view vector and matrix values at each point in a deep neural network? Again, as I don’t know much about deep learning, I don’t know if this a niche thing to call out or an important topic skimmed over, but for an MIT crowd, I want to see the numbers move! Maybe they didn’t want to assume that much linear algebra knowledge though.!#@p!#@After three days of intro lectures, Thursday and Friday has class sponsors come give guest lectures on a variety of topics to give more specifics on industry-specific applications. I found these to be very hit or miss with how informative they actually were. Ava gave the last guest lecture on deep learning for biology (which duh was my favorite), but because I personally am only interested in that topic compared to something like LLMs, I got pretty bored by other lectures no matter how engaging and passionate a presenter they are. For students who genuinely come into the class without any knowledge of deep learning (which is becoming increasingly less likely), the variety of these guest lectures could help inform how they want to enter the field. For students or industry professionals who have already chosen a sector, these were less helpful, since tactical knowledge > inspiration.!#@p!#@Nonetheless, there is something really important to say about both Alexander and Ava’s ability to teach these topics to such a broad audience (in person and online) and also their desire to apply them to the modernizing deep learning landscape. Although I don’t know how different this year was compared to previous ones, they made sure to focus on how everything can be applied to the rise of now-widespread tech like LLMs/chatbots or self-driving cars that exploded in recent years.!#@p!#@Software Labs!#@p!#@In tandem with the first three lectures, there were three online coding “labs” that walk through some of the basics of deep learning implementation. The labs themselves were pretty straightforward, not requiring students to write the code for an entire model but instead only fill in some lines of code here and there, but they had pretty cool implementations (a song generator, a face debiasing system, and a chatbot that speaks like Yoda). The labs were not required to pass the class, but completing them and uploading them along with a written explanation of what you did allowed you to enter into a contest for a prize (headphones, a desktop monitor, and a Kindle, respectively).!#@p!#@Starting with the pros, the labs each had very interesting applications that definitely helped distract from the fairly monotonous complexity that learning abstract computer science in a lecture style has. Also not having them all be required took some weight off of the beginning of the week, allowing me to choose which labs I was more interested in completing, considering each one took at least an hour to complete and hours more to hone for competition’s sake.!#@p!#@Now for the rant. I would say that the access to labs of this quality is definitely something to be grateful for, also considering they are open-sourced for millions. But the quality of the work derived from the labs was not worth the amount of time spent on them. Although unrealistic for beginner level engineers to create their own models, a majority of the labs were spent in Google Colab⁠05 just importing things I’ve never heard of and running patches of code that were vaguely explained but that I couldn’t possibly begin to create on my own. Also when trying to better my code, I quickly ran into the free GPU limit on Colab so I ended up having to redo it all on separate Google accounts (which on Colab means rerunning every cell, some of which took like 30 minutes because, yk, training takes a while). A similar issue occurred when using the external sites for APIs and exports they had recommended because they were created by the course sponsors/guest lecturers (all of which is nice, but highkey weren’t that user friendly or reliable softwares). Finally, one of the cells of code that was prewritten straight up didn’t work and I⁠06 tried to fix it but because I didn’t have access to the dictionary they were using (because it was imported), so I didn’t even know where to start.!#@p!#@On lab 3 (training an LLM to speak like Yoda), I tried for like 6+ hours over multiple days to try and create the best model in order to win the contest, but I kept giving up because factors beyond my control kept limiting what I could do and made the process very laborious (see: I ran out of GPU so I switched accounts which meant running the hour of code again only to notice my free API key had expired so I had to do it again the next morning but Colab sucks and actually didn’t save right etc. etc. etc.). In the end I didn’t even have a final product.!#@p!#@Nonetheless, all of my bitching and moaning can’t be taken as too serious of a negative, because as stated before, none of this was technically required, it just did give me a bit of hassle.!#@p!#@Final Presentation!#@p!#@For MIT students taking the class for credit, there were two options for a final project to be submitted by Friday’s lecture: a one-pager reviewing a deep learning paper (boring!) or a 5 minute group presentation on a deep learning proposal to be given at the end of Friday’s lecture (definitely less boring!). Doing the proposal also put MIT-based teams up for the “grand prizes” of Apple Watches, desktop monitors, and a NVIDIA 4070 GPU.⁠07!#@p!#@I worked with some other course 6-7⁠08 freshman friends on an application that we all had general UROP experience with the night before it was due, and imo we cranked out a pretty good project.⁠09 Tragically the night before presentations at midnight, the course staff announced that because so many people opted to present over the paper, presentations had to be cut from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. **cue major panic**!#@p!#@After the final two guest lectures on Friday, we got to sit and listen to everyone’s final project proposals, which was pretty interesting considering people taking the class ranged from MIT freshman to students at other universities who travelled for the class to literal business professionals with like master’s degrees who took off work to take this for fun. Ngl though, having to listen to two hours of presentations after two hours of lecture was verrrry draining and I was verrrry over it in the end. You could also definitely tell that most presentations were cut short or glossed over because of the time though, but also I understand why we couldn’t all stay there until 8:00 P.M. listening to projects. They even brought out a mini gong to ring (hit? strike? play?) when your team’s time was up (even though a lot of people kept talking anyway!!!!!!!), which was hilarious.!#@p!#@In the end my team didn’t place top 3, but that’s okay⁠10 because there were a ton of cool and unique projects. You can see all final presentation slides here (…I was in group 6)!!#@p!#@How much I learned: 8/10!#@p!#@Difficulty/homework: 6/10!#@p!#@Pacing: 4/10!#@p!#@How much free stuff I got: 6/10 (I got one shirt, but that’s definitely above average for a class)⁠12!#@p!#@Overall: 6/10 – a slightly above average class!#@p!#@tl;dr fine class lol!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/reviewing-mits-intro-to-deep-learning/
a postcard from GTL Spain by Veronica P. '27,finding myself or something like that,by Veronica P. '27,"January 9, 2025","!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2589-400x225.jpg]!#@9/8/2025!#@p!#@Dear blog,!#@p!#@Last night, I arrived to Figueres by train around 9:30. With two suitcases in tow— taking full advantage of of United Airline’s weight limit— it was the perfect day for all of the escalators in Catalonia to be down. Certainly— I decided as I rode from one crowded platform to the next— the amount of times I had dropped my luggage in the past hour was enough embarrassment for all of 2025.!#@p!#@Not 30 minutes later, I found myself stuck (yes, stuck.) in the bathroom. Despite all my best efforts, I couldn’t get the lock to turn. My host family was sweetly setting the table for a proper Spanish meal when they received the Whatsapp message- “Sorry to bother, but I think I may be trapped in the upstairs restroom.”!#@p!#@Suddenly, I heard a storm of footsteps up the stairs and a flurry of multilingual exclamations: pon tu pie aquí – did you turn the lock the right away? – tienes que empujar muy duro – Are you okay?!#@p!#@After we came to the mutual realization that there was absolutely no way I was unjamming the door on my own, my host brother climbed up through the shower window and came to the rescue. Freedom at last!!#@p!#@So you could definitely say that my first dinner in Spain began with great icebreaker material.!#@p!#@Although school 01 started today— much to the dismay of my younger host sister— I had the day off to adjust to the jet lag. The brother, my age and still a few days shy from returning to his college in the US, was also free and thus tasked with giving me a tour of Figueres and the surrounding towns.!#@p!#@Between winding mountain roads, walks along the beach, a stop for lunch, and lots of practice in Spanish conversation, I soon gathered the common theme of the area. My corner of Catalonia thrived off of summer tourism from France, and I had found myself in the off season. Each destination I was shown was quickly qualified by the fact that, had I arrived in the summer, the place would look complete different: shop doors wide open, traffic stretching for miles, and tourists in every corner.!#@p!#@I don’t think I really mind it though. As much as I had lamented not being among most of my program members in Barcelona, I find myself in need of my own off season as well. For much of the last semester, my brain has felt stuffed and crowded and foggy, using all its efforts to maintain the same academic routine. Each time my friends and I discuss my first true brush with small town living, the recurring bit I’ve landed on is that, at the very least, I’ll find inner peace.!#@p!#@While this may be an exaggeration, taking myself out of my comfort zone often gifts me with a clearer vision of who I am at the present day. Away from home, the people I meet have no recollection of the version of me that was mortifyingly shy for most of my childhood— ”that’s odd, you don’t strike me as the very quiet type.” Here, when they offer me tomato salad at dinner, they have no idea that I’ve picked tomatoes off of everything I’ve eaten since I was little. Surrounded by people completely unaware of my predispositions, I learned that I actually enjoy them now. What a lovely idea— that each time I introduce myself to someone new, I get the opportunity to meet myself again.!#@p!#@I know this is a lot of big talk for someone who has barely spent 24 hours here, but I saw the same thing happen to me when I traveled alone to Boston for CPW,⁠02 , and when I spent my IAP⁠03 in Sao Paolo 04 last year. It’s why I’ll always be a big advocate for programs like MISTI,⁠05 or just independent travel in general.!#@p!#@Anyways, it’s getting late and I have to teach tomorrow (after I watch just one more episode of Money Heist). Perhaps I’ll write you again after I’ve gotten the chance to do some work with the school, or maybe even after my weekend trip to Barcelona. Whether that happens or not, thanks for reading, and I hope you’re doing well.!#@p!#@Sincerely,!#@p!#@Veronica!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2589-400x225.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-postcard-from-gtl-spain/

(Not) Home for the Holidays by Allison E. '27,a very late Thanksgiving post…,by Allison E. '27,"January 3, 2025","I’ve been home for winter break since last Sunday, and it’s been a flurry of many things, but second most importantly, it’s been a flurry of FOOD!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241224_181131-1-800x609.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241222_184148-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241228_115458-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241224_2130352-800x600.jpg]!#@In honor of holiday meals at home, I want to share a holiday meal away from home. Aka, it’s finally time to post my (extremely belated) Thanksgiving saga!!#@p!#@It is Thursday, November 28th.⁠01 Or, well, it will be when I post this (hopefully).⁠02 Another year, another Thanksgiving cooking post!!#@p!#@Sophomore fall has been busy for my friends & I, which has meant no more 12-person feasts on random weekends in the middle of the semester (very PNR-core). But! This Thanksgiving, most of us are on campus, so we’ve decided to remedy that in as overzealous a fashion as possible. I’m documenting this attempt in real time⁠03 , so today’s blog post is like Maxwell’s equations: it comes to you in 4 parts.!#@p!#@Part 1: The menu!#@p!#@I write from ye olden days of Tuesday, November 26th. Our spirit is indomitable, and our ambition knows no bounds. After 251 messages, 4 in-person scheming sessions, and a very chaotic spreadsheet, we’ve arrived at a (prospective) menu:!#@p!#@Is it cohesive? Nope. Do we care? Also nope.!#@p!#@As a food traditionalist, I insisted on some of the classic American Thanksgiving dishes–turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce. However, as someone who doesn’t actually like those foods that much (oops 🫣), I’m very happy that the rest of our repertoire is… not classic American LOL. Also, yes, the turkey will be precooked, and very small. We’re not ready to spend 8 hours screwing up a $40 turkey when most people don’t like turkey anyways 😭!#@p!#@Part 2: The shopping!#@p!#@It’s now Wednesday, November 27th, and we’ve finally finished gathering the ingredients… ‘Twas a long and arduous journey, tracing three corners of Boston, six grocery stores, an Uber grocery delivery and 11 man-hours. Nevertheless, we did it!!#@p!#@By the day before Thanksgiving, most of campus has already gone home, and classes are half-empty or cancelled. Nevertheless, work never ceases, and our grocery run didn’t begin until 5:00 pm. However, because our menu is an odd combination of traditional American Thanksgiving, various Asian cuisines, and a Hungarian cake, we had to hit several locations–Whole Foods for the pre-cooked turkey, H Mart⁠04 for the Asian ingredients, Star Market⁠05 for the niche ingredients, and Trader Joe’s for the cheapest prices.!#@p!#@Our crew of four shoppers split in two, with Arthur L. ‘27 and Benson L. ‘27 headed to H Mart and Miranda Z. ‘27 and I headed to Star Market. Miranda and I took the 1 Bus across the Charles River and stopped by a small Trader Joe’s along the way, just to gauge prices before actually buying things. Then we roamed the aisles of the gloriously large Star Market, searching for anything discounted.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241127_180230-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2869-800x1067.jpg]!#@After a moderately successful haul, we Ubered back to our dorm (yes, we’re lazy smh) to meet Arthur & Benson and shove our acquisitions in the fridge. Then, Benson and I set off for the final leg of the journey: Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.!#@p!#@The walk from Burton-Conner to Trader Joe’s is 25 minutes, but there’s a Bluebikes station⁠06 nearby and a nice bike lane heading straight there, so it’s only around 15 minutes! We rode the Bluebikes to Trader Joe’s and then walked to Whole Foods to pick up our turkey–which, apparently, was NOT small AT ALL. Oh well, not complaining!!#@p!#@Finally, one last stop for the rest of the grocery shopping–Trader Joe’s part 2–the much larger and better stocked Cambridge-side version.!#@p!#@SIKE!!#@p!#@This Trader Joe’s had NO EGGS. As in, none to speak of whatsoever. Not even $10 organic free range non-GMO grass fed calculus-proficient eggs 😭.⁠07 We also couldn’t find cocoa powder or heavy whipping cream, both of which Trader Joe’s consistently has. It was 8:30 pm. We still hadn’t eaten dinner. Everywhere was closing soon. *Panic*!#@p!#@This is where, as much as I hate to admit it, Uber delivery came to save the day… Armed with a handy 40% coupon, we put in an order for all the missing ingredients and headed back to Burton-Conner. Mission complete!!!#@p!#@Of course, this success meant a celebration was in order–next stop, dinner in Chinatown!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241127_215754-scaled-e1735721152439-1000x698.jpg]!#@Andddd then we Ubered back to campus, right? nOpE, it’s time for late night walks through Boston!!!#@p!#@… 2 hours, 3 playgrounds, and many shenanigans later …!#@p!#@Ok, finally sleep time. See y’all tomorrow!!#@p!#@Part 3: The cooking!#@p!#@Thanksgiving day has arrived–let the cooking begin!!#@p!#@SIKE AGAIN! The Uber grocery delivery did NOT include heavy whipping cream. Despite charging us for an even larger carton than we’d requested. So… off went Benson to Whole Foods (closed), CVS (no whipping cream), and Hmart (no whipping cream). Lesson learned–no last minute Thanksgiving shopping 😭. He ended up grabbing coconut milk as a substitute.!#@p!#@Nevertheless, we persevered. There were 16 dishes to cook, and 11 people to feed. Luckily, Csilla F. ‘27 lives in a large suite, and her suitemates were gone for the weekend, so we set up shop there (thank you Csillaaa). After stealing borrowing some extra tables, chairs, and cooking equipment from… locations, we set to work.!#@p!#@This isn’t our first rodeo, and by now we’ve mastered the art of parallelized cooking–there’s always a task for everyone, regardless of skill (which I don’t have much of). Chopping cucumbers, mashing potatoes, buttering corn, and most importantly, washing the neverending stream of dirty dishes!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241128_171030-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241128_180918-2-800x600.jpg]!#@Finally finally finally, after 6+ hours of cooking,⁠08 the feast was complete!! The final menu (slightly modified from the original) included turkey, braised pork, fried chicken, pork ribs, carbonara, mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh bread, corn on the cob, chinese cucumber salad, korean-style yu choy, gravy, apple pie, tres leches cake, coconut milk cake, and striped biscuits. pHew…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241128_1935512-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241128_201256-800x600.jpg]!#@Part 4: The aftermath!#@p!#@By the time dinner was finished, it was only 9:00 pm, and the night was still young! It was time for… a rager? Nope, time for an infernally difficult 1,000 piece puzzle !!!! Accompanied by at least 10 renditions of the song “APT.”, a bunch of silly dancing, and many shenanigans,⁠09 of course.!#@p!#@And then it was 2:00 am, and the puzzle wasn’t done. It didn’t help that the pieces are all funky, and we refused to look at the picture. And then it was 3:00 am, and the puzzle wasn’t done. And then it was 4:00 am. And then… FINALLY, at 5:00 am on the dot (I have timestamps), we put the last piece into the puzzle, and Thanksgiving was officially over!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241129_184157-1000x750.jpg]!#@We might not have been home for Thanksgiving, but we made a little piece of it for ourselves in Boston.

letter to my 2023 self by Janet G. '27,from: 2024 janet,by Janet G. '27,"January 2, 2025","I write two letters to myself at the end of every year. ⁠01 I write one to my future self who has experienced the upcoming year, and I write a response letter to my past self. I post the response letters publicly, and this year since I no longer have Instagram I thought I’d post it here!#@p!#@Dear 2023 Janet,!#@p!#@I’m responding to you from Toronto. That’s right — you’ll be relieved to hear that I’m actually travelling now, in contrast to last year’s misfortune. That’s a story that ends in two crutches, a sprained ankle, and a photo of us being shopping-carted to our 5.111 final.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image3-400x645.png]!#@I took advantage of our mobility this year: Nicole ⁠02 visited me from Cambridge, and we wandered around Boston and somehow managed to not freeze to death.⁠03 We took the wrong train but arrived in New York after some adventure, and now I’m in Toronto enjoying the exchange rate and the best hotpot I’ve ever had.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image5-400x300.png]!#@You wrote in your reflection last year that you grew a lot. You were an unrooted seedling who let the Pacific winds carry you over the oceans, through Auckland and Christchurch and Wellington and San Francisco, and plant you in Boston.⁠04 You went on so many adventures,⁠05 lived a crazy year, and relished the freedom that adulthood brought you.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image7.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image9.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image11.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image12.png]!#@It was a lot of fun and serendipity and fast-paced-ness and wild stories we’ll tell for years to come. What you didn’t say in the letter was that you were tired. Everyone was right: pushing a ‘Senior Summer’⁠06 and PNR semester to the utmost was an experience you did not regret. Still, it was a bit too much. You told me that you wanted to change.!#@p!#@Taking root and settling down is hard. There are little habits and New Year’s Resolutions you can promise yourself, but reality moves beyond happy-Instagram-snapshot-endings. We received a herb-growing kit as a Secret Santa gift last year. You wrote that you could take your experiences growing this cilantro and apply it to care for yourself in the same way, with water, nutrition, and sunlight. But after the new year, half of the herbs didn’t sprout, and the other half eventually died due to your disheartened lack of care. Life mirrors art: during IAP, ⁠07 you regressed into terrible sleeping habits and questionable food consumption methods and mentally withered one way or another.!#@p!#@Spring was still hard. Your workload came to a head and ultimately you made the tough choice to drop a club that you really, really cared about. Even before then, you had already dropped the ball twice and disappointed your friends. You’d told me that you wanted to be more academic and rigorous, and failing your first midterm of the semester felt like a slap in the face. You began questioning whether you belonged at this school. I know, I know — you had thought yourself too good to get imposter syndrome, because didn’t you work hard enough to achieve enough in high school to feel like you belonged here? — but only a lucky few have never doubted their place here, and you’re not special.!#@p!#@Not being special is okay. You grinded out evenings in the Stud⁠08 like everyone else, and got an A in that class despite the first midterm. You spent your summer doing research, and you had a great time doing the same thing as all your friends: cooking together, hanging out at libraries, and complaining about your lack of research progress. You learned that you can live more slowly.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image2.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image4.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image6-800x1067.jpg]!#@Moving slowly means seeing everything in higher resolution. The tails of shooting stars are just streetlights you’re speeding past; biology research was not the noble, groundbreaking adventure you hoped it would be. It’s still worth it, because you still learned a lot both about the practice and yourself. Culturing cells taught you a lot about patience and precision: two weeks may feel like a scary number, but really that’s just the time it takes to thaw another set of cells for new experiments. Changing cell media was one of the most stressful things we ever did, but boy was it satisfying when I saw that my cells are stretched out and lounging in the culture media. There is something noble, groundbreaking, and adventurous about the practice of research. It just might not come in the form that you imagined.!#@p!#@Of course, there’s nothing wrong with the occasional whimsy. You explored Stanford with friends and learned that the higher you go, the better the view gets. You flew to Pittsburgh on two weeks’ notice to see Nicole, ⁠09 to talk about perfumes and make bao buns. You went to London and Oxford with Claire ⁠10 for a camp, and we had so much fun meeting some of the coolest people ever and eating delicious food. The intensity of experience was similar to last summer, but the density was much more manageable, and you left feeling rejuvenated and content. You found a better balance.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image8-400x533.png]!#@Balance doesn’t mean complete equilibrium. Systems at complete equilibrium have zero energy; in biological terms, they’re dead. Sometimes you’ve got to let things take over your life. HackMIT is the best example of this, and we’ve written about that before. You’ve given your all to more things beyond Hack, and even if some things don’t work out — frankly, most of them didn’t — it’s okay because you learned and you loved and you lived.!#@p!#@I’m a sophomore now. We turned twenty in a surprise-but-not-really party, surrounded by many of the people we love most. You’ll be relieved to hear how a summer away doesn’t really change things. Your friends still remember, and all the little details of love manifest themselves in unexpected ways — the ice cream flavour they (try to) buy for you,⁠11 the chef’s knife he heard you raving about, a drawing of the bird you told her was your favorite.⁠12 Still, entering a new decade of my life hasn’t flipped a switch of maturity. I’m still fumbling along and making mistakes that I occasionally regret.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image10.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image1.png]!#@I’m also now on the blogs! We applied again and got in. Yes, sometimes if you try again you can get lucky, and applying again was one of the best decisions I made this year. I love the community (yay <3), and I’m honestly glad that we had time to live some life at MIT without putting all of it online, so it all worked out.!#@p!#@Don’t worry, I still remember all the things you wanted to tell the 2022 Janet who obsessively browsed the blogs every other day as a coping mechanism. I’ve attached it below.!#@p!#@Dear 2022 Janet,!#@p!#@I know that life sucks right now. You’re still tweaking out over the fact that none of your essays feel fully finished and you’re currently hyperfixating on even the punctuation you’re using because you’re worried that the AOs will think you’re stupid or annoying or whatever else.!#@p!#@It does get better. You will get into the school that you were afraid to admit was your dream. You thought for the longest time that MIT was the one school that was impossible, so you didn’t even decide to apply until the last week of December. You’ve since learned the lesson of giving things a shot anyway, and it paid off. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows — in fact, most of the time the weather is sus and you’re miserable and tired — but you could not imagine a better community to grow in.!#@p!#@But hey — even if you hadn’t gotten in, things would’ve been okay. The worst moments in your life always occurred the last day before big tests. At this point everything is largely out of your control, but you still have to sprint in those last moments, to try and shift the probability a little more in your favour. The moment you submit those applications, everything will be over, and for the first time in your life you will have closed a significant chapter.!#@p!#@Uncertainty is scary. You don’t know the future self writing to you, and you’re worried that none of it will work out. That’s out of your hands; trust that the person you’ll become is strong enough to turn around and tell you that you’ll be okay, and she will become that person for you. All you need to do is to push through these last few days and try your best.!#@p!#@Tomorrow your family will ask you to visit a mountain with them. You will hesitate because you feel like you should look over your application one more time and pray that you will get into the schools that you want. You will make the right choice and go with them, because you need to breathe and remember that there is more to life than essays. There are also the winding roads of the New Zealand countryside, the Pōhutukawa in full summer bloom, and the winds turning the windmills in the distance. One day these winds will blow you over the Pacific, to places thousands of miles away, where your family has still never been but supported you to go regardless. In the meantime you will sit shotgun as your dad complains about the poor design decisions of the road, and you will doze off in the lull of the drive.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image13-400x533.png]!#@We have not been back since. It doesn’t matter, because even if we do visit, we will see the house as a stranger. 2022 Janet, I want you to go to sleep now — it’s 2am when you finish your letter — and wake up tomorrow, and take in as much of the December summer as possible. I want you to grumble a little less when the parentals knock on your door in the morning; I want you to tell them that yes, really, the outing was fun. You were fine with the drive being so long — in fact, you wished it would last a little longer.!#@p!#@The heart is a sticky thing. Telling yourself that “home is where the heart is” doesn’t always feel helpful; there’s a home in New Zealand, in MIT, in all the friends who you have come to love. It means that you are always simultaneously at home and homesick. I know that a sense of belonging felt impossible when you had to move through so many places so quickly, when it felt like you barely had a chance to take root in one place before moving on. Feeling stuck trying to hold onto so many things at once is not fun.!#@p!#@Seriously, though — it’ll be okay! In 2024, you will learn to savour life. You will take long walks by the river, letting your roots gradually stretch out and capture those cities in your memory. We can hold onto many things beyond cities too: the cacophony of an off-key birthday chorus, the conversations that you marinate on for days, the trace of their face in the moonlight. These moments will stay with you as you live on, and the journey forward will be a little less daunting.!#@p!#@Love,!#@p!#@2024 Janet!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image3-400x645.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image5-400x300.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image7.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image9.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image11.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image12.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image2.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image4.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image6-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image8-400x533.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image10.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image1.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image13-400x533.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/letter-to-my-2023-self/
everything i made this year by Gloria Z. '26,(mostly),by Gloria Z. '26,"January 1, 2025","Wow I haven’t blogged in one million years! I feel like I’ve written many stubs and snippets over the past few months, but I haven’t been able to push any of them over the finish line, mostly due to lack of time and mental space. In an effort to record at least some of what happened this year, I’m writing this blog, which includes…!#@p!#@First, the things I made this year, including but not limited to textiles, paintings, and posters. As we round out 2024, I wanted to audit my creative output this year, in order to 1) see what actually happened and 2) figure out what I want to focus on making next year. To summarize my thoughts in a sentence, I would say that this was a year of trying new mediums and materials, sometimes at the cost of letting old skills atrophy.!#@p!#@The second part of this blog is about, more abstractly, the decisions I made this year. I feel like many parts of my life began to shift and settle into place, if only on the surface, and I’ve been thinking a lot about my career, work-life balance, creativity, and how different it is to work than to be a student. More on these things further down the blog, though, and we can start first with:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/05-800x600.jpg]!#@I made this book, “Conversations for Beginners,” for 4.s00⁠01 , a design class I took in the spring about translated typography. Modeled after language-learning pamphlets such as “101 Spanish Conversations for Beginners,” it attempts to parody, pick apart, and find comfort in the patterns of everyday conversation. The book includes a set of ten “translated” conversations whose rules, contents, and usage are laid out visually and instructionally; it was assembled from laser-cut and spray-painted chipboard and is meant to be taken apart, overlaid on top of itself, and reassembled by the user.!#@p!#@What the title says! Over IAP, I participated in a blanket quilting workshop⁠02 , and now I teach weekly quilting workshops in Metropolis⁠03 .!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_7021-2-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4799-4.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0547-4-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0404-1-800x800.jpg]!#@Over the summer, I also decided to join a local weaving circle back home in California, to learn a new skill and keep myself occupied through the long summer days. What I didn’t expect was that the group was populated entirely by retired grandmothers (though in hindsight… maybe not that surprising). One of the women hosted the circle in her sun-drenched Berkeley backyard, and it was so lovely to soak in the weather, thread bits of yarn through warp and weft, and listen to them catch everyone up each week about their grandchildren, travel plans, and latest weaving projects. I feel like I rarely interact with people in that stage of life, and it was strangely comforting to hear about the mundanities and excitements of their daily lives (and to tell them about mine!).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4321-9.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4323.jpg]!#@I meant to blog about this project right after we “finished” it at the end of January, but then the rush of the semester started and it was just kind of over (plus we didn’t get around to taking nice pictures of it until literally May). Nevertheless, here it is in all its glory – a pen plotter, drawing machine, robot, whatever you want to call it, with 5 degrees of freedom (aka it can move the brush pen it’s holding in the x, y, z, pitch, and yaw axes).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-carriagecloseup-3-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-fullbody-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-created-drawing-1-800x1325.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-screen-2.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/05-yaw-2-800x450.jpg]!#@We made this over IAP with the help of a independent project grant! The idea was to make a machine that could replicate and draw calligraphic strokes. However, speedrunning this project in one month⁠04 while we both had other things like UROPs going on was not the most realistic idea, and Lee and I were only able to finish the mechatronic parts of the project by the end of IAP. Here’s a timelapse of it running some hardcoded paths–it’s kind of hard to see, but the carriage is moving up and down to vary the stroke width of the brush pen, moving multiple axes at the same time, etc. In particular, the variable width ovals require simultaneous movements in x, y, z, and yaw.!#@p!#@We also realized that generating/extracting a five-dimension calligraphy stroke path is, like, a whole other project in and of itself. All things considered, I’m really proud of what we grinded out, especially with basically no electronics experience going in (which you can probably tell from the massive electronics board that should have just been a pcb). It was a great learning experience, fueled by many late nights in the Metropolis electronics mezzanine and Hershey’s dark chocolates.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-wiring-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-carriage-cad-800x600.jpg]!#@Painting and drawing are my bread and butter mediums, so I ended up with a good amount of sketchbook pages over the course of 2024. However, in the middle of the spring semester, my iPad decided to randomly turn off and never turn on again, and I lost over four years of Procreate files (the digital drawing app I use). I had fortunately exported and saved most of the completed paintings I liked, but it still sucked a lot to lose what was essentially my sketchbook since high school.!#@p!#@An unexpected yet welcome consequence of this, though, was that I began to fall back in love with physical mediums over the summer. This was also because I was back at home in my childhood room, where I had left allll my art supplies back in 2022, from old dried up acrylic paints to wads of felt to, for some reason, a bag of 20+ oil pastel sticks all in the same color. It was a fun time :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-fishgouache-800x629.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-goose-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-oilpastel-800x800.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/06-travel2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/08-life-painting-printmaking-800x600.jpg]!#@As the fall semester came into view, I traded in my iPad carcass for a smaller, more lightweight version (12.9”->11”), redownloaded Procreate, and started painting digitally again. I’m especially proud of these ones:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-monterey_bay_aquarium-800x640.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-iceland-landscape-800x400.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-mapcrunch-800x482.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-stickersheet-800x782.png]!#@I feel like I stepped away from painting and drawing in the past year, as newer, more exciting mediums took the spotlight, but I really want to return to them in the upcoming year. I don’t think I’ve necessarily gotten worse, but I have felt a lot of my core rendering and composition skills start to dissipate. Basically.. I need to get back on the grind 🏃!#@p!#@So I actually started this back in fall/winter of 2023, but I’m listing it here because I “finished” it in 2024. And by finished I mean I forgot what cone⁠05 of clay I used for it – evidently, a lower one than 6, because when we tried glaze firing the piece at cone 6, it promptly melted into a puddle of burnt clay. I’m glad I got these nice pictures of it before that, though, and at least now I don’t have to figure out where to store it :’).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bust_fountain_sculpture-16-800x1013.jpg]!#@It’s a fountain, and the shards of stained glass in the base and breasts were supposed to anneal in the kiln to resemble water.

Instead, when Infinite or Gala needed graphics made, I kind of just scrambled to put something together in Illustrator.

However, the definition of “camera” was used quite loosely in this class, and we were encouraged to think more broadly about technologies involving the use of image capture, environmental sensing, etc. Interested in the ideas of 1) producing physical media through digital methods and 2) gamification, Teresa and I made this! It’s kind of hard to explain, but basically it’s an instant camera that prints out your image on thermal paper, combined with a DDR-style light matching game; how well the user plays determines how denoised their output image is.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01-hero-1-800x450.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02-buttons-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03-electronics-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-prototypes-1-800x450.jpg]!#@The printed images are pretty low-res, partly because the Arduino Mega doesn’t have enough memory to store the entire output of the camera module, partly because the thermal printer can only do either black or white output for each pixel. They look pretty cool printed out though, and are sometimes recognizable as real objects.

Back in 2022, I had entered MIT as a wide-eyed freshman, freshly graduated from four years of high school robotics, so naturally, I picked the major that seemed best adapted to making robots: mechanical engineering! After taking and soundly enjoying 2.003 and 2.004⁠11 , I felt affirmed in my decision to be a roboticist, and went on to take 6.4200⁠12 in the spring, a project-based class that simultaneously took years off my lifespan and instilled in me even more determination to pursue robotics.!#@p!#@However, over this past summer and fall semester, I felt my interest in robotics wane. This was partly due to my experience at my summer job, where I worked on path planning algorithms at an autonomous vehicle company (which are kind of just massive mobile robots). On paper, this sounds really cool, and I was super excited to get started, but I found that the work in practice was much less exciting than the work in theory. This is largely out of necessity – software that’s going to be deployed on real-life self-driving cars needs to undergo rigorous, lengthy testing, because the consequences could be dire (aka collisions). However, I found that the majority of my time was spent tweaking small variables, running tests, and generally feeling somewhat detached from the work I was doing. This might have just been how things work at this particular organization, and I’m sure things are different at other robotics-y companies, but the experience did help burst the robot-shaped bubble I had constructed around myself for the past two years.!#@p!#@[There were other reasons for this burst as well – first, that many (not all, but many) robotics and autonomy companies in the US work with the US military/DoD in some way, a cause that I’m not personally willing to work for; and second, that cutting-edge robotics research is increasingly focused on AI and learning-based methods, and I am unfortunately not very interested in AI.]!#@p!#@But, now that I had taken a step back from idealizing robotics, I could turn and face an overarching feeling I’ve had during my time at MIT – a slow drifting away from science and engineering. To contextualize this, though, we’ve got to go back to 2021…!#@p!#@When I was applying to colleges in senior year of high school, I very seriously considered going to an art school for illustration or graphic design. I had split my time in high school half and half between engineering and the arts, and I felt very strongly about both–but after getting into MIT, there was almost no question that I would attend, for a few reasons. First, there’s no denying the prestige and stability that come with a degree from MIT, and although these things may not be as important in the long run, to a 17-year old, they were important – and even more so to my parents, who had, in large part, come to this country so that I could have them. Second, I did truly love STEM, a core part of my identity at that point; and third, I hadn’t gotten into those top art programs that I wanted, and it was, by all means, a blow to my creative confidence. So I bought a MIT crewneck off Ebay, signed my letter, and it was off to CPW.!#@p!#@I truly love MIT and, looking back, I feel like it was the right decision for me. I’ve learned so much, met so many amazing (amazing!!) people here, and got to try things and access resources I wouldn’t have been able to anywhere else. I’d never take my experiences here for granted. At the same time, many decisions can be “right,” just different, and often I find myself wondering how things would be if I had stepped in another direction. Although paths are never really set in stone, I know that my decision two years ago opened up many doors to me, while simultaneously closing and locking many others.!#@p!#@Now that I’m a junior, I feel a (perhaps unfounded) sense that more doors are closing; some of the figs are falling from the tree, and I need to start thinking about what I really want. This feeling intensified as I watched my peers (both my age and older) make life decisions™: one of my friends dropped out this year to pursue their startup; another went to Taiwan for grad school; yet another decided to accept a full-time job offer and graduate a year early. As for me, my indecision lies in what to study in grad school, if at all, and subsequently pursue as a career. I’ve dropped the idea of seeking robotics research roles, but I’m torn between pursuing something completely creative or something purely technical or something somewhere in between. I’ve heavily considered pivoting to architecture, or staying for my masters at MIT, or trying to become one of those people who makes huge suspended airport installations (??). This semester, I changed my major from 2A-6 to a double major in 6-4 (computer science) and 4-B (design); for now, I’m trying to keep as many doors open as possible.!#@p!#@Although I felt more lost than ever this semester, having let go of the robotic goal I’d bound myself to, I also felt a deep sense of clarity. I know a few things to be true – that I love art, that I love engineering for a purpose, that I love making things with others, and that, ultimately, you end up becoming yourself. And so based on these facts, I’ve made some of those decisions I mentioned earlier. First, in my final three semesters, the majority of the classes I’m taking are design and architecture studios and humanities classes, with the rest solely there to fulfill my graduation requirements. Second, that I’ll pursue grad school of some kind, both to deepen my skillset and to learn more about what’s even possible career-wise. And third, that I ultimately want to end up doing something arts-oriented and impactful on the world, but I’m okay with taking the long way around, maybe working in a more technical field first to build up savings, or working in an adjacent field to build up life and work experience.!#@p!#@And of course there are a lot of other things besides pure enjoyment that go into career decisions: financial viability (!), purported impact on the world, flexibility of work hours and location, and opportunities for growth and advancement. However, I’ve spent much of the last few years doing mental gymnastics to convince myself that I want to be a software or mechanical engineer, and it’s revelatory to hold the truth up in plain sight, that art is what makes me feel connected to myself, others, and the world in a way that few other things do. I don’t feel fear of failure and imposter syndrome in engineering in the same way I do when it comes to creative work, and I think that says something; I know that in the end, I’ll figure out a way to circle back into the arts, however that manifests, and that’s enough of a north star in the night sky for now.

But nonetheless, we balled anyway.!#@p!#@In total, I had four finals to prepare for after the last day of classes on Wednesday the 11th:!#@p!#@Now my biggest opp in this war was chemistry simply because I and that subject don’t have any, so in the same way Aiden imprisoned himself in building 4 to study for physics, I holed myself up in our dorm’s multipurpose room the day following the last day of classes and started brain-dumping everything I could remember from that subject on two large whiteboards. I then made a list of stuff to review that I couldn’t rewrite from memory and after doing this I started to realize that this method really helped me draw the line between what I did and didn’t know in a class so I ended up doing the same thing for all the other classes I had finals for and at some point I started to feel like a maniac who was just scribbling non-sense equations on a wall.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_7631-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5890-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6019-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5996-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5998-800x1067.jpg]!#@So anyways:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6028-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6031-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6038-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6076-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6075-800x1067.jpg]!#@Tuesday was two finals back to back.

So after a quick Dunkin’ trip, I walked back to my dorm and started packing while enjoying my newfound freedom accompanied by my favorite music.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6212-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6221-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6228-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6260-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6269-800x1067.jpg]!#@So the Uber arrived around 2:30ish and I and the three other friends I rode with got to the airport around 3ish. So from there we all took a group photo together and headed our separate ways into our different terminals. Took me about half an hour to get through TSA and reach my gate and from there I just chilled and listened to music for some hours while waiting for my plane.  And it was once I got in my seat that I decided to take time and really reflect on all that had happened this past semester.!#@p!#@In the span of four months, I had done so many new things and met so many new and amazing people. I took classes that really tested my limits but also took classes that reminded me why I enjoyed learning in the first place. I found spaces and mentors that have helped me to continue exploring my goals and passions here on campus. I learned a lot about myself, the ways I learn, the ways I deal with stress, and the ways I interact with others. And despite how challenging it all felt, I’m just really glad to have found a way to grow from everything this semester and really look forward to taking all these lessons into my future semesters here.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6286-scaled.jpg]!#@I’ll see yall in May/June for the end of this trilogy.

new york without i*stagram by Janet G. '27,who are you performing for?,by Janet G. '27,"December 29, 2024","i’m starting this entry at an airport at 5am. sometimes waking up way too early for a flight has its benefits: you get to sit in an airport, people watch, and reflect on how you should compensate for your irresponsible spending by writing a blog.!#@p!#@i was in new york over the past few days (mainly for christmas), and due to a mixture of factors both within and outside my control, i had an overall pretty mid time. it wasn’t awful, but considering how much all of my friends raved about this city i was pretty disappointed with my experience here.!#@p!#@i’ll get the hate out of my system first. i’ll preface it by saying that this is my very biased personal take, subject to change blah blah blah!#@p!#@midtown manhattan⁠01 is the epitome of late stage capitalism, and you could take that as either a compliment or an insult depending on your personal philosophies. personally, i find it a little comical that one of the most famous attractions in the city is a set of massive advertisement billboards.!#@p!#@i dislike that the big draw of this city is to find different ways to spend a lot of money. everywhere is extremely crowded,⁠02 people are always tense and hurried, and you have to watch your step to avoid stepping in some trash-filled puddle every few minutes. even the rich pieces of culture felt underwhelming and couldn’t improve my opinion of the place. at some point, the beautiful pieces of the Met start conflating into one glittery blur and you start thinking about how you could probably estimate the number of lives it took to make these extravagant jewellery pieces.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6561.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6614.jpg]!#@broadway was very well produced, and while it was cool to see some big names live, i didn’t like the numbers of this musical⁠03 and thus couldn’t ignore the underdevelopment of plot and characters that felt jarring to me.!#@p!#@with all of that said, there is something iconic about new york that doesn’t allow you to fully hate it. there’s an infectious sense of wonder when you’re wandering the streets and see everyone dressed up in their best fits and beaming at the camera. there’s always a lot of energy in the streets. complaints about the Met and Broadway aside, they are some of the most iconic places in the world for a reason. you couldn’t find another museum that was as extensive and well-curated — every exhibit was placed with care and intention, it would take me years to get through and understand the richness of every piece of history there. as much as the musical numbers failed to latch onto me, the dances and set was still fantastic, the song delivery was powerful and incredibly clear, and i’m not sure when else i’d get a chance to have jordan fisher be literally less than 4 feet away from me.!#@p!#@i also enjoyed walking through central park,⁠04 grabbing a lox bagel at liberty bagels despite the lines and price, and seeing the new york skyline at the rockefeller center.⁠05 new york city is The City, after all, and there are some things you should just tick off for the sake of it.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6549.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6610-1.jpg]!#@knowing what you personally enjoy while travelling is important. travelling without an express purpose — without my family or other people planning my itinerary — forces you to think about your own desires rather than what your parents/team leaders want. the most interesting conclusion i gained from this trip is that not having instagram has really changed what i want.!#@p!#@for context, i deactivated my accounts sometime in the fall semester. there are really valid use cases for instagram: staying in touch with friends, stalking your crush’s tagged posts and occasionally trying to send them a reel for no reason at all, proving to your haters that you’re living a better life than them with your matcha latte at the cutest coffee shop ever, so on so forth. i just primarily used mine to send my friends deranged memes and post unhinged stories about my transport debacles. one day i decided that this was not worth it and decided to leave and never go back.!#@p!#@during the semester i was mostly too busy to realise the impact that no instagram had on me. being in new york gave me a lot of whiplash — after all, is this not the most instagrammable city of all time? i grabbed my rainbow lox bagel and after taking a bite of it first,⁠06 i took a photo and paused for a moment as i realised that i was trying to get the perfect lighting to show how beautiful the cross-section was. but like, why was i doing that? it’s not like i was going to post this on instagram to prove that i went to a cute place with a cute bagel. i also personally care about the taste of the bagel much more than the appearance, and the rainbow bagel just literally looks good.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6601-400x533.jpg]!#@the same thing happened everywhere else i went. realising that i no longer had to perform for some imaginary audience forced me to confront why i cared about the perfect photo. for some contexts, this still mattered; i think it’s totally valid to want to create and keep the best memento of your experience at certain places. if i had to pay like 50 dollars to go stand in the wind above a bunch of light pollution then my photos better be good. but also i realised that for some places it’s just not worth it — times square felt like a spectacle meant for the optimised instagram algorithm; the bright lights are supposed to capture your attention as you apathetically tap through a bunch of stories.!#@p!#@i like not having instagram. it means that i have to work harder to prove to myself why i want certain kinds of life experiences, beyond the idea of “i can make a post on instagram and get some gratifying likes”. maybe this takes the fun away from many decisions, such as why i decided to take a $3 premium to get the rainbow bagel over the NYT-recommended everything bagel. but also, maybe this means that the next time i come back to new york, i can go visit places i know i actually want, rather than places i feel like i should go for some experience that i was replicating based on everyone else’s curated stories. i no longer have instagram as a sample set anyway.!#@p!#@in some ways, i felt the same incentive structure when it came to writing my college application essays. i framed myself as a very specific kind of person so that i could draw attention to myself in the hopes that the admission officers would notice me and admit me. i mean, it worked. but what i also found very useful was to look at my essays and ask myself, what do i actually want? is this an authentic version of myself? and maybe this is a question you should answer after your college application season is over, because you just really need to get your essays out before the looming deadline and you’re stressed. but most of my favourite essays that i wrote — essays that i specifically wrote for specific schools because the prompts spoke to me — come from a place of authenticity. don’t be afraid to write about something that you feel like doesn’t fit your portfolio or narrative that you’re trying to build.!#@p!#@one of the best pieces of writing advice that i got from my short stories professor last semester was that “every good piece of writing has some piece of a beating heart inside”. for every school i was admitted to i could point to one or two essays that i wrote exclusively for them because i really liked their prompt. don’t get me wrong — there’s a practice amongst people to copy and paste essays with minimal edits for multiple schools, and i think you should know that this is a reasonable and often necessary practice to make sure that you don’t go insane applying to too many schools at once. especially if you’re still looking at schools to apply to, you should most definitely do this copy-pasting thing so that you can toss your hat into the rng ring.!#@p!#@but i encourage you to not worry about the idea of trying to make the AO admit you — to take off the instagram-style filter of “would my audience like this and give me some gratifying likes?” — and engage directly with the prompts and stories yourself. what do these prompts mean to you? what is the story that you want to tell?!#@p!#@i also highly recommend this essay for you to procrastinate on if you’re stressed about writing. the tl;dr is that you could consider my thoughts above as advice on how to write your college essays, but you could also consider the reverse of my advice, which is basically that you should not be too authentic. maybe not everyone wants to hear about your crippling addiction to genshin impact because you wanted that specific ganyu skin, and instead they want to hear you explain why you actually wanted to lead the n-th nonprofit teaching kids maths in the area.!#@p!#@i’ll close off by saying that i know this period is rough, and i’m sorry you’re still stuck in this sense of limbo. i fondly remember the two weeks before college applications were due to be the worst two weeks of my life (hyperbole), and i did a lot of coping because i was stressed out and overthought about how my life was contingent on some random guy’s 5 minute skim and the sandwich they ate that day.⁠07 here were some of my favourite ways to destress during trying times:!#@p!#@hoping everyone has a good holiday season!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6561.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6614.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6549.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6610-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6601-400x533.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/new-york-without-istagram/
how i (kinda) studied for finals by Aiden H. '28,"brought to you by ""a PNR mindset""",by Aiden H. '28,"December 22, 2024","If you are reading this, it means I am successfully on my way out of Boston after surviving my first MIT finals season. The verdict? Lukewarm.!#@p!#@As has been explained a million times and will be a million more, MIT freshman have ~PNR~ their first semester. This means all classes are reported as either Pass (for what would be an A, B, or C⁠01 ) or No Record, implying that it isn’t reported on your transcript at all (for what would be a D or F).!#@p!#@There are a few existing camps of advice on how to abuse your PNR experience:!#@p!#@Above all us, every upperclassman has one piece of advice: enjoy it.!#@p!#@Naturally, a mental battle began the first week of classes. Will my laziness and desire to have fun allow me to fully utilize PNR, or will my need for academic validation win? As with everything, it was somewhere in the middle, and that couldn’t be more clearly shown than my entirely sporadic and vibes-based⁠02 study schedule for finals.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@THE LAST WEEK OF CLASSES!#@p!#@Monday – Calculate the Scores I Need to Pass!#@p!#@So far, I haven’t really locked in with the full PNR mindset. I did every pset for every class and never skipped lecture unless I had a genuine conflict⁠03 . My exam scores had been fine and getting better, but nothing so cracked that I didn’t have to take my finals.!#@p!#@Like every master procrastinator, instead of just starting to study and trying to do well, I immediately decided it would be best to spend an hour doing phone-app math to find my current grades in classes and decide what I would need to NR a class.!#@p!#@The situation (aka scores needed to pass):
5.111⁠04 – 40.16%!#@p!#@8.01⁠05 – like a 50? no one knows!#@p!#@17.41⁠06 – 9.17%!#@p!#@18.02⁠07 – 29.63%!#@p!#@8.01 has a policy where your have exams have to pass an undecided “exam average”. I assumed the worst it would be was a 70 (since I think that’s the lowest they can make passing?) and moved on.!#@p!#@From these I decided I was chilling and ended up not worrying for days until the anxiety eventually crept up.!#@p!#@Tuesday & Wednesday – Procrastinate!#@p!#@To be fair, these were the last two days of classes so it’s not as if I did nothing, I just didn’t do anything except go to class for like two hours (oops!).!#@p!#@I did print out the 8.01 exam equation sheet to try and convince myself to study, but using a printer is hard so I decided that was enough mental effort towards physics for one afternoon.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241210_181906-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241210_181913-800x1067.jpg]!#@Thursday – Begin to Freak Out!#@p!#@Thursday was the first day we didn’t have classes, so I aptly decided it was time to begin the cram for 8.01. The professors released a disgusting amount of practice problems, so I started by doing 5 that they released specifically as “past exam problems”.!#@p!#@At a certain point I can’t stand to sit at my desk chair in my dorm anymore, so I search for an empty classroom across campus to study in instead.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241212_165620-400x300.jpg]!#@These problems were, to say the least, not reassuring in my ability to pass the final! I ended up having to look at the solutions for help on all problems to varying degrees, so I starred the problems as ones I needed to redo later.!#@p!#@I after I left the classroom, I went back to my room for a “break”, which meant I accidentally watched nothing on YouTube for 3 hours, went to dinner, and then went to bed!!#@p!#@Friday – 8.01 Review!#@p!#@After my Thursday-night failure, I decided to get up early⁠08 to go into Boston and escape campus. I went to the Tatte at Copley Square,⁠09 bought the most delicious, obnoxious looking salad you’ve ever seen, and started watching the four hour review video for 8.01.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241213_113435-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241213_113439-800x1067.jpg]!#@After about two hours in Tatte, I went to the Boston Public Library reading room in hopes that the pretty architecture and 200 students suffering with me would better my spirits. I finished the review video and started doing the rest of the practice problems.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-22-at-2.02.33 PM-400x220.png]!#@Once I got back to Maseeh,⁠10 I ended up on the phone calling random people I know all night, so I spent another evening not studying 👍.!#@p!#@Saturday – Remember You Have Other Classes!#@p!#@Saturday was a fever dream. This was the day I fell victim to rotting at my desk doing practice problems all day. I begrudgingly opened MITx⁠11 and did more physics practice problems.!#@p!#@You would think that the last weekend of the semester would be crazy and fun and exciting, but instead it was desk and physics and more desk.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241214_215949-400x300.jpg]!#@I of course grew bored and angered at physics after a couple hours, so I decided I would start studying for the other exams I had not even 24 hours after the 8.01 exam. Quizlet dropped a beta version of their new game, so I played Blocks™ to review the ~150 terms I needed for my 17.41 exam. 5.111 also posted the review video for the session I did not go to, so I opened the tab, said I was going to watch it, and then didn’t watch it.!#@p!#@Sunday – Give Up!#@p!#@I mean can you blame me? Sunday I was unmotivated and tired, so I glanced over equations for a while, but I pretty much just read and went to be early.

parallel universe by Kai V. '25,for those feeling dejected,by Kai V. '25,"December 19, 2024","Text transcript:!#@p!#@Many times this semester, I felt disappointed in myself. It’s not a new sensation. But after all these years, I still don’t have any advice, just a feeling. A long, cold plummet into guilt and shame over a failure that feels misunderstood by others, and an emergence into a slightly parallel universe: one where everything remains the same, except for the wet sheen of dejection, weighing upon you alone.!#@p!#@But – look up – this parallel universe is also one where art transports you elsewhere, if only for a few hours; one where a weekend trip with friends makes you feel whole again; one where you are learning and growing all the time; one where you try new things and expand your sense of what is possible; one where the future still stretches out ahead of you, opaque, diffuse, waiting to be molded into reality.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/parallel-universe/
MIT Early Action Decisions Now Available Online by Chris Peterson SM '13,,by Chris Peterson SM '13,"December 17, 2024","MIT Early Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2029 are now available in the application portal.

There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update.!#@p!#@This year, 12,053 students applied early to the MIT Class of 2029, and as of *checks watch* right now, we have offered early admission to 721. Though they are all different in their own way —  mechanics and muralists, plantdads and playwrights, tenors and tinkerers  — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s mission to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to campus to join the 4,535 outstanding undergraduates already enrolled at MIT.!#@p!#@We deferred 7486 applicants;⁠ these students will be reconsidered without prejudice in Regular Action, with decisions released sometime in March.

This decision has been made with care, and it is final. I know this can be a difficult decision to receive, but trust me: it works out okay in the end. Take a deep breath, shake it out, and go crush the rest of your college applications (or whatever else you choose to do) this year.!#@p!#@The balance of our applicants —  807 —  withdrew from our process before we issued their decision.!#@p!#@We recognize it’s a lot of effort for all of you to apply to MIT.

simfinite hopscotch! by Ellie F. '28,hippity hoppity blue tape grandiosity,by Ellie F. '28,"December 15, 2024","MIT is about risk. It’s a place where you put yourself out there, face possible criticism, to realize your full potential. In my case, I sent my very first email to dormspam, a mailing list that reaches most of the undergrad population, making myself vulnerable to starting a flame war (or worse!!). This was all in order to reach my highest goal, my dream: to make a hopscotch down Vassar St, or the Simfinite. Anyways, here’s the email I pored over for so long.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/dormspam-1000x469.png]!#@I ordered a 64 pack of chalk, which would definitely be enough, unless someone got really hungry. Around 2pm, my roommate, a few other friends, and I descended to begin the odyssey. We started brewing up strategies, designating some people to squares, and others to numbers. I was on number duty, and as it turns out, counting upwards is pretty damn hard. What comes after 33? My roommate Anoushka and I agreed that there’s literally no way to tell.!#@p!#@About an hour in, the ogs had to leave, but a revolving door of chalkers started helping out. I made peace with the dust that would forevermore inhabit my mouth and throat. We started running out of chalk faster than free food disappears on campus. Still, we kept the sad chalky nubs of what had been to decorate milestone squares like 100, and then 200, and then 300, and then…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/chalk-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/chalk-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/chalk-3-800x600.jpg]!#@In the 800s, we encountered a dilemma. Should we continue down Vassar St., or cross to the other side, where most students turn towards the Z Center? After holding court, the jury decided to cross.

After basically doing squats nonstop for so long, I declined hopping it for the time being.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, the rain washed our creation away just three days later.

Josh wants to note that one week after his purchase, the price of blue tap doubled, so clearly the sellers realized the true worth of their product.!#@p!#@It took a while to figure out a good taping time, but about a month after the original hopscotch, we got together on a Sunday morning and started work. It went much slower than chalk, but we got into a groove much faster this time.

Blogger Wrapped 2024 by Andi Q. '25,Episode 7: The Apple Music Awakens,by Andi Q. '25,"December 14, 2024","Oh boy, it’s finally here! Everyone’s favorite time of the year that we’ve all been awaiting anxiously for so long…!#@p!#@The fall final exam period at MIT!!#@p!#@wait… that’s not quite right…!#@p!#@Uhh, the weekend before EA decisions release!!#@p!#@hmm… not that either…!#@p!#@I meant, it’s time for the annual Blogger Wrapped, where we expose our music tastes for the internet to judge (and help you take a break from thinking about those previous two things)!!#@p!#@The other bloggers were kind enough to let me make this post this year. Probably because this year’s Spotify Wrapped content is somewhat… lacking in substance (what is Spotify Wrapped if I can’t find out which random European town matches my music taste 😔). But Gangnam Style is finally not one of my top five songs this year, so I’m at least happy about that.!#@p!#@Here are the previous editions of Blogger Wrapped if you’re interested: 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018.!#@p!#@But without further ado…!#@p!#@In 2024, the MIT Admissions bloggers listened to 686,742 minutes of music on Spotify, Apple Music, and *checks notes* YouTube Music. For reference, there are 525,600 minutes in a year.!#@p!#@Congratulations to Angie and Janet for being our most avid listeners this year, with 89,029 minutes and 86,156 minutes respectively on Spotify (about 2 months nonstop each)! On the other end of the spectrum, we have Allison and Emiko (the two non-Spotify bloggers who filled out this part of my survey) with 13,471 minutes and 20,629 minutes respectively – no doubt a result of their cursed non-Spotify platforms.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-800x624.png]!#@Just like last year, Gloria put us all to shame in the number of songs she listened to, with over 1.5x more unique songs than the next highest person (me). And it looks like even though Emiko didn’t spend much time listening to music, she listened to a diverse range of songs.!#@p!#@But when comparing the number of artists we listened to, I managed to pull slightly ahead of Gloria. It’s probably because I mostly listen to orchestral music, and Spotify often lists at least three different artists for those pieces.!#@p!#@Unsurprisingly, Angie once again tops the rankings for the most minutes spent listening to a single artist, with an impressive 132-day listening streak for The Smiths. That’s almost 7x longer than the next longest streak: Aiden’s 19-day listening streak for Taylor Swift! Veronica also makes a surprise appearance near the top of the rankings here, even though Apple Music apparently stops collecting data near October.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-3-800x585.png]!#@Specific top artists for each blogger:!#@p!#@Moving on to top songs, Jebby easily takes the crown here with 503 streams of Lithonia by Childish Gambino. Angie said she fell asleep to No. 1 Party Anthem playing on repeat twice, but even that was not enough to place her in the top three. (Surprisingly, No. 1 Party Anthem is not a song by The Smiths! Scandalous, I know…)!#@p!#@Specific top songs for each blogger:!#@p!#@Fun fact: Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish was the song that appeared most in the bloggers’ top-five lists. It features in Aiden’s, Kai’s, Veronica’s, and Kano’s lists.!#@p!#@Shout out to Kano for spending almost 20 hours one day listening to Spotify. Hang in there – the semester is almost over.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-5-800x572.png]!#@Here are everyone’s top fives (artists and songs) wrapped up (haha get it?) in convenient images:!#@p!#@And I didn’t forget our two token non-Spotify bloggers:!#@p!#@Unfortunately, Spotify did not report our top genres of the year (apparently because they fired the one guy who knew how that system worked and then it broke). Instead, we got some cursed “2024 Music Evolution”. Interpret at your own risk:!#@p!#@(Wtf indeed, Kai. Nothing in this section aligns with what we’ve seen above. What even is “Mcbling Strut Pop”?)!#@p!#@(I originally planned to use the Spotify API to create my own version of the genre list they used to have, but then I decided to study for my statistics final instead. Maybe I will replace this paragraph with that image after my finals are over…)!#@p!#@Finally, here’s the playlist with everyone’s top five songs. Enjoy!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-800x624.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-3-800x585.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Artboard-1-5-800x572.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blogger-wrapped-2024/
a blog from the universe by Veronica P. '27,aka me + my tarot cards + finals season procrastination,by Veronica P. '27,"December 14, 2024","Finals season is well and officially upon us, but I couldn’t help but feel the itch to blog. So, I turned to the world’s best enabler- a coin flip- because who can argue against the will of the universe?!#@p!#@heads– write this blog!#@p!#@tails- continue locking into 2.003!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5779-1-400x297.jpeg]!#@Recently, I had a person ask me: “you know it’s bad luck to be superstitious, right?” Which is really funny only because it accomplished his intention of making me, the superstitious person, look ridiculous when I replied- “really?!”!#@p!#@Gullibility aside, however, I think things like magic 8 ball outcomes and tarot card readings can be really helpful to encourage reflection. All the material is there- how you feel about your life, what decision your gut really wants to make- but practices like these help draw them out to the surface; the whimsy of it all only adds to the appeal.!#@p!#@So— in keeping with the theme while also in the interest of not entirely derailing my finals schedule— I’m going to pull one tarot card to prompt my blog writing today:!#@p!#@Before we start interpreting, here’s my general understanding of how to approach tarot. I’m going to model this with my own interpretation, but I encourage you to try it out yourself as well:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/download.jpg]!#@Something I love about my tarot deck is how the artwork really tells the story, which I’ll try to paraphrase now:!#@p!#@To me, this card pinpoints that familiar rut many of us tend to fall into- that moment where life doesn’t seem quite as exciting or fulfilling as it once was. The key to escaping this, the card ventures, is to reflect on what exactly it is that you desire- those wants in the back of your mind that always seem to elude you. After this round of soul searching, it’s time to change course, to take the necessary steps to get you there. It may not be the easy choice, but it’s a lot better than wondering ‘what if?’!#@p!#@Immediately, the notion of a ‘lukewarm life’ jumped out at me. As a freshman, I found that my life often felt filled to the brim with novelty and uncertainty. Everything was a learning experience; the world had just opened up for me in a big way, a treasure trove of shiny new things to explore. As a sophomore, I can’t help feeling like my world is smaller again; I’ve already strolled down that path, and I’ve realized what lies there wasn’t for me- often, coming to that realization was painful. What once was viable, uncharted territory is now lost. Sure, I know my way around better, but I feel more jaded. It doesn’t make much sense to go exploring even further when I’ve found plenty of perfectly nice places to settle.!#@p!#@Talking with other college sophomores, I’ve found that a lot of them share this sentiment. Talking with juniors and seniors, it’s as if I’ve finally learned the language they’ve all been speaking, stripped of my ‘freshman-ness’ and now able to join the club.!#@p!#@It’s not that the novelty is completely gone- it’s just that it now takes a lot more effort to access; it seems less worth it to try and tap into. We have roots in places that need tending. Often, it’s more rewarding to nurture and appreciate what we know. Sure, the loss feels fresh now- but with time, surely I’ll be assured that settling was the right choice, won’t I?!#@p!#@Perhaps I’ve overly abstracted this with the metaphor- but it feels like it applies to so many aspects of my life: the major I’m pursuing, the extracurriculars I’m involved in, the communities I spend my time in, the people I interact with. On paper, I’m at a place in my life that should feel fulfilling and right, finally with enough footing to start building towards something. But every weekday comes with a giant to-do list, in my face and obscuring my vision from anything beyond the immediate demands- turning in my problem sets, meeting my research deliverables, organizing my floor’s next event, completing the next application. By the time that weekend rolls around, I’m so exhausted by my week that I frantically indulge in whatever provides the most immediate relief- whether it’s going out with friends or binging a show or spending too much money on Newbury Street. At MIT, ‘work hard play hard’ is the norm, oscillating between extremes. Ultimately, it’s as if my net displacement is zero- I’m not really going anywhere, but I’m still constantly moving.!#@p!#@So, when I got this card, I immediately resonated with the sentiment of stagnancy and dissatisfaction. But then, it was almost as if my tarot book was mocking me. “You know what you need to do,” it asserted, when I most definitely do not. When you perpetually feel at risk of falling behind, it’s hard to convince yourself that it’s worth it to stop and gather your bearings.!#@p!#@But I suppose I can buy into the notion that somewhere, in some crevice of my brain, lies that intuition. So, post finals hectic-ness, I’m going to try and set an appointment or three with my journal and see if I can find it out.!#@p!#@Honestly, after pulling this card I hesitated on whether I would post this blog at all. My interpretation feels incomplete, lacking a concrete resolution. At the very least, however, it’s motivating to consider the idea that you’re the one in control of your life. If you feel unsatisfied, you have the instinct within you to pinpoint exactly why— and the ability to follow up that discovery with action.!#@p!#@Besides, the universe told me to write this blog, so I suppose I have to listen.!#@p!#@p.s. to any prospective applicants: i swear i didn’t rig this tarot reading to encourage you to apply to MIT, but if that’s what your gut really wants- be brave <3!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5779-1-400x297.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/download.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/tarot-cards-5/
A Fireside Chat with President Sally Kornbluth by Emiko P. '25,get to know our president!,by Emiko P. '25,"December 13, 2024","Did you know that President Sally Kornbluth, MIT’s 18th president, has sung onstage with one of MIT’s student acapella groups called the Chorallaries? Did you know that she is a foodie and loves to try new restaurants in Cambridge and Boston? Did you know that she does needlepoint portraits of dogs? Did you know that she loves folk music, her family and friends, and political drama TV shows?!#@p!#@I didn’t know any of this.!#@p!#@In fact, I knew next to nothing about our newly inducted president until I sat with her face-to-face in her office to get to know her better. Her office was everything you’d expect the President of MIT’s office to be – dark wood panels lined the walls, a grand desk stood proudly in front of a wall of books, a sweeping view of MIT’s main courtyard could be seen from the windows, and the President herself smiled warmly at me behind a pair of teal glasses.!#@p!#@Almost two years ago, President Sally Kornbluth succeeded former President Rafael Reif as the 18th MIT President. We may recognize her face and her title, but what is the President of MIT like on a personal level? Well, let’s find out.!#@p!#@“Every day you hear something unbelievable,” President Kornbluth says about her daily life at MIT. She loves that you can get a daily fix of science because you are surrounded by such amazing people and endeavors. She is proud of MIT and how it can provide real solutions to society’s problems.!#@p!#@She loves the entrepreneurial spirit, too. “How many friends of yours have started companies?” she asks me. Immediately, half a dozen people spring to mind, and I laugh and tell her, “A lot.” We share a smile because we both know that this drive to learn and create is something uniquely special about MIT.!#@p!#@It seems that this may be the easiest question of all for President Kornbluth to answer. She loves her friends and family, exploring area restaurants, hiking on trails like the Minuteman Trail, and exploring new countries (like when she went to Iceland last summer!). She loves the rejuvenating feeling of nature, and she loves traveling in order to immerse herself in completely new cultures and environments. It seems to me that she is kind of like an anthropologist of new people and experiences, carefully collecting them and expanding her knowledge of the world. I tell her this, and she says, “You have to be curious. If not, things would be a lot more dull.”!#@p!#@MIT is known for its nerdy interests – and our president is no different. “I’m definitely nerdy. I like to read books on anything. Also over the pandemic, I got super into needlepoint, which I know sounds super funny,” President Kornbluth tells me. I have to agree, that does sound pretty funny. She then explains how, as a dog lover at heart, she has gotten into the hobby of doing needlepoint portraits of people’s dogs!!#@p!#@She then goes on to say, “But I’m not really mechanically adept. I’m really wanting to learn those skills!”!#@p!#@And then something occurred to me: “Wait, are you allowed to take classes?”!#@p!#@“Well, I could if I had the time!” she says with a laugh. And with that, we commence a brainstorming session on what classes President Kornbluth should take next semester.!#@p!#@President Kornbluth trained as a cancer biologist, which has led her to be passionate about the life sciences. She tells me about the new MIT Health and Life Sciences Collaborative, which is seeding high-impact collaborations and interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences at MIT. She noted a launch event was in the works that would include faculty talks from MIT’s cast of luminaries… which actually took place last week (you can watch it here!)!#@p!#@Another passion of hers is climate. Although she has no trained expertise in the subject, her passion for climate and her belief that climate change is one of the greatest issues of our day has led her to pioneer the Climate Project at MIT. The goal of this project is to figure out how to get people at MIT – all working on their own brilliant projects separately – to row in the same direction. People and projects can be grouped into missions, such as “Building and Adapting Healthy, Resilient Cities” or “Restoring the Atmosphere, Protecting the Land and Oceans.” This subject captured her imagination as a pressing problem that MIT can actually approach, especially because she was looking for ways that MIT’s deep knowledge could underpin actual policy recommendations.!#@p!#@Another project is called MITHIC⁠01 , which is a platform for collaboration between the SHASS and departments in MIT’s other schools and the college. MITHIC will include seed money for projects, educational initiatives, undergraduate research opportunities, and postdoc fellowships. Examples of funds include the SHASS+ Connectivity Fund and the Humanities Cultivation Fund.!#@p!#@The spirit of MIT has always been mens et manus: mind and hand. It is a message stating that we don’t only solve problems on paper – we turn them into reality. This philosophy really shines in all of these new projects spearheaded by President Kornbluth, and it makes me excited to see our president taking the initiative to create programs that will use the minds of MIT to better our world.!#@p!#@“It’s cool to be curious here! It’s cool to start companies and to take hard classes,” she says. “Also, it’s not what we know – it’s how we know it. The elegance of science is something to be admired. If you’re curious to know something, MIT will give you the tools to figure it out.” President Kornbluth’s personal curiosity aligns well with MIT’s own intrinsic curiosity. That’s why she created her own podcast called Curiosity Unbounded, where she and special guests discuss everything from evolution to literature to 4D printing.!#@p!#@She also emphasizes how amazingly collaborative MIT is. President Kornbluth tells me about how she recently visited and had dinner at Phi Beta Epsilon, one of MIT’s fraternities on campus, and was struck by the camaraderie and cooperativeness of the students in the fraternity. She tells me that it gives her hope that we have a whole generation of students moving society forward with a can-do attitude. She says, “It’s a hopeful act to be taking action.”!#@p!#@President Sally Kornbluth made quite the impression on me. Her joy for learning, for the surprise and delight that the discovery of new knowledge provides, reminds me a lot of the students here at MIT. She always seeks to grow – even in areas she is not an expert in. She is an example of a life-long learner, of being adaptable and excited when confronted with unfamiliar situations, of finding joy and purpose in the pursuit of the betterment of society.!#@p!#@She also wants to be involved in students’ lives. I don’t think it’s very common for a student like me to be able to email their university President, casually request an interview, and then get a response the very next day with an enthusiastic of course! That’s pretty cool, if you ask me.!#@p!#@I hope reading this has helped our president become a more familiar face. Next time you see President Kornbluth walking through the halls, maybe you will wave hello, or ask for a restaurant recommendation, or commission a needlepoint portrait of your dog.⁠02 Or maybe you will make sure to catch her next acapella performance.!#@p!#@Thanks for chatting, President Kornbluth! See you around campus :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/iceland-3.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/dog-needlepoint-1.jpeg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/iceland-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/dog-needlepoint-1.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-fireside-chat-with-president-sally-kornbluth/
DO YOU WANNA BUILD A SNOWMAN?? by Allison E. '27,I KNOW YOU DO,by Allison E. '27,"December 13, 2024","RAHHHH IT SNOWED AGAIN!!!!#@p!#@As the blogs’ resident snow enthusiast, I consider it my sacred duty to announce the FIRST(ish)⁠01 SNOW OF THE YEAR!! (several days late)!#@p!#@We’ve been getting occasional “it MiGhT snow… mAyBe” messages from the cryptic weather machine, and even got a very melty dusting a couple days ago. Fortunately, however, snow with staying power chose a weekend to finally arrive :D!#@p!#@Even more ironically, the snow chose to arrive during the middle of B2⁠02 ’s notably tropical-themed floormal party. With a giant beach poster covering one wall, tropical imagery displayed on the TV, a large quantity of fake lei, and half the attendees dressed in shorts and aloha shirts, we were… rather ill-prepared for the snowfall.!#@p!#@Nevertheless, we persevered!! In whatever combination of short sleeves, short shorts, and open-toed shoes, we streamed outside, caught snowflakes in our mouths, threw some snowballs at each other, and quickly scurried back into the warmth of the dorm.!#@p!#@But of course, the story doesn’t end here. As snow began to actually build up on the sidewalk, I went to find some of my friends upstairs, changed into more cold-appropriate clothes, and we went outside!!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013114-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013112-800x600.jpg]!#@Of course, I had to make an obligatory snow angel:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013230-scaled-e1733803374226-1000x793.jpg]!#@By this time, it was 1:30 am, and we had work to do. But sometimes, side quests must be sidequested: it was time to build a snowman.!#@p!#@Now, as you probably noticed, there really wasn’t that much snow on the ground. Luckily, the snow was sticky⁠03 , and Ojas G. ’27 and I were persistent. Starting from small seeds, we systematically cleared several sidewalk sections to create our snowballs. We stacked the balls, reinforced the connection points, collected two arm sticks, retrieved one of the B2 fake lei, poked holes in the head for sunglasses, and used two Hershey’s kisses donated by passerbys as buttons. We added a sign for the final touch, and…!#@p!#@BEHOLD! THE SNOWMAN!!!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_030058-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_031944-800x600.jpg]!#@Anyways, that took an hour and a half, and we had to get back to work, so we went back inside and psetted until various times (between 5:00 am and 10:00 am). The final stretch before the semester ends can do… things… to your sleep schedule. Also it was the weekend, and as Ojas noted, “the time spent building the snowman has come directly out of my sleep and potentially my grades but it was 100% worth it.”!#@p!#@The next day was, unfortunately, quite warm (high of 48F), and when I left our dorm that morning, our poor snowman had not fared well… His death will be avenged, the next time it snows >:(!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_114402-3-1000x750.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013114-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013112-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_013230-scaled-e1733803374226-1000x793.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_030058-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_031944-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241208_114402-3-1000x750.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/do-you-wanna-build-a-snowman/

That’s the same place that you’ve been tracking your application checklist, which will now be turned off. Your decision will be awaiting you there, behind a button that says “View Update.” Make sure that you are ready to receive your decision, whatever it may be, before you press that button.⁠03!#@p!#@In order to help logistically prepare yourself, I recommend you practice logging in now so you don’t run into any issues next Tuesday.

If you still need help after that, feel free to email admissions@mit.edu and someone from our team will get back to you!!#@p!#@Admissions decisions will be available exclusively online. Decisions will not be released via email, skywriting, snail telegraph, carrier pigeon, balloon mail, or intergalactic radio broadcast. However, we will be sending admitted students additional, cylindrical information in the near future.!#@p!#@Until then, remember to do things that remind you that you are, in fact, human. Take a couple deep breaths—of outside air if you can, whether it’s crisp or muggy or in between. Create something silly with or for your friends. Watch something that makes you stop and think “wow, the world we live in is freakin’ wild and I am so lucky to be here.”!#@p!#@And when it comes time for Early Action decisions, we’ll be here on these blogs with some open threads for you to chat with people who are going through very similar emotional rollercoasters, or admissions officers and bloggers who have had their own ups and downs.

Aiden Wrapped by Aiden H. '28,a year in review,by Aiden H. '28,"December 3, 2024","It’s December, which means it is time to (drumroll please)…!#@p!#@🎉🎉HAVE AN MINOR EXISTENTIAL CRISIS BECAUSE SOMEHOW 11 MONTHS HAVE PASSED (cue airhorn noise)🎉🎉!#@p!#@As someone who loves to obsess over random, useless statistics,⁠01 I am naturally the friend that will always send you my top-ten everything of the year completely unsolicited. TierMaker is my best friend, I use a Tumblr Song Sorter after every major album release, and everything in my mind exists in a battle-to-the-death style list of what’s better (kind of like the Challenge Towers from Mortal Kombat). Now that I have a minor platform, I finally have a place to share my awful opinions and create my own war in the comments.!#@p!#@My biggest issue with “end-of-year” rankings, though, is that every major magazine/newspaper always releases them at the beginning of December, so we always forget about everything important that happens in December. But, I refuse to break a trend and naturally will enforce this delusion that December has no important pop culture.!#@p!#@So without further ado,⁠02 here are my most important rankings of 2024-things.!#@p!#@Movies!#@p!#@I simultaneously love going to the movies and also rarely go. Part of that is the curse of streaming has become as destructive as ever, turning every movie that could be good in the theater into a god-forsaken “Netflix Original”. I just hate streaming movies if it’s my first time watching it, since streaming gives more of a mindless, I’m-just-gonna-put-this-one-while-I-pset kind of vibe, which inevitably leads to me watching the same things over and over and only being exposed to new movies when one reasonably good one comes out every 6 months. This sadly means that of the movies I did go see, I only really liked 4. Nonetheless, here are the best movies I saw in the theater that came out this year.!#@p!#@Movies that were bad: Despicable Me 4, Inside Out 2, Mean Girls, A Family Affair!#@p!#@Movies I still need to watch: My Old Ass, Saturday Night, We Live In Time, Blink Twice, Anora!#@p!#@Movies I (probably) won’t watch: Moana 2, Gladiator II, It Ends With Us, Twisters!#@p!#@The hard part with music rankings is always that the length of projects and when they were released in the year affects everything so drastically. Sure, I might have listened to the Taylor Swift album “more”, but that’s because Taylor’s album is 30 songs while Billie’s only has 10. Also, Taylor, Beyonce, Billie, and Charli all came out in the spring, while Chromakopia (or even GNX by Kendrick) came out so recently that I feel like I can’t rank it higher than these other albums I obsessed over, even though I might actually like them more. Finally, the amount of music I listen to that came out before this year would throw off this chart entirely.!#@p!#@Nonetheless, consider these 10 the majority of the music I was listening to.⁠05!#@p!#@Concerts I went to: Bad Bunny (Denver/Ball Arena), The Head and the Heart (Morrison/Red Rocks), Clairo (Boston/Roadrunner)!#@p!#@Books!#@p!#@I’ve said this for a couple of years now, but I will be reading more in 2025.

Hopefully leisurely travel is in my future.!#@p!#@2024 – Final Thoughts!#@p!#@This is the shortest year I feel like we’ve had in a while, probably because it feels like the first real year since COVID. I have felt pretty stuck since the pandemic, which is a common thing for a lot of people but I think especially Gen-Z.

Part of that is almost definitely moving to college, but also the vibes were just a lot more regular? 2024 definitely gives 2019 in the strongest way. Fortunately, I had no tragic life events or major upsets in my year, and a lot of it was smooth sailing, which allowed for it to feel very fast.!#@p!#@2025 doesn’t even sound like a year, so I have quite literally no idea what it holds (except for probably organic chemistry).

what’s in the box? by Janet G. '27,why is spring cleaning a common phrase but not fall cleaning hmm,by Janet G. '27,"December 1, 2024","today yesterday thanksgiving was a few days ago, and in the world of this post it is still thanksgiving day,⁠01 which means that it’s a particularly boring day for me. i woke up to grey skies and decided to go back to bed for another two hours. once i finally mustered up the willpower to get up, i found myself facing the once-in-a-blue-moon challenge: finding something to occupy myself with.!#@p!#@my friend Espen S. ‘27 invents a lot of games. one of these we sometimes call the phrasing game: where you choose a Thing, and phrase it in the best and worst possible ways. an example could be my 6.1210⁠02 problem set that was due last week: you could call it “an fun intellectual exercise which challenges your understanding of dynamic programming and pushes you to confidently write your own algorithms”, or you could call it “the fucker that kept me up until 4am and made me question all my life decisions that lead to me trying to debug the worst code i’ve written in my life.” hopefully you get the gist.!#@p!#@this game popped up in my head today as i was digging through the boxes under my bed. when you apply this game to “the way janet structures her room”, you could say that i’m a very sentimental person who treasures even the littlest things in life. you could also call me a messy hoarder.!#@p!#@anyway— the point is mostly that i have a lot of random shit that i haven’t had the heart to throw out, and since today i really needed something to do, i decided to clean out some part of my room.!#@p!#@there’s this one box in my room which you could call a fire hazard. it’s stuffed to the brim with papers: past exams, letter collections, posters and programs from events i’ve gone to in the past year or so. the exams were an easy go; the letters from my friends were an easy keep. the posters are awkward. they’re some schrodinger’s-marie-kondo-esque dilemma — i do not think about them very often, but every time i do, there’s some warmth of recalling the memories that come with them which makes me hesitant to throw them away. last year we put them on the wall, but this year our suite is shaped too awkwardly for me to plaster posters all over them again.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image14-3-400x536.png]!#@today i’ve finally found a solution to this problem! i am going to inventory all of the posters and programs in this blog, and get paid to store my memories here instead of keeping the wad of awkward papers in my room.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image12-2.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image44.png]!#@the boston ballet’s nutcracker was the first ever ballet i went to! Sophie L. ‘27 got her and me $15 tickets to the boston ballet (i think they have a student discount), and a whole bunch of us met up to go watch. it was really beautiful and i definitely felt very fancy, but i have to admit that i fell asleep halfway through the second act… it was still all very impressive though, would go again if i had time (unfortunately this year i probably don’t). pnr behaviour, etc.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image8-2.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image37-1.png]!#@one of the first actual events in the year that i went to, back when i was a wide-eyed frosh who wanted to be everything everywhere all at once.⁠03 the EC community is one of those communities who i respect immensely, but unfortunately didn’t initially click and now i feel a little far from. hall rush was cool though, i really liked all of their rooms and talking to all the halls about their cultures. i learned dj-ing from putz briefly too which was cool :P i’ve forgotten all of it though!#@p!#@MITSO⁠04 always has pretty good pieces. i honestly don’t remember much from this aside from the fact that i liked dvorak and may have fallen asleep during some of the variations…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image29-1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-29-at-11.29.28 PM-800x857.png]!#@i think this was the first acapella concert that i went to at mit? it was very sweet. the mit centrifugues also have a special place in my heart because i was briefly in it for two weeks at the start of freshman fall, and then dropped because i had too many commitments :’) i adore the mashups and the spinning arts guest feature was also really cute!!#@p!#@so i have to confess that i only watched this over the livestream… i think someone else actually went and i was on my program collecting mode which is why i have this LOL. VGO has a really good set and there’s this one bit where the cellists spin their cellos for Rainbow Road, which i thought was very funny. wish i could’ve gone in person but we had VGO perform live for Blueprint ‘24⁠05 so that was also pretty good :P!#@p!#@ADT might have been the first dance show i went to!

went during spring ‘24, it was so fun. i have a lot of friends in both MissBehaviour and MIT MoveMENTality, and they really ate. the energy of the crowd was impeccable, the guest performers were incredible, and even the breaks between songs had some of the most fun bits that i’ve seen. they worked very hard for it and it was a really good time :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image3.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image6-4.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image16-2-800x898.png]!#@Footwork XVII (MIT Ridonkulous’ annual dance showcase) was very fun. i really hadn’t seen so many dance groups in one sitting before this so it was very awe-inspiring LOL. there were quite a few technical difficulties on the day but in a way it really helped show how well the groups train — for one song the sound died out in the last minute and the group literally just continued by coordinated muscle memory, which both the crowd and i were very very impressed by. the wifi also died in kresge and they couldn’t get the soundtrack working for ages for another group ☠️but the group just went with it (shoutout MIT Bhangra for pushing through) and we had some fun improv instead!#@p!#@bonus because technically not during the school year: the boston festival orchestra runs free events every summer, so a few friends and i popped down to one of the halls at the new england conservatory to the see them! thankful to Audrey and Phoenix for telling me about it – i really enjoyed their playing of scheherazarde, although have to admit that i dozed off again at some point… there’s really a theme with this.!#@p!#@i also went to a storytelling circle with Nicole H. ‘27 when i visited her in pittsburgh over the summer. i really loved the cosiness of the space, and this was one of their little programs that they were running for the summer :) unfortunately i only stayed for 3 days so couldn’t actually experience the program for myself!#@p!#@mit concert choir’s Fall ’24 performance! a few of my friends were performing here (this was also the day we did blogston commons, and i mentioned it briefly). as per usual, i again crashed out for a little bit, ⁠09 but i did enjoy the soloists. opera singers have a very clear voice which is impressive and enjoyable in a way distinct from pop music, and i was in a anti-pop-music mood at the time so this was extra refreshing!#@p!#@mocha moves’⁠10 annual dance competition! i loved the spooky theme this year and thought their pubbing posters were done very well. i unfortunately only pulled up for the half the time because i had to run to a friend’s halloween was yesterday party and i also had to review for exams the monday after. it was still very good though, and a particular shoutout to MMT’s mickey mouse set because it was the funniest set i’ve seen in a while.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image21-2.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image34-1-800x856.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image13-2-800x1092.png]!#@the pillowman!! very cool. another LOST ⁠11 production. my friend Tristan C. ‘27 was one of the leads so he told me about it a lot, and quite a few of my other friends were playing in it too so i kinda had to go. the play also made me cry a lot — martin mcdonough wrote an excellent play, which i thought the LOST group did justice to. i also completely did not expect the direction in which the play went, which was a welcome surprise, because i was really forced to engage with the play as as result. sometimes when i watch media i will have read the synopsis already (oops admitting to a cardinal sin right here), which helps me stand away from the play and examine the meta of it more rather than just feel the emotions in the story. maybe this is an admittance of being afraid to trust the author… anyway watching this play live made me appreciate the value of trusting the author LOL. i also really loved the little string detailing that tied together the book, and i thought the design choices of this program were incredibly clean.!#@p!#@i also went to catsymptones (mit asymptones’ spring 24 concert), MIT Live’s spring ’24 showcase, mulog (mit logarhythm’s fall 24 concert), and another two MIT symphony orchestra concerts but i can’t find the program for any of them :( they were all very cute though and all of them made me think a lot about performance and joy, which maybe i will write about another day!#@p!#@i went to the simmons pre-christmas study break with Maggie L. ‘27 in fall ’23 which was very cute. personal favourite might have been the homemade waffles, but i also really liked the wild babies study break where i met one of the GRA’s pet snake who was very cute!! we don’t have wild snakes in new zealand so this was pretty new to me!#@p!#@i remember going to this event in Spring ’24 and browsing a lot but not really buying anything; a win for my wallet, but not a permanent fix considering how much i was using retail therapy at the end of the semester as a coping mechanism!#@p!#@udo is the burton-conner area director,⁠12 margaret’s dog. he is very cute. this was a very cute event. udo was wearing a cute hat and i ate popcorn and patted the dog. good event with good bois!#@p!#@the classic ABC, one of two campus-wide parties hosted by B3rd. i actually don’t think i went because i was away on a retreat, but their postering is iconic (the orange paper, the variants of the acronym ABC) and we found it really funny that this was the acronym in our suite.!#@p!#@me1tdown, another campus-wide party hosted by the b1ners. again very clean design decisions, i believe i pulled up for a while and jammed for a bit. very fun, i really liked their deco but don’t think i have a photo of it :(!#@p!#@of course, i can’t miss our own campus-wide party. we held our inaugural one last year in celebration (protest?) of the 250th anniversary of the boston tea party, and held another one this year. our floor chairs carried it by doing the brunt of the planning and work, but overall it was very fun to help out with! last year i even invited my Real British Friend Ojas G. ‘27 who pulled up in his very british trenchcoat and all. two of my friends who shall remain anonymous also accidentally broke through the roof tile while starships was playing last year. this year we had a lot less chaos i think but also homemade boba that Alex Z. ‘28 spent 4 hours making, and it was DELICIOUS so i think if you’re on campus come fall ‘25 this will not be one to miss.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5967.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5968-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image36-1-800x1271.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5966-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image24-1-800x431.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image42-1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image40.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image43.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image33-1.png]!#@these are technically not posters but it also turns out that i hoarded a number of lanyards too!#@p!#@ANYWAY thanks for coming along to my haul!

How to Build an LED Acrylic Sign by Richard O. '28,Your Complete Beginners Guide,by Richard O. '28,"November 30, 2024","I absolutely love the design process. Everything from coming up with an idea to bringing it to life are things I don’t think I can ever get sick of. So when a discussion came up during a house meeting about things we could do to change up the Chocolate City lounge space, I absolutely jumped at the idea of creating a new sign for our wall.!#@p!#@For reference, the previous sign was a printed banner which to me felt pretty old-school and was asking to be improved.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4758-scaled.jpg]!#@So with that, the following instructions will teach you how to make your very own acrylic signage from scratch!!#@p!#@Step 1: Visualize the sign in your designated space!#@p!#@Alright so I’m not like a super cracked Autodesk user or anything but I do love using Blender ⁠01 for visualizing my ideas. So before even discussing it with the rest of our house, I ended up drafting what the sign would look like using some pictures of the wall and created different 3D versions of the sign on top of the pictures to see what people thought.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5681-800x581.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5682-800x607.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-214043-800x573.png]!#@Now at first, I had drafted these concepts using inspo from this one YouTube video and thought that maybe a modern font would look a lot more sleek on our wall. But of course, sometimes the cooler designs aren’t the most feasible since some of the brothers pointed out that the wiring for LEDs between each letter for the modern fonts would end up being exposed since we, unfortunately, can’t drill holes for wires into our wall. So thus the original cursive script font that I found by using whatthefont on our banner became the set style for the project.!#@p!#@Step 2: Discuss, Collect Measurements, and Create Files!#@p!#@With the idea approved, it was now time to actually brainstorm all the logistics behind getting the sign up. So to do this we created a group chat and began talking about things ranging from materials, to hanging the signs to LED options, to maker spaces to work on it, etc.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-184448.png]!#@Next step was to see all the different arrangements of the wording we could make on different-sized acrylic sheets that would allow us to save money while maintaining the original size of the font from the banner. We then also realized that some laser cutters would have sizing restrictions so we ended up just getting four 12×24 sheets to be on the safe side with the word “Chocolate” being split between two sheets.!#@p!#@Afterwards, it was time to turn the letters into a format that could actually be read by the laser cutters. So to do this, I went back to Figma ⁠02 to flatten the font so that instead of the words being treated like text, they would be treated like vector shapes. After flattening them, each of the letters became composed of line segments connected by individual points which you can see in the second picture and once I addressed some overlap issues, I then exported the words as SVG vector files and passed them along to my friend Ty who is a senior in the house that was more experienced in maker spaces than I was and helped convert those SVG files to DXF files more suitable for the cutter.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-190736-800x470.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-184802-800x560.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-191740-800x483.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-192917-800x482.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-192222-800x440.png]!#@Step 3: Gather Your Ingredients!#@p!#@The following ingredients are specific to this recipe but can be adjusted accordingly for your own needs:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-200433-800x498.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-195814-800x493.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-195938-800x547.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-195843-800x565.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5678-800x1422.jpg]!#@Step 4: Bake Your Acrylic in a 60 Watt Universal Systems Free Standing CO2 Laser Cutter!#@p!#@Laser cutters have to be the top 10 coolest things humans have ever built (the Colosseum would probably come in 11th place or something). Prior to this project I had never actually used one on my own but having both staff at the EDS ⁠03 maker space and a senior there that were willing to show me how to actually work one made the learning experience so much more fun. But like…you’re telling me a skinny automated lightsaber pretty much cut out these detailed shapes in like 2 minutes?!#@p!#@Anyways we started by lasering the “Choco” part and noticed that the cutter had offset the top of the letters from the bottom and started doing some weird stuff and not cutting right which led to us losing a sheet. But weirdly enough, one of the EDS staff who was helping us went into this back room of materials and walked out with the exact same sheet of glossy black acrylic we had been using in the exact same dimensions we had purchased and let us use it for free (absolute miracle). So before we tried again, we realized the alignment of the file on the bed was a little off and tested an adjustment to the cut with a piece of cardboard before using acrylic, and after some time we finally had the whole set cut out perfectly.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5282-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5271-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5270-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5294-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5298-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5288-scaled.jpg]!#@Step 5: Mix in the blocks for attaching to the wall and decorate with LEDS!#@p!#@With the acrylic cut, all that was left was to sand the back side, add some epoxy to hold wooden blocks that offset the sign from the wall, and attach the command strips that would keep the whole thing up to those blocks. Our initial plan was to cut a thinner version of the letters from a sheet of wood that we could glue to the back to have the acrylic protrude from for the LEDs but we learned that the laser cutters couldn’t cut 1/2-inch wood sheets which was the thickness we needed to have the LEDs face out so we ended up just cutting square blocks and gluing them to the back along the letters. After attaching those blocks we then wrapped the strips along the edge so they would make the wall glow without actually being seen.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5303-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5685-800x414.jpg]!#@Now after we had the sign up…it was a nice moment you know…the idea had finally come alive on our wall. But me being the person I am, I knew the sign had so much more potential. My first issue came with the LEDs themselves…something about them being spotty just felt too tacky to me and didn’t match the vision of the sign I had in my mind. To add to that, because we started wrapping the LEDs from the “C” in chocolate, the wire to power them had to come out the side and just looked too obvious and less integrated. And when showing the sign to the rest of the house I accidentally dropped the “est.” which foreshadowed worse to come.!#@p!#@So after it hung up for like a day I was able to convince people that the overly price diffused LED strips would just make the whole thing so much better…and we bought them.!#@p!#@Once they arrived, all that was left was to remove the sign from the wall, replace the LEDs, measure out the cable covers, and put it right back up…right…!#@p!#@Step 6: COMPLETELY OPTIONAL – Accidentally drop the sign so part of it shatters forcing you to restart…!#@p!#@Wrong.!#@p!#@So basically once I got help taking the sign off, I started thinking about the best way to hide the wires and found that there was a pipe along the ceiling that I could hide the cables with if we wrapped the LED strip starting from the letter “i” in “City” (this will make more sense in a picture below). So with that, I wanted to measure how long we would need to cut the cable cover to hide the wire from the letter “i” up to the pipe at the ceiling. And of course, the best way to do that would be to put the word “City” back up and measure the distance from the top of the i to the ceiling…!#@p!#@But you see…sometimes I don’t really think things through because when I put the “City” up, I only pressed down on two of the top-most command strips to hold it up because in my head I thought: “Oh I don’t need to press it into all the command strips, this will only take three seconds and I’ll just take it right down”. And of course, gravity wasn’t on my side that day…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5674-scaled.jpg]!#@So the City came crumbling down and had to be rebuilt.!#@p!#@So back to EDS I went carrying acrylic sheets to re-laser the City and made another cardboard cutout to test the laser before putting the acrylic in but also realized after making it that I could use that same cardboard to measure the cable cover length the second time without breaking any actual acrylic.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5610-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5613-1-800x1161.jpg]!#@Step 7: Add your newly purchased diffused lights, adjust the wiring, and trust the process!#@p!#@Now was the time. The diffused lights were so much brighter, colorful, and…actually diffused and I couldn’t contain my excitement as I wrapped them for this newer version. The strip was also a lot thicker this time though, so I had to do some weird stuff with pipe cleaners and electrical tape to keep it in place…but you just have to trust the process…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5625-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5626-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5624-scaled-e1733021988390-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5620-800x600.jpg]!#@Step 8: Put it up again and enjoy!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5629-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5631-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5677-800x1384.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5686-800x1201.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5687-800x1221.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5671-scaled.jpg]!#@And there you have it, your very own acrylic sign!

I love musicals! by Kanokwan T. '25,Wicked just dropped and I am LOSING MY MIND,by Kanokwan T. '25,"November 29, 2024","worry not: there are no Wicked spoilers in this blog!#@p!#@Last Friday, I saw Wicked on opening night with two friends (Caitlin O. ‘25 and Oris S. N. ‘23), and I went absolutely FERAL. I have been waiting for this film for LITERALLY 10 YEARS.⁠01!#@p!#@I HAVE BEEN SIMMERING. BUZZING. WAITING ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. HEARING GLIMMERS OF NEWS EVERY NOW AND THEN OVER THE YEARS, BUT NOT LETTING MYSELF GET TOO EXCITED UNTIL THE OFFICIAL OFFICIAL THING WAS OFFICIALIZED. AND THE THING HAS FIIIIIINNNNNNALLLLY COME OUT!!!⁠02!#@p!#@Here’s some fun Kano-lore: Wicked was my gateway musical. A decade ago, my friend Adrien V. V. ‘24 told me I should go, and I did—completely cold. I went in only knowing that the name of the musical was Wicked. My god. I remember feeling so entranced and transported. The opening monkey scene lives in my brain rent free. I became so horribly obsessed.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-3-1000x750.png]!#@Anyways. Having seen Wicked, I’ve been inspired to finally get to a blog that I’ve been meaning to write for a long time…!#@p!#@AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!#@p!#@okay let’s calm down a little bit⁠03!#@p!#@and establish clear definitions!#@p!#@THE UNVEILED HUMAN EXPERIENCE!#@p!#@There’s something extraordinary about show tunes: they take the innermost thoughts you never dared to share and suddenly bring them to life on stage. It’s as if someone pressed pause on the world to let the emotions and struggles of a character explode into song and dance. Show tunes bring the most internal (feelings and thoughts) to the most external (the stage).!#@p!#@More broadly, experiences that immerse people in shared storytelling—like live music, watching a movie, seeing a musical theater production, or other forms of collective art—are some of the moments in which I’ve felt most connected to others. Where else do waves of sound and light ripple through a space, enveloping a crowd of people, all experiencing the same performance yet each holding their own unique connection to the art? The fourth wall feels…holy? And ephemeral. It’s there, then it’s gone. Have you ever been in an empty theater? The magic lingers, but only briefly. The electricity that once pulsed through the space dissipates, leaving only echoes.!#@p!#@And yet, in those transient moments, something profound happens. Show tunes give voice to the unsaid. “Tomorrow” from Annie embodies the steadfast hope of new beginnings, no matter how heavy the present feels. “Losing My Mind” from Follies captures the ache of someone occupying your mind from the moment you wake. The weary cynicism of “Money, Money, Money” from Mamma Mia reveals the frustration of a world overrun by privilege and power. And “Cell Block Tango” from Chicago conveys the raw frustration of feeling misunderstood, the desire for others to see and validate your truth if only they knew the full story.!#@p!#@A PERSONAL NOTE!#@p!#@For me, “Breathe” from In the Heights resonates particularly deeply. At one point, I made the difficult decision to take a leave from MIT for the fall of my sophomore year.⁠04 As part of the MIT FLI (first-generation and/or low-income) community, the weight of that choice felt immense. It wasn’t just stepping back from school, but from a path my family and I had poured years of relentless grit into carving out, a path that carried the hopes of breaking cycles and building a better future. I worried constantly that I was letting them down, that I wasn’t living up to the sacrifices they had made.!#@p!#@“Breathe” captures that exact tension:!#@p!#@Hearing those words—the restlessness, the pressure, the return—felt like seeing my own experience reflected back at me. It was grounding to realize this struggle wasn’t mine alone but one shared so deeply within my community that it even found its way into a show tune.!#@p!#@Live theater creates an unmatched resonance: a shared space where we confront the deeply personal but undeniably universal. The stories feel bigger than ourselves, yet so deeply our own. You’re watching these characters’ truths spill out in front of hundreds of strangers, and suddenly, your own truths feel seen. It’s that rare kind of magic, something profoundly human. In that shared moment, we all show up, gathering in one place to experience something together: art.!#@p!#@THE MAGIC OF MUSICAL THEATRE, EXPLAINED!#@p!#@The best, most-succinct argument I know for show tunes is, fittingly, told in a show tune. Yes, I know it’s a 10-minute video, but it’s so good. If you want to understand why people love Broadway,⁠06 aside from this blog, maybe this video is it.!#@p!#@The MIT Musical Theater Guild stages incredible productions. Over the years, I’ve seen them put on Into the Woods, Pippin, Heathers, Chicago, and most recently, Assassins. Truly impressive work.!#@p!#@Musicals often make their way through Boston, with Broadway in Boston serving as the main hub. There’s almost always a show in town, thanks in part to Boston’s close proximity to New York, where Broadway originated. If you live in Boston and want to catch a musical, you can definitely get your fix.⁠07!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9694-1000x750.jpg]!#@Honestly, seeing actual Broadway in New York is pretty accessible, too. It’s just a four-hour train ride from Boston, and I’ve gone a few times with friends. Here are a few of those experiences:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0625-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0618-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2811_Original-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PXL_20230326_012800500.MP_Original-800x1063.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0125-800x1067.jpg]!#@I would be remiss not to mention Broadway Rave. It’s exactly what it sounds like: a rave blasting Broadway songs. They tour the country, and I usually go whenever they’re in town, which ends up being about 1-3 times a semester. I never get tired of it. I’m not much of a general rave-goer, but Broadway Rave? Absolutely. Dressing up as characters is a big part of the fun: my friends and I join in, and so do many others. The DJ often acts out the songs, mimicking the official stage production, and audience members can even take the stage if they know the choreography, are dressed as a character, or just feel inspired. I’ve been up there once, and it was a blast. The rave is so corny, cheesy, and over-the-top, and I love every second of it. My first Broadway Rave was on February 18th, 2023, thanks to an invitation from my friends Emma S. ‘26 and Charlotte W. ‘23.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1630_Original-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-design-800x600.png]!#@yes, you 🫵🏼!#@p!#@(if you want to dip your toes into musical theatre or simply just dive in deeper)!#@p!#@MUST DO!#@p!#@Watch the 2019 Tony Awards Opening Number⁠09!#@p!#@SHOULD DO⁠10!#@p!#@Go see Wicked!#@p!#@COULD DO!#@p!#@Listen to some show tune classics!#@p!#@WON’T DO!#@p!#@Deny musicals an honest chance!#@p!#@ok that is all!#@p!#@unwickedly,⁠11!#@p!#@Kano!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-3-1000x750.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9694-1000x750.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0625-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0618-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_2811_Original-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PXL_20230326_012800500.MP_Original-800x1063.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0125-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1630_Original-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-design-800x600.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-love-musicals/
"[Guest Post] Next Haunt 2024: The Haunters by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",what it takes to scare MIT students,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","November 27, 2024","Preface from Jebby: In addition to participating in Next Haunt with Andi and Aiden this year, I was also fortunate to have two Next Haunt staff members reply back to my request for a behind-the-scenes guest post. If you haven’t read Part 1, I encourage going back and reading it for context.!#@p!#@Hey guys, its me, the Pigeon Man, but also the producer of this year’s Next Haunt! There is a lot that goes into making this happen every year, from the puzzles to arranging the build and actually running the thing. Because of that, I wanted to talk about some of the processes that went into making sure everything happened. Sophia will discuss this from a puzzle team perspective, so I’ll go in with a general overview of this year’s timeline!!#@p!#@The first major step to start Next Haunt is to recruit exec; most importantly being the producer, a.k.a me. The producers for last year’s Haunt—who became this year’s assistant producers—had interviewed me shortly before spring break about this role, although this was mostly for me to get information on the role rather than anything on their end. As I had been the sound designer the year before, they were already familiar with me. A week or so later, I got the email that I got the role!!#@p!#@My immediate first task was to recruit everybody else immediately important; namely the entirety of puzzle team, the art director, and the build director. Luckily, it wasn’t hard to get puzzle team or the art director, as both the puzzle lead (Sophia) and the art director had worked on Haunt the year before and were interested in continuing. Additionally, I was able to convince two of my friends to join puzzle team, as did Sophia, so puzzle team was pretty much filled pretty quickly.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, finding someone to be the build director was much harder. The previous build director was now a grad student, so we had to start from scratch to find someone else. Eventually, we did get a lone application for build director, which was from someone with no experience with Next Haunt, so I was hesitant. But seeing as how they were the only applicant for the position, we had to accept.!#@p!#@Now that exec is recruited, we use the summer months to start planning for Haunt! The summer months are slow in this regard, but important stuff has to happen in this time for us to be able to do anything in the fall semester. Unfortunately, both the art director and build director were busy during the meetings, so they ended up being just the producers and puzzle team.!#@p!#@At this time though, we ended up on the MBTA theme (at the strong behest of one of the puzzle team members) and started planning out the house flow and puzzles. Importantly, we had to start getting in contact with MIT EHS⁠01 to prep for build in the fall, which is delegated to the build director.!#@p!#@Once August rolled around, we had to lock-in on advertising to the new frosh during REX⁠02 (especially since we cancelled the CPW⁠03 event that normally goes on), which meant we had to take a break from discussing the main event to focus on planning for this. Our REX event is primarily a mini-Haunt, where we recycle some puzzles from the year before and make a smaller version of Next Haunt that we run for the frosh.!#@p!#@In essence, because so much stuff is recycled from the year before, we just had to buy prizes and food for everyone (‘Cause everyone loves free food! This is a common theme this year) and set up the puzzles from last year. Running it wasn’t too bad either; we had one person handling reservations and checking everyone in, and a couple more people acting as scare actors to frighten the froshlings.!#@p!#@Now that September was here, it was time to do everyone’s favorite thing: more recruiting! Around this time, unfortunately, the build director had indicated they were unable to continue fulfilling their role, so we were scrambling to find a replacement.!#@p!#@Normally, for the fall, we recruit for less time-intensive positions so we get frosh. Namely on exec, we recruit art team, a costume designer, assistant build directors, and a sound designer (this year we didn’t recruit for sound specifically because my co-sound designer from last year was returning).!#@p!#@Luckily, we were able to recruit people for every role. We recruited a record of eight art team members (this will be important later). Additionally, we recruited an assistant build director which was very helpful for build. However, we needed more people to help to get this done.!#@p!#@Because of the tight situation we were in, the assistant producers and I decided to just ask the rest of exec if they were able to become build directors as well. Surprisingly, four of the art team members had volunteered to become build directors in addition to the one we recruited. And let me tell you, having the five build directors really saved our asses in regards to getting this house done. We ended up having four build weekends where the house slowly but surely got built. I would love to talk about some of the stories that happened during build, but in the interest of not writing a novel, I’ll have to leave those for another day.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image2-400x180.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image5-e1732575239647-400x256.jpg]!#@After everything is built, now is the main event everyone has been waiting for: the Haunt itself.!#@p!#@I don’t have too much to add to this beyond what Sophia has said already, although I will say that, as Pigeon Man, it is very hard to be very scary when you see people struggling with arithmetic. Also, the bloggers were one out of only two groups to have all of their members escape the MBTA; they only got everyone out because they were three people.⁠04!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image4-e1732575598441-400x647.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image3-e1732575755491-400x454.jpg]!#@Now that everyone was sufficiently scared, EHS required us to take down the building we put our sweat, tears, and blood into (It also takes up the entire Next House basement, so many others were also desiring the destruction of our beautiful piece of art). Thus, every year, we have to do a little thing called strike, where we unbuild the house. Unfortunately, destruction is less tantalizing than construction, so we didn’t get too many people to help strike (I had to pull in a favor to get a friend to help). Luckily, we were able to remove the house from the basement to start Haunt all over again next year.!#@p!#@Except, Haunt isn’t over yet! There is no longer work to be done, but we still gotta celebrate our hard work. Thus, we are planning on having an after-party sometime before finals. This is a Next Haunt tradition, where exec has a dinner where they chill and hang out after everything was said and done, but this stopped because of COVID. But this year, it is coming back with a vengeance! Currently, the plan is to do an escape room with all of exec (very thematic) and then have a dinner with everyone. Once this is over, Next Haunt 2024 can be laid to rest.!#@p!#@Some other fun tidbits I wanted to mention before signing off –!#@p!#@Hopefully from the perspective of those participating in the house (e.g. the above bloggers) everything was fun and epic and scary and definitely all functioning as intended. From the perspective of someone running the house, I can say there were literally zero times where everything functioned exactly as intended.!#@p!#@So then it’s a matter of triaging and deciding what things can be messed-up and is still ok, what things can be messed-up for now but should be changed soon, and what things need to be changed asap for the house to be a fun experience. There was a lot of stuff we were constantly changing on the spot because anticipating things in advance is hard, especially when the thing you’re trying to anticipate is “how will a group of human beings interact with our house, given they are potentially quite frightened but also maybe totally unafraid”.!#@p!#@For instance, from a puzzle perspective, we did a lot of changing how the puzzles worked on the spot because we realized they were too hard. Relatedly huge shoutout to build team for navigating a bunch of unanticipated challenges and still managing to build an entire house. Overall Next Haunt is a huge group effort and its kind of incredible that it all manages to come together, but its super fun to see so many groups of participants have fun with the finished product (we end up having on the order of 80ish groups with 5ish participants each).!#@p!#@Incomplete list of fun behind-the-scenes moments:!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image2-400x180.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image5-e1732575239647-400x256.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image4-e1732575598441-400x647.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image3-e1732575755491-400x454.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-next-haunt-2024-the-haunters/
Things I did instead of thinking by Ellie F. '28,(about decisions),by Ellie F. '28,"November 27, 2024","I know a lot of you are stressed. You have busy brains with rodent teeth that need to chew on something or you’ll grow wild and mad, and so you turn to chewing on college applications. Perhaps you’re like how I was—not-thinking about MIT decisions, much like how a child does not think about the marshmallow in front of her, or how you’re not thinking about a white elephant right now. Maybe, like me, your brain would do better on a different chew toy, brightly colored perhaps, the kind of treat that has nutrition or enrichment like the toys tigers get at the zoo.!#@p!#@I turned to hobbies, making things with my brain and hands⁠01 or just doing the equivalent of dangling some brightly colored yarn in front of a hyper cat. I know it helped me. Maybe it could help you too?!#@p!#@Okay to be fair I’m not that proud of this one. I was semi-addicted to Minesweeper⁠02 in the months leading up to decision day. I could play with absolutely no thought. The numbers and colors burned into my brain until every night, as I started falling asleep, I unconsciously envisioned solving Minesweeper patterns like that scene from Queen’s Gambit with the chess on the ceiling (I never watched Queen’s Gambit so idk if this is actually accurate). This is an actual, documented, studied effect called the Tetris Effect! Aren’t brains cool?!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/minesweeper-1.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/minesweeper-2.png]!#@I’ve been making art my whole life, but I had put it on the back burner as college apps neared. Once those dreaded apps started, though, I suddenly felt that restless urge to study the lines of a ship and the blushes and shadows of a face. In stats I concentrated on the hatching of clouds instead of p-values,⁠03 in comparative government I rushed sloppy notes in favor of drawing the portraits of the economists on the slides.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sketchbook-1-800x520.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sketchbook-2-800x500.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sketchbook-3-800x1219.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/notes-1-800x766.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/notes-2-800x2047.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/notes-3-800x1762.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/notes-4-800x984.png]!#@I also got back into digital art, rediscovering my fascination with bright colors and cool lighting.

I would screenshot pretty liveries I liked and send them to my friends.⁠04 During lunch, or after school, at Quiz Bowl practice, I’d find those pictures to draw in my sketchbook.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/plane-1-800x517.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/plane-2-1-800x464.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/plane-3-800x559.jpg]!#@Puzzlehunts are beautiful collections of clashing ideas, wordplay, obscure references, frustration, and fun. I started puzzling at the end of eighth grade, but as high school dug its claws into me, I found my time to sit down and stare at strange images and confusing crossword clues dwindled. After November 1st, though, I got that itch again. So, we got the band back together (the band being one other puzzly friend) and blew through nearly all of Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2023 and some of Cardinality Puzzle Hunt 2023 05 as well.!#@p!#@Two months later, my near-obsession about puzzlehunts rewarded me with my first group of MIT (and assorted) friends—a bundle of enthusiastic, silly people who I’d stay up late with, chatting and chasing loose threads down Wikipedia rabbitholes and making memes about particularly obstinate puzzles.!#@p!#@I swear I’m not being paid by Big Puzzle, but if any of this sounds interesting to you, you should check out these cool more beginner-friendly puzzles: Colby’s Curious Cookoff, DP, Puzzled Pint (sometimes).!#@p!#@There is nothing quite like making something soft and purple that you can hold in your hands. I learned the basics of crochet over the summer at Mathcamp,⁠06 but one week before a friend’s birthday, I decided it was time to pick up my hook and yarn again, like a retired bank robber accepting one last job with the gang. I never really got the hang of using patterns, but I found I could improvise and Macgyver simple plushies pretty well.!#@p!#@You can make a lot of things with just a few simple skills. You’ll need a crochet hook, a skein of yarn,⁠07 and a yarn needle. I’d recommend learning chain stitch, single crochet, increase, invisible decrease, magic circle, and basic yarn sewing. It sounds like a lot but it really isn’t. For something more fancy, color changes are cool too! Give your friends a yarn heart to make them smile :) Try making yourself a gift of a flower or a cute blobby animal!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/crochet-10-800x957.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/crochet-2-800x890.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/crochet-3-800x800.png]!#@While I was at Math Prize for Girls,⁠08 I was entranced by the instructions for a simple origami cube laid out at our lunch table. Within a few days of returning home, I fell in love with modular origami, folding Sonobe units⁠09 instead of completing homework, looking up tutorials for fancier designs, and tearing and folding so much paper that my fingertips became red and sore. Modular origami has caught many a math lover in its snares, and I love the therapeutic repetition of folding modules, the fun symmetries and colorings of a great stellated dodecahedron, and just holding a 3D paper structure in my hands.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/origami-1-1-800x1530.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/origami-20-800x819.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/origami-2-800x390.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/origami-3-800x2506.jpg]!#@If you’re sitting here with restless hands and an overactive imagination about mid-December, or if you’ve always been thinking of trying a new hobby, or if you miss one you used to love, or if any of the things I’ve described seem interesting to you, then let me, an 18-year-old who was probably once described as wise for her age by an elementary school teacher, encourage you, a cool reader of the MIT blogs, to go for it.

"[Group Post] Next Haunt 2024: The Survivors by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",three bloggers face the horrors of public transit,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","November 27, 2024","Every fall since 2014, Next Haunt puts together a horror-themed escape room in the Next House basement. In my opinion, it’s one of the coolest showcases of student culture here. Students pitch in their talents and skills—ranging from puzzle-making to set design—to put on a spooky show for the MIT community. In 2021, even former MIT president Rafael Reif had dared to escape the horrors!!#@p!#@Despite the fact that I’ve been living at Next House for 3.5 years, I still hadn’t done Next Haunt.!#@p!#@My excuse is that I forgot to sign up in the previous years. But that isn’t entirely true. For one, I get spooked easily. Whenever I entertained the idea of doing a Next Haunt run in the past, the shrieks from the basement would make me change my mind. I’m also not that good at solving puzzles, especially when I’m under pressure. Getting jumpscared in front of friends is one thing. But displaying my intellectual incompetence to them in real time? I could never.!#@p!#@But since this is my senior year, I decided to suck it up and be a big girl. I enlisted the help of my fellow bloggers so we can make it out of Next Haunt alive.!#@p!#@This was also my first year doing Next Haunt! I’d heard many great things about it (one of my friends was even a cast member two years ago), but I was always too lazy to gather a group and sign up. So when Jebby did all the hard work of securing a slot this year, I had no excuse not to sign up.!#@p!#@I really enjoy escape-room-style puzzles, and Next House is famous for housing many nerds clever people who create clever and interesting puzzles, so I was very excited about getting to solve these puzzles. Furthermore, Next Haunt was designed with a few quirks that made these puzzles especially challenging:!#@p!#@The first puzzle we faced was an empty room with a colorful toy xylophone, a combination lock, and various newspaper clippings lining the walls. After a minute of confused silence, we realized that the eerie tune playing in the background was also a part of the puzzle. At first, I tried replaying it on the xylophone, hoping a door would magically open. But then I remembered that we were standing in a wooden box with no electronics inside, so that didn’t work. Instead, Jebby and Aiden noticed that the newspaper clippings were numbered and were about specific MBTA train lines (each corresponding to some color). Using these color-number pairs and the colors of the xylophone, we decoded the combination lock and moved on to the rest of the escape room!!#@p!#@Immediately after entering the next section, a scary-looking zombie wearing a pigeon mask burst into the room and split our team in half, which was unfortunate because we were only a group of three (whereas most people do Next Haunt in groups of five or six). Jebby and Aiden were together in one group, while I was left alone in the other.!#@p!#@Giving me no time to process what had just happened, the pigeon-headed zombie ushered me to the next puzzle (Jebby and Aiden got a different puzzle). My puzzle involved using tarot cards to unscramble a message dispersed between three fortune cookie fortunes. I think the intended solution was to walk around the room and use the clues written on the walls, but instead of doing that, I just sat there staring at the slips of paper and trying to unscramble the message in my head. Somehow, this strategy actually somewhat worked, and I managed to unscramble almost the entire message (mostly because I guessed it would involve numbers)!!#@p!#@“Forty-thr… ifty-six? Aha – 4356! That must be the code to the combination lock in front of me!”!#@p!#@However, the lock would not open, and for two reasons: I was missing some letters from the middle of the message (the correct message was “forty-three times fifty-six”), and (more embarrassingly) I was also trying to open the wrong lock.!#@p!#@At this point, we only had about three minutes left to escape. The pigeon-headed zombie must have felt sorry for us because after witnessing me trying to open the wrong lock, they brought me the correct lock and handed me a TI-84 calculator. (Good call on their end – I would not have been able to do the long multiplication in my head.)!#@p!#@It turned out that my puzzle was the last puzzle we needed to escape! So with just one minute to spare, Aiden, Jebby, and I made it out of Next Haunt alive!!#@p!#@As a fresh-faced MIT first year, it was only recently that I learned of such important MIT Halloween traditions like Next Haunt. I was walking out of the Next dining hall when I saw a poster with a QR code, told my roommates we should sign up, and then instantly forgot about it until I received an invitation from Jebby.!#@p!#@Theoretically, Next Haunt should have been where I really showed off my skills. I have been obsessed with escape rooms and everything even horror-adjacent for years. Plus, I go to MIT, so I should be able to do a simple puzzle, right?!#@p!#@Wrong!!#@p!#@The only MIT “puzzle” (AKA the most complicated, time-consuming, and well-put- together thing you’ve ever seen) I had attempted at MIT so far was when the school rented out the Boston Aquarium for a nighttime party/puzzle-solving-sesh at the end of orientation. Apparently most people didn’t finish despite working almost all three hours on it, but a friend and I immediately gave up and went out to the deck to get churros instead. So much to say, I was not going to be the most helpful at Next Haunt.!#@p!#@This was proven true, the moment we stepped into the pitch-black room that was just a little too claustrophobic, all of my skills, hopes, dreams, and aspirations crumbled. I wasn’t so petrified that I couldn’t talk, but Jebby and I definitely stood in the corner furiously looking around us while Andi did the first puzzle (thanks king!).!#@p!#@Naturally when we were forced to split, Andi, as the smartest and tallest, was forced to be alone, leaving me and Jebby in a room plastered in MBTA maps and an ominous 6:34 written on the wall. And when I tell you that I have never been more grateful that something wasn’t filmed!⁠01 I felt like one of those celebrities that would go on Ellen or Jimmy Fallon and do a horror escape room and just look so incredibly stupid (it was hilarious, though).!#@p!#@The puzzle had us do basic unit conversions (i.e. minutes to hours) to find how long it would take to get from a T stop in Boston back to Next House. Out of generosity, Scary Bird Man visited me and Jebby very frequently to point at the maps in a specific order to give us clues.!#@p!#@He did this so many times that it prompted me to ask if he was disappointed in us, at which he shook his head and just handed us a TI-84. After getting the answer wrong another ~1000 times, we stumbled along the right answer and were handed out silver coins to escape the T.!#@p!#@Since we escaped barely in time, the three of us got to solidify our legacy by writing our names in Sharpies on the list of previous winners.!#@p!#@Overall I am disappointed by how emasculated I felt by the dark, a bird mask, and middle-school algebra, but I am so glad I got to take part in an MIT tradition that I’ll get for the next three years!!#@p!#@Our names are forever immortalized as one of the smartest and bravest souls to pass through Next Haunt. Nobody will know that I shrieked and ran from a guy in a pigeon mask.!#@p!#@On the other hand, Petey and other admissions officers went right after us, and they met the demise that we managed to avoid.!#@p!#@Read Part 2 here!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/group-post-next-haunt-2024-the-survivors/
chances by Kai V. '25,the point is to let yourself be helped,by Kai V. '25,"November 26, 2024","There’s a clear, one-to-one correspondence between the semesters at MIT I consider “successful” and the semesters during which I accepted the most help from and collaboration with others. Freshman spring: I psetted a couple times a week, for two of my classes, with someone who became one of my closer friends here. Junior fall: I went to office hours and recitations consistently. Junior spring: I took the experimental physics capstone, which pairs you with one lab partner for the entire class, and you spend anywhere between 10 and 30 hours a week together. 01!#@p!#@In my experience, the more common way that collaborative problem-solving happens is that one person figures out how to solve the problem and then teaches the other person. To actually solve a problem together, first you need to find a partner whose level of familiarity with the material is around the same as yours, and then it takes time to develop the deep, genuine trust needed to take a person through each step of your problem-solving process when you don’t know yet whether it’s correct. When all the factors align and you really come to a solution together, it feels like the gates to heaven are opening.!#@p!#@All this is to say that successful collaboration is very gratifying. You’ve heard the refrain: it’s what makes the late nights worth it! But it is also hard. It’s so much easier to try and do everything yourself, with no one else to bear witness to your failures—and to avoid having to point out the pitfalls of others. It seems like working with other people should be easy, but it requires a level of vulnerability and trust that has always felt near-impossible for me to put forth.!#@p!#@This goes beyond academics: junior year was so great for me in part because it was the first time I treated my UROP⁠02 meetings as chances to clarify misunderstandings and learn how I could improve my research process, as opposed to being stressed on a weekly basis about having produced enough results for my mentor. For those unfamiliar with the structure of a UROP, here’s how it’s typically gone for me. You work under a Principal Investigator (PI)—a professor who is the head of the lab—but you interact more directly with a graduate student or postdoc who acts as your mentor, meeting with you weekly-ish to go over updates and discuss what you’ll do in the coming week. I’ve been fortunate to only have had supportive UROP experiences with people who seemed invested in my success and wellbeing.!#@p!#@But it still took two years during which I was basically constantly UROPing to understand that those people really wanted to help me. During my first UROP I was always having stress dreams the nights before meetings, thinking about whether I had done enough work, whether I should run a few more simulations, make a few more plots before the meeting. After a second and a third UROP, I seriously wondered whether I would ever be able to hold down a 9-to-5. I would go to the office, and just sitting in the same room as my mentor would fill me with so much anxiety—I mean, on a physical level—my hands would shake, I’d start sweating, feel dizzy, heartbeat through the roof. During the stretches over IAP or summer that I did full-time work, I arrived at the office at 7 a.m. some days or stayed until 7 p.m., worried that showing up later or leaving earlier than my mentor would reveal a fundamental, character-defining laziness. At the core of all this anxiety was the biting fear that my mentor would finally realize how stupid I was and how misguided they had been to allow me on the project.!#@p!#@After a year and a summer of working with my current mentor, finally this fear mostly subsided. I actively look forward to my meetings now, and actually I think the academia ivory tower really popped off when it invented one-on-one mentorship: it’s so educational and productive to have someone much more experienced than myself be so dedicated to my progress! Basically: people forgive you. People are patient. If you’re making a real effort, the right people will always give you more chances.!#@p!#@But sometimes it feels like I’ve missed all my chances. Somehow it took seven semesters for me to learn what’s always been espoused as the core tenet of the MIT undergraduate experience—that you can do much more working together than working alone.!#@p!#@You could say I’ve at least improved since freshman year, but progress is not monotonic. I started out this semester taking 6.2220, Power Electronics Laboratory. It’s a very time-consuming class that I had been really looking forward to. I loved spending time in lab, learning more about the design process, the feeling when I made a circuit work. But I was basically doing everything alone. The thought of going up and putting my name on the help queue sent roiling waves of anxiety through my stomach—instead I’d spend three hours debugging something that could have been resolved simply earlier on had I asked a TA. I didn’t know anyone else in the class and I wasn’t sure how to start talking to anyone. I’d hear everyone else working through problems together around me and wonder if it was too late to try to find some support. But my fear of being perceived as this dumb slow person would win out. Finally, mid-October, some unrelated events happened in my life that made me fall behind on the lab and I dropped the class.!#@p!#@I was really sad about it. I’m a senior and it’s a fall-only class, so now I’ll never be able to take it. I think this could have been avoided if I talked to, like, one person. Even though it’s really hard. You just have to do it. Things here are not really designed to be done alone, or you would be restricted to doing much simpler things.!#@p!#@Even more so than academics, I struggled with socializing. I had a really hard time interacting with most people I knew in my first two years here. What carried me through that time was spouting phrases that conveyed zero information, like a bad AI: “so true bestie” (this one is great because you can say it in response to literally anything), “how’s it going → well, it’s going! *comedic sounds of despair*”, “I’m sooo hosed haha” (I was almost never actually hosed when I said this one), “I only got x hours of sleep last night”, “I have a caffeine addiction”, whatever, whatever. This stream of emptiness that I fell back on because despite my desperate wild flailing I could not, for whatever reason, actually connect with people. Every interaction felt like I was watching myself interact from afar, like there was a glass wall between me and the rest of the world that I might be able to breach if only I said the right thing, and I never did.!#@p!#@I came to MIT being under the impression—based on how intensely the quirky/nerdy student culture is advertised⁠03 —that you find a semblance of family here, people who really understand you for the first time. When this didn’t happen within a year or two (despite putting an intense and genuine effort into four clubs and two living communities) but I saw everyone around me hanging out at 3 a.m. with their New Chosen Family, well, the problem was obviously me. Shouldn’t I have been able to tap into a profound connection with others, by necessity of being at MIT together? 04 I still don’t know why it was so hard then, even with people I thought were super cool, hovering around trying to think of how to start a conversation and keep it going.!#@p!#@But on my third living community, finally I no longer feel like an alien species trying to mimic human interaction. I just, you know, Hang Out with people. It’s awesome. It was totally worth three years of exploration. And it wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t decide to keep being open to friendship, to keep actively trying to find people I might want to stay up until 3 a.m. chatting with, to go on spontaneous late-night trips to Harvard with.!#@p!#@Looking back, I wish I did a lot of things differently. Had I been insistent on working with others from the start, I could have learned a lot more about physics, and math, and electrical engineering. Maybe I would now have the confidence and experience to apply to graduate school in physics, to keep chasing a field that always ruled over my heart even when I didn’t know what in the world I wanted to use it for. And those things I might have learned are things it will be much harder to learn once I leave MIT; some of them, I’m sure, I will never learn.!#@p!#@And yet—when I was a smol confused freshman, my UROP mentor, who was endlessly patient and wise and whom I was nevertheless intimidated as hell by, taught me emacs and Linux and the entire mindset I use to think about research problems now. As a sophomore, all those clubs I joined and dropped out of showed me what I didn’t want to pursue in the future. As a junior—well, no notes, 10/10 year. And as a senior, I realize—long overdue—that there are plenty of people at MIT for me to find profound, deep connections with, or just to laugh at memes with.!#@p!#@So here is what I learned, floundering around feeling alone, even if I missed out on some physics and math in the process. That you should keep trying, again and again, that even when connection feels elusive, at the end of the day it’s the only thing you have, and that alone makes it worth the effort. That people really want to help you, and you should let them.

And the Whistle Blows by Emiko P. '25,soccer post-season & my last competitive soccer game,by Emiko P. '25,"November 21, 2024","Soccer season is officially over. Holy smokes does time fly. It feels like I just stepped on campus to begin preseason, and now I’m handing in my practice gear and taking down the decorations in my locker.!#@p!#@So, how exactly did the rest of our season go? In my last update, I regaled you about our successful regular season. Which leaves me to tell you about how our post-season went.!#@p!#@Winning our regular season conference title and securing the #1 seed in the conference tournament was cool and all, but what we really wanted was the big shiny silver trophy you get for being the conference tournament champion.!#@p!#@To get our hands on that trophy, we had to play 3 games in one week, reuniting with opponents that we had already played (and beat) previously during the regular season. Here are the results of that week.!#@p!#@With our Saturday win against WPI, we officially became NEWMAC TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS RAHHHHHH!! We snatched up that silver trophy and checked off a huge goal on our season bucket list! It really doesn’t get much better than a conference championship :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newmac-champs-400x225.png]!#@Any team that wins their conference championship automatically gets a bid to the D3 NCAA tournament, which is the national tournament. We absolutely had our sights on performing well and going far in this tournament. My freshman year, we got as far as the Elite Eight, but this year we were unfortunately knocked out in the Round of 32. We won our first game against SUNY Geneseo 3-1, but lost the very next day to Colby College 2-0. We ended our season with a record of 21-2-1, and we tied MIT soccer’s longest winning streak ever at 15 games. And just like that, our season was over.!#@p!#@But not only was our season over, but suddenly so was my 15 year competitive soccer career.!#@p!#@When I was in seventh grade, I broke my foot.⁠01 My dad told me that he found me crying one day, wearing my new boot, saying, “I only have ten more years left of soccerrrrrrr.” The only way I would possibly be able to play ten more years of soccer at the time was if I was planning on playing in college. My dad had never considered the fact that I would want to play in college, and honestly, I hadn’t thought about it either. I guess this specific instance was the moment when college soccer became a conscious idea in my mind.!#@p!#@It is almost absurd to think that the time my seventh-grade self had been dreading – that distant ten-year future where I would one day be done playing competitive soccer – has finally come. Time flies, man.!#@p!#@Honestly, talking about soccer right now is kind of hard. It’s only been a few days, and it’s hard to process how I most likely won’t play competitive soccer again. Soccer has been the common denominator that my life at MIT has revolved around. Every weeknight from 5 to 7 pm is spent out on a turf field. Nearly every Wednesday is a bus trip to a random liberal arts college somewhere in the Northeast. Saturdays are spent on Roberts field, friends and family in the stands. Not to mention the physical part of it all: the feeling of sprinting after a loose ball, running despite a cramp in your side, shaking your legs as the winter chill creeps into your muscles – all these feelings are replaced by eerie quiet and stillness now that the season is over. They are replaced by an antsy anticipation, by the sensation that your muscles should be doing something.!#@p!#@I worked out for the first time since our season ended, and I’m trying to find ways to deal with this sudden loss of purpose. If I’m not working out to get stronger and faster on the soccer field, then what am I working out for? For literally my entire life, my motivator to push through the pain of every workout, to hold my plank for just 15 seconds longer, to add weight to the squat bar, to push myself just one more lap around the track, has been so that I can be a better soccer player.!#@p!#@Now what?!#@p!#@I wonder what new purpose I will find to motivate me. Maybe there’s a way to be optimistic about all this. After all, there is a certain sense of freedom that comes with my ties to competitive soccer being abruptly snipped. I know I love athletics, so maybe I will pick up new sports or activities. Maybe I will dance more. Maybe I will play tennis. Maybe I will do yoga. And I guess my time playing soccer hasn’t entirely ended. I will no doubt be tearing it up on the pickup fields at MIT and lifting with the soccer team until I graduate.!#@p!#@All that’s left now is to be thankful. Thanks to my coaches, who believed in me every step of the way. That belief has now become a fundamental part of my being. I’ll carry that “swag”⁠02 with me now wherever I go. Thanks to my teammates throughout the years, who are now spread all over the country, but especially to the ones here with me now in Cambridge. The soccer team has been the home that has raised me since I was a freshman at MIT, and I hope that me and the other seniors have done our part in maintaining that home this year. You all will do amazing things (including win a National Championship for us hopefully). Thanks to all the trainers, who have patched up every inch of my body at this point and who are one of the few that can say they’ve been present for all the ups and downs of an athlete’s journey. Thanks to the friends and family of the soccer team, who are always there to wave when you look into the crowd and who are always there to feed us goodie bags after games. Thanks to the soccer alumni, who were one of the first to hug the seniors after we played our final game and who have always cheered so loud that we can hear them from across the country.!#@p!#@Wow, I will miss it. I will miss the feeling of slamming into another girl to steal a ball, flying and jumping to win a header, wanting to win so badly it consumes you. I will miss it all. The energy. The people. The joy.!#@p!#@What a journey.!#@p!#@As always, from now until forever, roll tech!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newmac-champs-400x225.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/and-the-whistle-blows/
"FYI: Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting in 2025 by Chris Peterson SM '13",what it says on the tin,by Chris Peterson SM '13,"November 20, 2024","First, let me start with a venerable and ancient blogger apology: sorry for not blogging much lately. With my new-ish role —  Director of Communications and Special Projects — I am doing more writing than ever, but the kind that is often read by a half dozen people within MIT. It’s sort of like playing Elden Ring on a dex/faith build: small, fast melee weapons with the occasional distance spellcasting.⁠01!#@p!#@Anyway, here is today’s Golden Vow, via MIT News:!#@p!#@You can read more in the article, but basically, in Admissions and SFS, we are mission-driven to make MIT a magnet for the most talented students in the world interested in an education centered on science and technology, and to make it accessible to the best students regardless of their financial circumstances. That’s why our financial aid meets full need, our admissions is need-blind, and we don’t have an admissions preference for the children of alumni or donors (which can be seen in the public data from economists at Opportunity Insights). We hope that these new, clearly communicable policies⁠02 will help make everyone understand that if they are admitted to MIT, they will be able to afford to attend.

🦆🦆🦆🏳️🏳️🏳️ 🦖🦖🦖 by Ellie F. '28,SIMMONS!!! RETREAT!!!,by Ellie F. '28,"November 17, 2024","153 minutes before the deadline to sign up for the Simmons Retreat, I got an email. We noticed you filled out the interest form, it said, but that you haven’t filled out the binding form. I had already accepted that I couldn’t go—I had promised to go to a Puzzle Club event on Monday, when I expected the retreat would still be going on. But a short email exchange later, I realized we actually would be back in time.!#@p!#@I’ll fill out the form, then, I responded. tysm!!!#@p!#@The Simmons Retreat was taking place over our student holiday, from Saturday, October 12th to Monday, October 14th at our Heads of House’s cabin in Concord, MA. As we drove, I briefly considered working on my crochet, but I got carsick without even completing a single round. Instead, I watched the trees whisk by as I defended myself against accusations that I had actually snuck out and painted all the leaves red and orange and gold and yellow. Don’t be silly, I laughed. That would take forever, and you know I had midterms all this week. I only painted one or two, the yellow ones, near Simmons.!#@p!#@They said the cabin would be on a pond but we all agreed it was a lake. We poked around the cabin and its airy rooms and dog beds, and then we dispersed to unpack and set up our beds. We got a tour of the cabin, and then three of us went outside to draw trees. I don’t know what I’m doing, we all said. My sketch isn’t really very good. The drawings were all beautiful.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lake-1-800x360.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lake-2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cabin-3-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cabin-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@After lunch, we traipsed through the yellow-orange woods. On the way, we saw the shell of a blue car, and we chained together clover flowers until we reached Merrill Farms. I fawned over little bees and bright petals and tried to tuck flowers into hair. As we headed back, the sun sank low and lit up blades of grass, and I lingered a bit behind the group, making conversation without really knowing what I was saying, and feeling like this all was a little bit too fantastical to be real.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flower-2-800x1422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-6-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-7-800x600.jpg]!#@In the evening, a few of us practiced choreography for DanceTroupe, and after we ate and cleaned up dinner and dessert, we talked about Simmons, astronomy, and song lyrics. At night, I danced in the dark and tried to map out all the stars I couldn’t see from Cambridge.!#@p!#@The next day, after breakfast, we went apple picking, a quintessential fall thing that I had never been aware of. All us freshmen banded together as a troop, marching through the forest to the far side of the orchard on recommendation by one of the employees. I skipped ahead and darted back like an overexcited labrador retriever. I finally get the appeal of biting into apples, I thought to myself, after indulging in my first apple straight off the branch. This is SO much better than the ones in the dining halls.!#@p!#@We filled our bags and stomachs with varieties of apples I’ve never heard of. Then, we browsed the farm store, digging through gourds of various shapes and sizes and contemplating whether the price of a pie was worth it. The rest of our group found us there, and we shared cider and donuts under the misty rain.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-11-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-2-3-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-3-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-4-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-5-800x600.jpg]!#@When we got back, we dispersed onto various couches and chairs to get some feeling back into our fingers and to work, or in my case, play UC Love. Since we had apples, of course we had to bake, and though I’m mostly useless in the kitchen, I’m something of an artist, myself. Jesus CHRIST what is that thing?? said someone (probably). I think I need more dough, I said.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-1-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-3-800x1067.jpg]!#@I had a hard time the week before retreat. I was stressed and alone, spending my free time hunched over my desk studying for dreaded midterms. Every night, I curled up in my comfort hoodie, in bed far earlier than usual. The Simmons Retreat was what I needed to take a step back and revel in the beauty of the fall and the warmth of my friends. MIT is a neverending waterfall. It’s the Energizer Bunny that keeps going and going and going. But I can keep going too, and share some warm cider with my friends on the way.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lake-1-800x360.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lake-2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cabin-3-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cabin-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flower-2-800x1422.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-3-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-6-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flowers-7-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-11-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-2-3-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-3-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-4-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-5-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-1-800x450.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pie-3-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/%f0%9f%a6%86%f0%9f%a6%86%f0%9f%a6%86%f0%9f%8f%b3%ef%b8%8f%f0%9f%8f%b3%ef%b8%8f%f0%9f%8f%b3%ef%b8%8f-%f0%9f%a6%96%f0%9f%a6%96%f0%9f%a6%96/
*THE* double by Veronica P. '27,a room tour from an (only slightly) obnoxious duo,by Veronica P. '27,"November 17, 2024","Meet my roommate and me:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC00530-1-800x1422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC00532-800x1422.jpg]!#@I’m not quite sure when it happened, but if I had to guess it was sometime around 3 am, sharing food on the sofa of our freshman year suite and undoubtedly procrastinating far more important matters—!#@p!#@“If we’re doubling together, I feel like we could really lock into making our room, like, the best room ever.”!#@p!#@“Oh not just any double, THE double.”!#@p!#@And thus, The Double was born.!#@p!#@The inception of this idea sent us down a pinterest-boarding, wishlist-making, room-blue-printing spiral. By the time we said our goodbyes in May, The Double was already a space in our minds. Sometimes, when I found myself gazing for long enough upon my childhood bedroom— the one that, post-graduation, felt eerily like every bit of me that I’d thought I’d outgrown or discarded— I’d close my eyes and visit that corner of my mind, letting our brainchild buoy me back to Boston.!#@p!#@Soon enough, of course, we found ourselves actually back on campus— our return expedited by promises to help our floor (Burton One!) run events for all of the newcomers to our building. And while that promise probably took a year off our lives — story for another time?— it gave us time to lock into the double before classes came around. As soon as we got the chance, we borrowed a car and headed out to Cambridge Antiques and IKEA, resolved to finish The Double by the next day.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-17-at-5.56.50 PM-400x297.png]!#@Well, until we developed the motto, “The Double is never finished” — tapping into some optimism that each new outing presented the chance to find another addition to our home.!#@p!#@And, three months into The Double, I can confirm that quite a bit has been added.

tick tick tick by Kanokwan T. '25,and the euphoria of it stopping,by Kanokwan T. '25,"November 16, 2024","content warning: mental health, academic stress, burnout!#@p!#@The institute is always churning.!#@p!#@There’s a constant sound in the back of my head, a whirring that keeps my mind thinking about what I need to do next, instead of what I’m doing right now.!#@p!#@This is a place that never sleeps.⁠01 Even in the quietest moments of the night, you can find someone mulling away over work. Any time of day I walk through campus—like the rare and dreadful 4am stroll from a campus library back to my dorm—I will bump into at least several people. At least I know that I’m not alone.!#@p!#@I’m fucking exhausted.!#@p!#@Have I done anything worthwhile here? It feels like I haven’t used my time wisely at all. It feels like I’ve done nothing for this school. I’ve squandered my opportunities. I’ve messed up real, reaaaaaaaal bad.!#@p!#@Nothing feels right; everything feels wrong.!#@p!#@MIT is offering me so much opportunity. How dare I feel like this is all too much? I should be more grateful.!#@p!#@It’s such a privilege to be here. I’m really fortunate to be able to do everything I want to do.!#@p!#@Would someone please acknowledge all of the hard work I’ve put in? God. In high school, it felt like I got some form of a gold star every week. An award of sorts, a good test grade, positive affirmation directly from my teacher, whatever. It was much easier to do exceptional things and be recognized for it. Now, I get nothing.!#@p!#@Everyone here is brilliant. How the fuck did I get in?!#@p!#@I’m just going to shut up, put my nose to the grindstone, and stick it out until the next long break. I can make it if I just focus and let nothing get in my way.!#@p!#@I feel like despite operating at my max capacity, I’m just barely scraping by. I’m doing the bare minimum. I’m average at best. Why can’t I excel anymore? I’m just barely keeping it together.!#@p!#@Why am I taking this class again? Why am I in this club? Why am I doing… any of this???!#@p!#@I can’t get peace here. I feel insane.!#@p!#@The firehose is real. There is simply so, so much going on. Heavy coursework. Abundant extracurriculars. Boston festivities. And everything else in-between.!#@p!#@MIT classes take so much god damn work.⁠02 Students can join basically any club they want, which is dangerous, because they want it all.⁠03 And, people here aren’t scared of having fun, so we embody “work hard play hard” culture, but, my god, do I wish it didn’t have to be so hard??????? Can’t we simply just work and play? Without the hard part? Please?!#@p!#@I will not let this institute break me.!#@p!#@I love the challenge. In high school, I often had to push myself because I wasn’t challenged enough. Now, at a school that truly pushes me, I feel like I’m finally able to reach my potential.!#@p!#@I feel like I can’t stop. I’m not allowed to. If I do, I wouldn’t be making the most of my time here. And that would be regretful.!#@p!#@I feel like I don’t understand anything on a deep level in any of my classes. I could, but I simply can’t make the time to. Once an assignment is turned in, I can’t reflect; I have to pour hours into the next one immediately. This is frustrating because I want to develop mastery of the content, and that is something that MIT prides itself in. But, I have to move on. I have to keep my head held high.!#@p!#@I’m a failure. I’m doing so much. And, in doing far too much, I have done nothing.!#@p!#@Sometimes, in trying to do all of the things, I’ve lost sight of why I’m doing anything. I’ve had to take moments to step back and ask myself: What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Is this something I truly want to continue?!#@p!#@But, I don’t have time to think about these things right now. If I do, I won’t be able to stay on pace with everything in my life. I just have to keep going.!#@p!#@I’ve never felt more understood by others. Everyone at MIT is such a beautiful nerd at heart. And, even though we’re all toughing it out in some way, we go through it together. We show we care. We show up for each other.!#@p!#@I feel stupid. I made poor decisions that got me into this state where my mind can’t take any breaks.!#@p!#@I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I’m just trying to keep my head afloat in this storm I’ve inflicted onto myself.!#@p!#@I should get dinner with my friend. Work is important, but meals and friends are also important. I wonder if they’ve also had a lot of racing thoughts.!#@p!#@Man, this is hard to go through alone, but maybe they’re doing just fine, and I’m the only one struggling. Maybe I won’t tell them. I don’t want to come off as dumb and weak.!#@p!#@I… should probably tell them what’s going on in my head. These floodgates are going to break one way or another, and we might as well endure the tides together. I should ask if they’re okay with receiving this kind of information right now—my struggles and all. I think they’ll understand.!#@p!#@Oh.!#@p!#@Wow.!#@p!#@They were experiencing eerily similar things and were glad I brought it up. I was freaking out over bringing up my struggles and for what? It feels good to be seen, to be understood.!#@p!#@I’m… not alone?!#@p!#@We’re not alone.!#@p!#@No one here is alone.!#@p!#@MIT is a fucking tough school, but it has even tougher students to get through it.!#@p!#@They made me feel like everything was going to be okay, and I think I did the same for them. Together, we reworked our plans to make life more manageable: taking late days, seeking extra tutoring, or stepping back from a club. It’s hard to figure out what truly matters sometimes, but having someone to help prioritize makes a world of difference.!#@p!#@I think everything’s gonna be okay. ☺!#@p!#@I want to do so many things, but I have to remind myself: I am only one person, and I need to spend my time wisely.!#@p!#@What really matters to me?!#@p!#@These four years will pass quickly, but if I focus on that question, I’ll walk out stronger, better, and ready for whatever comes next.!#@p!#@After bridging that topic, we started catching up on each others’ lives.!#@p!#@For the latter half of our conversation, we talked about music a lot. We indulged on our recent favorite drops. Some summery pop hits, a tinge of psychedelic rock, a looot of bossa nova.!#@p!#@There are many concerts in Boston! We expressed being grateful to be in a city where music was like air; it was everywhere. We talked about going to an alt rock concert or jazz bar together this weekend.!#@p!#@Wait… how had that many hours gone by?!#@p!#@It felt like time stopped for a moment, and it was just us.!#@p!#@Friends spending quality time together.!#@p!#@As they say, I guess time flies when you’re around people you love.!#@p!#@04!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/tick-tick-tick/
Mathisms by Allison E. '27,and other linguistic quirks of the nerd incubator,by Allison E. '27,"November 15, 2024","There exists a nontrivial subset of the MIT population for whom the intersection of their everyday language and mathematical jargon is non-empty.!#@p!#@In other words, MIT is overrun with math people who cannot help but speak in tongues math gibberish. It’s almost inevitable in this little cauldron of nerds. You start with a soup of universally strong math backgrounds, then toss in a couple hundred ultra math nerds, and a couple hundred more ultra ultra math nerds, and suddenly you can smell the scent of math wafting into the next room. It’s in the name, after all–the Mathachusetts Institute of Technology.!#@p!#@Now, you may have heard of some of our linguistic quirks before. For example, many know that MIT’s buildings aren’t named, but rather numbered. Or that we introduce our majors by number (“I’m a Course 16⁠01 ”). Or that we throw around class numbers with reckless abandon⁠02 . But that’s only scratching the tip of the surface here. It gets much worse.!#@p!#@However, as the token non-math person of a very mathy friend group, today I shall serve as a questionably accurate translator between you, dear reader, and the cauldron math degeneracy. This is not a rigorous⁠03 case study, but it does use (mostly) real quotes I’ve heard around campus. Let us begin :)!#@p!#@Example: “This is almost orthogonal to the previous discussion”
Translation: “This is almost completely unrelated to the previous discussion”
Explanation: In math, ‘orthogonal’ means perpendicular, or forming a right angle with something. People generally use it to mean ‘unrelated,’ the way ‘tangential’ is used to mean ‘only vaguely related before branching off completely into lalaland’ (the way that a line tangent to a circle moves with the circle for only a moment before diverging). 9/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4961-400x463.jpeg]!#@Example: “There exists a future in which I drop this class”
Translation: “I might drop this class”
Explanation: ‘There exists’ is just a fancy way to say ‘there is,’ while simultaneously making the syntax way more complicated than necessary. It’s just a way to sound fancy. 5/10!#@p!#@Example: “This is just a subset of my thoughts”
Translation: “These are just some of my thoughts”
Explanation: According to Wikipedia, a set A is a subset of a set B if all elements of A are also elements of B. For example, ‘dogs’ are a subset of ‘mammals’ because all dogs are mammals. ‘Mammals’ is not a subset of ‘dogs,’ because not all mammals are dogs. I think this is mainly used just to sound fancy–you can say ‘some’ with the same meaning. 6/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4962-400x368.jpeg]!#@Example: “This PSet is taking me a nontrivial amount of time”
Translation: “This PSet is taking me a while”
Explanation: The word ‘trivial’ is SO common at MIT. I don’t think I ever heard it in everyday conversation before coming here, but technically some normal people do generally use it as something like ‘unimportant’ or ‘insignificant.’ In math contexts, though, ‘trivial’ generally refers to something that’s relatively simple or straightforward to show/prove. For example, a trivial solution to the Pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 is a = 0, b = 0, and c = 0. People at MIT use both definitions– ‘insignificant’ and ‘easy’⁠04 –and then apply it to everything. You cannot escape the trivial. 8/10!#@p!#@Example: “It’s getting warm, I’m going to open the window by epsilon”
Translation: “I’m going to open the window a bit”
Explanation: The lowercase Greek letter epsilon (ε) is often used to denote a very small number. I’ve seen it mostly when analyzing what happens to a system (such as a pendulum) if you give it a small nudge in one direction, and in everyday conversation it means the same thing. This one is unusual in that it’s mainly a notation convention, which is kinda fun. 7/10!#@p!#@Example: “Should the laws be changed such that the state has less power?”
Translation: “Should the laws be changed so that the state has less power?”
Explanation: I think you can usually replace ‘such that’ with ‘so that,’ but there are subtle nuances. After 20 minutes of research, contemplation, and attempted synthesis of the thoughts generated, I gave up and asked ChatGPT, who gave me an annoyingly perfect categorization: ‘so that’ refers to purpose or intention, while ‘such that’ refers to a condition or exact criteria to be met. For example, “I cooked so that I could feed all my friends” implies that the purpose is to feed all my friends, while “I cooked such that I could feed all my friends” implies that I made so much food that I satisfy the condition of being able to feed all my friends, but not necessarily that I intend to do so. Usually this nuance doesn’t matter, though. Just say ‘so that’… 5/10!#@p!#@Example: “There are like… n mushrooms… where n is a small number”
Translation: “There’s not a lot of mushrooms”
Explanation: I simply have no explanation, and was *this* close to throwing said mushrooms at this person. -100/10!#@p!#@Example: “My brain’s signal to noise ratio is very low”
Translation: “If I have any useful thoughts, they’re generally drowned out by the incessant muttering of my inner demons” \hj
Explanation: ‘Signal-to-noise ratio’ is a measurement of the strength of a signal to the strength of its background noise. For example, the further away you are from a radio station, the more your signal-to-noise-ratio drops and the harder it is to make out the music (signal) amidst the static (noise). I’m actually quite partial to this one–it’s so poetic. 10/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4966-400x281.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4964-400x426.jpeg]!#@Example: “I wish there were more people with Ellie-magnitude personalities”
Translation: “I wish there were more people with personalities as large/fun/cool as Ellie” (name replaced)
Explanation: In technical use, ‘magnitude’ refers to the size of something, and is often denoted as the absolute value. I don’t actually hear this one very often (besides in “this is orders of magnitude better than expected” cases), but I thought it was funny.!#@p!#@Example: “We have reached critical mass to start class”
Translation: “We have enough people here that it makes sense to start class”
Explanation: In nuclear physics, critical mass is the minimum amount of material needed to keep a nuclear reaction alive. It’s a pretty good phrase for social situations, because you often need a minimum number of people to make things happen. Probably not as unique to nerd world, though. 7/10!#@p!#@Example: “I’m grading this question alone–we have 8 people for 5 questions, so by pigeonhole…”
Translation: “We have 8 people for 5 questions, so there have to be at least 2 questions that only have 1 grader each.”
Explanation: According to Wikipedia, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. It’s mainly common sense (if you have 3 pigeons and 2 holes, at least 1 hole has to have more than 1 pigeon), but it’s often used in proofs. I’ve somehow heard this come up in more than one conversation–in fact, a friend who was also present for this example anticipated where it was going and CHIMED IN SIMULTANEOUSLY with “by pigeonhole” 😭.  2/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4965-400x227.jpeg]!#@Example: ”Let’s parallelize–you chop the cabbage while I caramelize the onions”
Translation: “Let’s split up the tasks that can be done simultaneously–”
Explanation: In computer science, parallel processing is when you use multiple processors to do different parts of a job. In particular, though, the mini-tasks must not depend on each other–i.e. chopping cabbage doesn’t require that onions first be caramelized, or vice versa. There’s no real purpose to using ‘parallelize,’ but I think parallel processing is a cool concept, and I think it’s useful to remind ourselves that we have to work on tasks that don’t depend on each other. 9/10!#@p!#@Example: “When I cook, I usually just take the intersection of a bunch of recipes” – my roommate, making the best food I’ve ever eaten because she is amazing and also my hero⁠05
Translation: “I usually look at a bunch of recipes and use the ingredients mentioned by all of them”
Explanation: In math, the ‘intersection’ of two groups is all the items that fall in both groups. For example, apples are in the intersection of [fruits] and [red things], because they’re both fruits and red things. My friend used ‘intersection’ to mean exactly this, and I actually quite like it. If you know the other person will understand it, it saves several words and a convoluted explanation. 9/10!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4963-400x447.jpeg]!#@Example: My friend, walking down a hill: “gradient descent!!!!”
Translation: “We’re going down a hill!!!”!#@p!#@Example: “He’s updating his weights!!”
Translation: “He’s changing his opinions/understanding after hearing us talk!”(?)!#@p!#@Example: “I need more training data to understand this >:(”
Translation: “I need more practice problems/examples/experiences”!#@p!#@Explanation: I’m not competent enough to actually explain all this machine learning stuff, so uhhh if you’re curious the 3Blue1Brown videos are a great intro. Suffice to say, we’ve started talking about ourselves as machine learning models… The lure of computer science has sunk its talons into us, and it’s begun to draw blood. Send help. 4/10!#@p!#@Example: 
My roommate: “Late days exist for a reason”
Me: “This is a true statement”
Me: *realizes what I just said*
Me: *pitches self out the nearest window*
Translation: “Yeah”
Explanation: Before coming to MIT, I would say ‘ah yeah that’s true…’ occasionally, but I’d never heard anyone except my mom say ‘this is true.’ Unfortunately, however, ‘this is true’ is SO common here, and I’ve resigned myself to falling victim. BUT STILL. I genuinely can’t believe that the words ‘this is a true statement’ passed my lips completely unironically… I suppose even I, a non-math person, am susceptible to the allure of mathisms. Either that or the 6.121⁠06 proofs have warped my brain 😭. -20/10!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4961-400x463.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4962-400x368.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4966-400x281.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4964-400x426.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4965-400x227.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4963-400x447.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mathisms/

'28,"November 13, 2024","I’ll cut to the chase: it’s November, which means that a lot of the people stumbling across the blogs are among the tens of thousands of anxious students and family members who are going through the college application season, and are either trying to vibe out whether they want to apply to MIT, or they already have and now must wait a grueling amount of time to figure out their admission status.!#@p!#@Essentially, nausea is in the crisp autumn air for a lot of you.!#@p!#@And, as an elder now,⁠01 I can tell you that I was nauseous once, too. But as a self-confirmed psychic, the tragic fate I had predicted for myself had unfortunately come true.!#@p!#@This is how I got rejected from my “dream school”, and how I got into this one.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@Throughout middle school and high school, one of my best friends and I had a pact: go to Stanford. We famously donned matching Stanford hoodies together and became annoyingly giddy at the mention of anything Stanford related. I left it to her to decide why, exactly. My younger ears knew that it was a very prestigious school in sunny California, and I was sold. My “dream school” had been decided, an unknown blood oath I had taken to extort myself for the next five years towards an ambiguous goal of being a college student not just anywhere, but at a very specific college (if it sounds ridiculous written out bluntly, that’s because it is).!#@p!#@It’s not as if I didn’t want to go to Stanford initially, but the attachment solidified as years of romanticization played out over my Google tabs as I looked at classes I could take, majors I could choose, and dorms I could live in. Some people around me–my mom who went to her state school where she was guaranteed automatic admission, friends who were only applying to CSU a mile up the road–initially thought our commitment to Stanford was stupid. I find this sentiment troubling. To the extent that we want to inspire younger generations to always go after their dreams and simultaneously put so much pressure on higher education, it’s only natural that high schoolers begin to subscribe to the mentality that a college is one of the most important factors in their future. It’s not stupid to feel passionate about a process you but so much of yourself into.!#@p!#@So when the summer before senior year hit, I was nothing more than a floating body trying to find the creative will to write application essays. The first thing I learned? I’m awful at lying. While I tried to turn every prompt into a story about self-growth and perseverance, everyone I had peer review the essays saw right through it. I’m naturally very pessimistic, so it was as if someone took a Disney Channel version of my real personality and plastered it across the page with words stolen from Thesaurus.com.!#@p!#@This was my worst nightmare. I had to be the ideal, happiest, most developed 17 year old that Stanford had ever seen, radiating nothing but joy and optimism and intelligence that I could uniquely bring to their campus. Except I have never in my life had enough self-confidence to be optimistic or believe that I truly had something to bring to the table. This was especially true when I forced myself into the rabbit hole of college-applications YouTube.⁠02 My application to Stanford felt like the most unrealistic goal I had, but also the one I put the most pressure on.!#@p!#@College applications are hard because they are simultaneously the most intense and the most fabricated self-reflection you’ve probably done. It’s not every year that we are forced to reexamine ourselves to ask if we are good enough not just for a school or a job, but a lifestyle that is being sold to us.!#@p!#@I eventually submitted my application feeling less than okay about it, and then the gaslighting came. I understand that, yet again, this is the optimism I always fail to see, but the incessant reassurance from everyone I know “that you’re definitely getting in!” just increased the pressure. With how and where I grew up, I was never expected to necessarily “go far” by traditional measures of success. So when I decided I would try, it felt like I had something to prove. Now that everyone believed this mirage I had put up, it had to stay, when really nobody but me cared.!#@p!#@Next was the interview. As both a people pleaser and someone trying to be accommodating to the person who could decide the fate of my application, I skipped class to drive 20 minutes to a coffee shop on the CSU campus. We sat outside despite heavy winds, which I insisted were fine because the interviewer wanted to sit there.!#@p!#@It was awful.⁠03 I normally don’t have interview anxiety or difficulty talking to adults, but I sobbed in my car for an hour after and called my friend to tell her that there was no way we were both getting in anymore. It already felt like the life I had desired for the past 5 years was being stripped from me without my control.!#@p!#@At that point I thought my chances were pretty low. Still, for the week before decisions were released, my head was foggy and my anxiety was spiking. My friend and I were at a debate tournament in Cheyenne the day they came out, which both helped and hurt the process. They were released a 6:00 P.M., immediately before we had to go argue about federal student loans. I knew I would feel better if I could immediately be distracted after, so I opened it immediately. My friend knew for a fact that, despite how much it killed her putting it off longer, she had to wait until we were leaving the tournament so that she could find out alone.!#@p!#@Neither of us got in.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@What people don’t really talk about past their disappointment of getting rejected is how much the pity stings. In an instant everyone around me switched their tune from “you’re destined for Stanford, the greatest school in the world” to “that stupid school doesn’t deserve you anyway”. Whether or whether not either is true, it still felt weird.!#@p!#@What else people don’t talk about is how lonely it feels, putting yourself out there to be judged by an anonymous panel only to be rejected. The process can echo a lot of insecurities we already hold for ourselves, forcing us to trace a mental list of every way we think we don’t compare, asking what reason it was we don’t deserve something we wanted. I am a deeply regretful and nostalgic person. To my core I feel the weight of every decision and life path constantly weighing on me, the heaviness of not getting what I want sits like an anvil on my chest.!#@p!#@But at some point, time has to move on.!#@p!#@One of my debate coaches used her phone to draw over the Dean of Admission’s face with crude images, and I guess that was the first step to moving on. Step two was repeating the process, another dozen times in the 30 days left I had left to submit applications. Because just like any dream, if you lose it you must find another. And I did that by applying to every other school I could in order to compensate for what I felt like I lost. When you plan everything out so intensely, every other path, even the better ones, seems like settling for the life you decided on. But as I eventually began researching other colleges, I noticed something: they’re all the same.!#@p!#@Okay, they’re not all the same, but in the aspects I thought mattered they are. Lot of studies show that it is not what school you go to that determines how successful or happy you are, but the general work ethic and accomplishments you have that make you “qualified” to attend prestigious schools. Anything hyper-specific about one school you can create for yourself at another. The only thing that does change are the location and the name–everything else is what you make it to be. I noticed everything I had admired at Stanford exists in some form at another school–schools like MIT (among others, of course).!#@p!#@Before I found out about Stanford, I hadn’t really thought about applying to MIT. The same friend was planning to apply, so I decided to make an application on the website and put it on the back end, only completing it if I had extra time. That “extra time” turned out to mean I didn’t open the application again until noon the day it was due. I didn’t have a lot of time to create entirely new essays, so I reworded some I had used for other schools and sent it in.!#@p!#@It was only after I applied that I truly started to discover what MIT had for me. I never thought I would get in, but I went down YouTube spirals watching cheesy “Day In My Life At MIT” vlogs⁠04 and read a backlog of blog content anyway. From January to March, MIT transformed from one of the schools I wasn’t going to apply into one of my top choices. Even then (though I swore I wouldn’t attach myself to one school), MIT wasn’t atop the mental ranking I had made of the rest of the schools I applied to.⁠05!#@p!#@It turns out I got into some I wanted. I also got rejected from 9 others. And while of course there was excitement, committing is still a tolling process, no matter where you go. It’s officially turning away from what feels like every other life you could’ve had. But what people forget is that you are smart enough and capable enough to be able to do well in more than one environment.!#@p!#@Right now, I am taking probably the same classes with the same demographics of people that I would at almost any other school. And while my life will differ because of the minute details, my “college lifestyle” per se is not something that was bequeathed to me during orientation week, something that only comes from the soil of Killian Court. If you are passionate enough to even apply for a place like MIT, you are 100% going to be fine, even if not at MIT.!#@p!#@I’m not going to tell you that it doesn’t hurt, but I will tell you that you’re strong enough to get over it, however long it takes. And I do still think about Stanford, but definitely less. Like all pain, it doesn’t go away, but instead escapes into the background for you to move on.!#@p!#@I know that if on the day I got rejected from Stanford a student wrote to me saying “You’re going to do great things! Just not here babe :( “, I would have immediately punched them in the throat as violently as possible without remorse. I also know that when I meet people now who have gone to Stanford, I just ask how they like it, have a mini-daydream about “what if I went there”, and then move on because I probably have a pset to do for the college I actually attend. I also know that there are people reading this who will get into Stanford and not MIT.!#@p!#@Some of you will get to live out my “dream”, I might be living out yours. But at some point when you look back on wherever you’ve been, your dream will be going back to what you had and not what you didn’t.!#@p!#@So just breathe, take a nap, eat a sandwich, and make a mood board or something until decisions are released.⁠06!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-if-i-get-rejected/
I tried* to run to the airport by Kayode D. '27,*thank you Noah and Sydney for saving my life,by Kayode D. '27,"November 12, 2024","I wrote in an earlier blog that I took up running. Since coming back to MIT, I am sad to report that the habit has ceased and I no longer run everyday.!#@p!#@I realized recently that I lack discipline. I’ve been burnt by the burn-out of too much work to do and I steer clear at the first sign of stress or discomfort. This usually looks like me spending too much time on youtube or (if i’m feeling particularly productive) a descent in wikipedia rabbitholes [three cool rabbitholes i found: marathons  and judo, football, and board games].!#@p!#@My friend, Bry⁠01 , recently told me she bought tickets to run in the Cambridge Half Marathon, but was no longer able to run it, so she wanted to sell the tickets. This seemed like a great way to build disciple! The race was a month out, which gave me just enough time to train, I thought. If I really buckled down it would be hard, but I’d be able to do it.!#@p!#@So did I look up training plans or strategies on how to get my distance up? Nope. I went for a 5 mile run to test out the waters:!#@p!#@My big plan was to go running with other runners who knew tips and how to conserve energy. My technique is bad and I tend to burn out wayyy too fast. If I start to feel tired I speed up so I can get to “that tree up there” which becomes “that intersection” and then “that building” and I keep pushing back my finish line in an attempt to build a stronger character or something. I just care about my character development too much, ya know?!#@p!#@Anyways, the run is simple: run through BU, run through Newbury Street (or rather, the street parallel to it b/c i would get distracted by newbury comics⁠02 ), and then back up by chipotle to get to Simmons. ~5 miles.!#@p!#@Everything started out good. I left Sunday night at like 6:30 when the sun was still out but starting to set, and really enjoyed the run. So much so that I missed my turn. By a lot. I kept thinking i could get back on track if I just stayed on the path I was going, and I was having so much fun! I was going to run a HALF MARATHON!! I live in BOSTON!! This is so freaking cool!!!#@p!#@And by the time I finally stopped to figure out where I was I realized something. I was now equidistant from MIT… and the Airport. I should probably head back, but how FUNNY would it be if I ran to the airport? I could run there, take a funny picture like “how did I get here?” and then take the train back to MIT. So I look at it on google maps real quick [FORESHADOWING] to make sure it was possible, and keep running. I ran though the downtown part of Boston, through the footpaths and plazas. I saw a concert happening and tons of shops and restaurants. It truly was a grand old time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1088-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1089-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1090-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1093-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1104-800x1067.jpg]!#@Then I got to the docks.!#@p!#@And realized that there’s no bridge.!#@p!#@There isn’t a bridge from the mainland to the island that Boston Logan Airport is on. The line on Google Maps was a ferry it wanted me to take. But take a boat just to take a train back? I might as well just run home and keep running! So that’s what I did. Until I looked at my map again:!#@p!#@NOW, I was equidistant from MIT and the airport if i ran around the LONG way. And so I did. Because I had runners high and I’m an idiot.!#@p!#@Eventually I get a call from my friend, Sydney (MA Resident), who asks when I’ll be back at Simmons. Unbeknownst to her, I was on the journey of a lifetime, to THE Boston Logan International Airport…on foot. I told her what I was up to, and she showed concern. Like a lot of concern. It was dark and night. But I was FINE, I told her. I was almost to the bridge, and then it’s a clear shot to the airport train station.!#@p!#@And as I’m on the phone with her I reach the bridge and realize…it’s a tunnel. A tunnel for cars.!#@p!#@But now I’ve gone too deep. I have to get to the airport now. I don’t want to give up. I have a fire in my blood and by golly I’m going to see that sweet sweet tarmac if it’s the last thing I do. So I recalculate and plan to run across…the next bridge. Or maybe the next one? I share my location with Sydney and get to running.!#@p!#@This is where it stopped being fun. I wasn’t in the populated plazas anymore, I was just on some street. Like it was still a well lit street, but it wasn’t really enjoyable anymore. I was just running now because I had to, not because I wanted to. Eventually I get a call from my roommate, Noah (another Bostonian). Sydney has told him my Great Plan, and he was not an enthused as I had hoped.!#@p!#@“Kayode, you can’t run to the airport. The city is literally designed that way,” he said.!#@p!#@“Keep the SAME ENERGY when it happens,” I told him confidently. “There’s a bridge on the north end, I can make it.”!#@p!#@“Just come home, we’re already proud of you, you ran like 6 miles, just come home.”!#@p!#@“Ok, but how much more proud will you be when I run all the way to the airport?”!#@p!#@“Honestly, I’ll think you’re an even bigger idiot if you keep running. It won’t make me any more proud of you.”!#@p!#@And then I had to stop. What was I doing? Why was I so determined to run to the airport? Through an unknown area in an unknown city at NIGHT. Suddenly the reality of the danger I was about to put myself through sank in. It would be more than an hour until I reached the airport. I needed to go home.!#@p!#@And so go home I did. I ran to the Orange Line and road the train back to MIT. I have not run since.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1096-800x1731.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-12-153635-800x424.png]!#@…!#@p!#@I shared this story in a blogger meeting, to which Petey (Resident Bostonian) showed immediate and intense concern with me going through that area of Boston. He wanted to be very clear that I should NOT run across the Chelsea Bridge at night, ever. It’s the site of some real bad things that have happened, and wouldn’t be a fun time.!#@p!#@So now I have shared this cautionary tale with all of you.!#@p!#@Moral of the story: Don’t try to run to the airport, or to any unknown location, much less at night.!#@p!#@map of good places to run!#@p!#@There are lots of great, safe places to run in Boston, and until I started to leave those areas I was having tons of fun!! Hopefully I can get back into it when it gets warmer but for now, I’ll stick to staying indoors and psetting⁠03 😭😭😭.!#@p!#@Note from while editing: I started running again. I think i just got spooked out of it. Editing this reminded me of a passage of scripture that I just went to re-read (1 Corinthians 9: 24-27). It’s in part of a letter from the apostle Paul to the Church of Corinth, and he talks about running races and running in a way is if to win, but ALSO not running like a man running aimlessly (me) or fighting like a man beating the air, but to do it so as to work towards winning the spiritual race. I need to run as if to win this spiritual / literal race. Maybe I’ll try for the Charlie Card Challenge?!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1088-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1089-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1090-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1093-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1104-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1096-800x1731.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-12-153635-800x424.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-tried-to-run-to-the-airport/
If I ever come back by CJ Q. '23,on being away from mit,by CJ Q. '23,"November 12, 2024","Cross-posted from my blog, which is where I write these days.!#@p!#@At the beginning of senior year, I began tackling the question on my final final exam: What happens next?!#@p!#@Decision-making is a skill. Like many skills, there’s a body of knowledge, scattered in decision theory textbooks, rationality blog posts, and sappy screeds about choosing where to go to college. Like many skills, there’s a gap between knowing and working, a gap exacerbated by the fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding big choices. Unlike many skills, there’s not opportunities to practice, as the life decisions are distant, and the feedback cycles are lengthy. Many scenarios are similar, but none are the same; the contexts are simply too different.!#@p!#@All this to say: for me, choosing what to do after college was easier than choosing where to go for college. But only a little easier.!#@p!#@Let’s simplify this decision. Should I do an MEng or not? Should I spend another year or two in MIT and get another degree, or should I leave Boston and work in industry? Never mind the question of what industry I’ll work in; this decision alone was already plenty difficult.!#@p!#@To theory, then. In software engineering, we have a whole toolkit to make changes with confidence. Regression tests prevent you from repeating past mistakes. Feature gates let you quickly switch between code paths. Database backups help you recover after a bad migration. Confidence comes when you’re certain that your changes are correct, and it comes when you have easy ways to revert issues.!#@p!#@Can I run regression tests? No, the previous contexts are too different to make useful generalizations from. Can I add feature gates? That would mean living two lives in parallel, and only making a decision after seeing the results. Can I make backups? Maybe if I could immerse MIT in stasis, leave, and hope it’s exactly the same when I come back. So much for theory, then.!#@p!#@Stay with MIT, or leave MIT. Choose one, knowing that the action of choosing will change me in an unpredictable way. If I stay, will you go? And if I go, will you stay?!#@p!#@Let me explain myself: I chose MIT because it was what I needed.!#@p!#@It’s a bit transactional to put it that way, but it’s true. I needed a degree, an education, and a ticket to raise my status. I needed a community, or two, or three; I needed places and people I could call home. I needed to learn the feeling of fitting in somewhere long-term; I needed stability. I needed to get my heart broken in new ways. I didn’t know I needed these things, but I got them, and MIT was instrumental in filling these holes.!#@p!#@Let me explain myself: I left MIT because it isn’t what I need.!#@p!#@I don’t think I’ve gotten everything I could out of MIT; that’d take many lifetimes. Rather, I was running into diminishing returns, partly due to learning less, partly due to feeling less. Toward the end of my undergrad, I often felt unmoored from my activities. Sure, I’d already decided that I wasn’t doing an MEng, but I think I would’ve felt the same no matter what. I needed a change, and staying with MIT, even staying in Boston, wouldn’t give me enough of it, even accounting for how MIT will change.!#@p!#@Then again: did I leave MIT because it will be better for me? Am I ignoring why I chose MIT long ago? No. The lesson from that choice was to think about what matters to me, and to trust my own assessment for what matters, even if it doesn’t line up with what others think. The decisions never lay with others, they lay with me.!#@p!#@What matters to me, then? I was stuck on this years ago, but I have a better idea now. While I haven’t had this exact decision before, I can test my thoughts against similar experiences, so I can avoid repeating past mistakes. From doing a UROP, I learned how important internal motivation was. From doing an internship, I learned how important becoming a better programmer was.!#@p!#@Now a pessimistic brain might be thinking: Of course these things are important. That’s like saying you value excellence, or respect, or community. And that’d be right. Without explanation, a value is contentless. No, the value of a value lies in its trade-offs. The value of a value lies in how it guides decision-making.!#@p!#@Valuing internal motivation means saying no to projects I’m not excited about, even if I have other good reasons to work on them. It means that if I run out of internal motivation, I need to spend time finding it, else, I quit. Valuing becoming better means saying yes to projects at the edge of my skills, even if it opens the possibility of failing. It means keeping a project I’m struggling with if I’m learning, even if it means missing a deadline or sacrificing quality.!#@p!#@Since graduation, I’ve come back to Boston five times, but it was only the latest visit that prompted me to write this post, as it was only in the latest visit that I was possessed by the strangest feeling, when I stepped onto campus from the Kendall/MIT station, an unbearable lightness lifting the hairs of my back, intensifying the more I walked, and it was then when I realized I’ve felt this before:!#@p!#@A stairstep that exists in the mind but not in the world: that image made sense. Walking through MIT felt like walking through two worlds at once. The Green Building is in permanent construction, a dorm room in East Campus never gathers dust, the Stud stays drab and dim. Looking at these places, these places splitting at the seams with incongruence, filled me with—something. The postlude to the lightness. It wasn’t sadness. It wasn’t grief, because I know what grief feels like:!#@p!#@No, the feeling was quieter than that. Not as pointed, but still uncomfortable. Mildly painful, but a pain I could live with. There’s no longing attached to it, other than the want to stop feeling it.!#@p!#@The other day I started watching Log Log Land, and I was once again overtaken by this feeling; the first five minutes were fine, but then the setting started switching from one dorm room to another, each filled with people, studying or talking or hanging out, and it was then that the feeling became so strong I had to stop watching and collect myself.!#@p!#@And no, the feeling wasn’t negative. There was a small note of vicarious pride. Contentment in seeing others live in places I’ve loved. All that, undercut by diluted envy. The thought wouldn’t it be nice, so weak it was silent:!#@p!#@Wouldn’t it be nice, being a student again?!#@p!#@It would. But that’s not my life to live anymore.!#@p!#@Wouldn’t it be nice, having dozens of friends a few doors down the hall?!#@p!#@It would. But that’s not what I’m going to get.!#@p!#@Wouldn’t it be nice, living in Boston, visiting MIT often?!#@p!#@It would. But that’s not the same. It wouldn’t satisfy me.!#@p!#@And how would I know, if I don’t experience it?!#@p!#@I don’t. I don’t know. It’s not like I can live two lives in parallel,!#@p!#@and only make the decision after seeing the result?!#@p!#@That ball of feelings, tangled up like yarn, that mild pain, that small vicarious pride, that little contentment, that diluted envy; all of these pointed to the passage of time, the cycle of growing up and leaving, the awareness that others will grow up and leave; all of these added up to a sensitivity to ephemerality, to transience, to next time, next time.!#@p!#@Something like mono no aware, perhaps.!#@p!#@That visit, when I ate with friends, I avoided eating on campus. That visit, when I worked, I went to coffee shops, not the libraries. That visit was shorter than my previous four visits, and part of me wished it was even shorter.!#@p!#@It hurt, being in MIT, without being of MIT.!#@p!#@Who’s singing to whom here?!#@p!#@From MIT’s perspective, I didn’t leave it, it left me. It’s always moving with the merciless speed of institutional change. It would take all my speed to keep up with it, and by then I wouldn’t have enough to go elsewhere.!#@p!#@Movement is always relative. There are no stillnesses: you’re always moving with respect to something. Even if you’re stuck somewhere, you’re moving with that place, and if that place is stuck somewhere, it’s moving with the earth. (Why would you ever want to move faster? Is hurtling around the sun not enough of a miracle for you?)!#@p!#@Long before we learn this principle of relativity, we learn counterfactual thinking, we learn decentration, we learn perspective-taking, we learn a theory of mind, we learn object permanence. These are cognitive capacities about things outside ourselves, because, apparently, growing up is about destroying egocentricity.!#@p!#@Is it fair, then, for me to whine about my pain of being apart from MIT, when MIT could be in as much pain being apart from me? I know, it’s ridiculous, thinking of places as having emotions. But it’s not like MIT is immersed in stasis when I’m not there. It’s not frozen like a photograph. It continues moving, flowing, pulsing, breathing.!#@p!#@Imagine seeing thousands of people come and leave every semester, like leaves that grow and fall every season. Would it not break you? Or would you get used to it?!#@p!#@My memory of graduation is, I’m certain, false. It’s silent but for the reading of names and the intermittent applause. I remember lining up to get onto the stage, walking down after getting my diploma, and a smash cut between. A subtle act, graduating. Ostensibly, it happens in the moment you’re declared a graduate. But if, after you graduate, you’re no longer an undergrad—then graduation has to be a much, much longer process.!#@p!#@Everything they say about distance and hearts and fondness is trash. The time I’ve spent apart only makes it easier to move on. The want to have fulfilling work, the want to be around good friends, the want to create beautiful things, these are holes MIT used to fill. Now, I have to put in more work to fill these holes, because there’s no longer a single thing that ticks all the boxes.!#@p!#@And I knew, I knew couldn’t keep relying on MIT to fill these holes. Because MIT (the place, and the things, and the people associated) and I are moving in different directions. Because using MIT (the place, the things, and the people) to fill that hole brings some contentment, but also, some pain.!#@p!#@Because, above all, I don’t want to be the person who overstays their welcome. I don’t want to be the person who can’t live in the present. I don’t want to be the person who thinks the best days of their life are behind them. I don’t want to be the person who, years after graduating, holds on to the places, things, and people from their undergraduate years.!#@p!#@Because, after all, I’ve graduated. That means I can’t be an undergrad any more. And it’s easier to throw something away wholesale, than it is to only throw away the parts you don’t want anymore. And the only way I can get rid of this nagging pain and these cloying wants is to leave it all behind.!#@p!#@Right?!#@p!#@No, the answer isn’t to leave everything behind, because starting fresh doesn’t have to mean starting over. I don’t have to be within MIT for MIT to be within me.!#@p!#@No, the answer isn’t to get rid of the pain. Didn’t I say earlier that the feeling isn’t all negative?

Nostalgia is a positive emotional experience, one of those rare cognitive psychology findings that replicates.!#@p!#@No, the answer isn’t to deny MIT. The answer can’t be to deny MIT. It was a huge part of my life. It’s four whole years! There’s no reason it can’t still be a part. A smaller part, maybe, but a part nonetheless. I can’t leave behind the tens of classes I’ve taken, the hundreds of friends I’ve made, the thousands of lines of code I’ve written, the tens of thousands of hours I’ve spent on campus, the hundreds of thousands of words I’ve written for the admissions blogs, the millions of things I’ve loved and hated again and again, and the innumerable measure I’ve gained besides.!#@p!#@At last, the song drops the title.!#@p!#@In my last visit, I went to Tech Squares, and it was the first night of that semester’s PE class.

I walked across the Harvard Bridge. I found myself thinking about what Ted said. I’ve probably left lots of DNA in MIT, through fallen hair or dead skin. I’ve left many other things too. Stuffed toys I’ve given away, signatures I’ve written in yearbooks, knick-knacks I’ve donated to floor lounges. Class projects I’ve created. Student groups I’ve poured hours of my life into. Friends I’ve made, even when I knew our time was bounded.!#@p!#@Many of these things will disappear.

[joint post] blogston commons by Janet G. '27,"with Allison E. ‘27, Ellie F. ‘28, Jebby ‘25, and Sara N. ‘28",by Janet G. '27,"November 11, 2024","creds to Allison for the post title <3!#@p!#@welcome to today’s episode of m*thbusters!⁠01 today, we’re clearing out some classic misconceptions that you may hold about Bloggers, Boston, and the Great Beyond.!#@p!#@claim: mit students grind all day and do nothing but studying!#@p!#@fact: we work hard, but we do a lot of other things too! eating, crying over problem sets, and idk like the 200+ clubs that exist at mit need to have people running them or something!#@p!#@claim: boston weather sucks!#@p!#@fact: well, only a little bit if you’re not used to not seeing the sun every day (yes looking at you tropical climate enjoyers). there are also very lovely clear days with 70 degrees⁠02 weather, as you will soon see :)!#@p!#@claim: the bloggers are a collective hivemind who hang out every week and all live together and are besties ⁠03!#@p!#@fact: so like, technically not true. we have a surprising number of blogger roommates⁠04 which is very cool, but many of us only see the others at blogger meetings and occasionally wave hi in the corridors.!#@p!#@however, this does not stop us from trying to make the claim into a fact. Angie F. ‘28, Ellie F. ‘28 and i were talking the other day about how the bloggers are actually really cool and based and it was kinda sad how we didn’t really all know each other that well. therefore, because we are energetic independent college students who tAke AgEnCy with our lives, we decided to organise a blogger hangout! and this is the point when we cut off our short-lived episode of m*thbusters and bust out the party music because WELCOME TO BLOGSTON COMMONS EP. 1 EVERYONE!!! 🎉🎉🎉!#@p!#@it began, as many MIT things do, with a when2meet.!#@p!#@in true mit fashion, this attempt turns out to become 13 people filling out the when2meet, a slot that only 11 people⁠05 said they could tentatively make, and ended up with 5 people who actually met up at Kendall square to do our scheduled hangout idea. honestly this is probably a record retention rate already!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image2-1-400x300.png]!#@organising hangouts is hard. finding an activity to do is also hard. thankfully, we share the common theme of being bloggers who have experience with yapping about random stuff, so after some consideration we decided to do a little race where we will blog all the way to boston commons ⁠06 and back, and call it a day. the day was crisp, the skies were clear, and the bloggers were BLOGGING!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1-1-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image10-1-800x972.png]!#@i had planned out a google doc of logistics the day before. due to A Series of Unfortunate Events ⁠07 we had to uphaul most of the logistics and play it by ear. what we did have were some random ideas that i threw down as random blog prompts the day before, so we took these ideas and kinda ran (or trained???) with them.!#@p!#@boston commons came much earlier than expected, so we rushed out of the traincar at the last moment like manic wolves. we found a nice bench with a bunch of squirrels nearby that kept on distracting us,⁠08 but were successfully able to lock in on the park bench and slam out our blogs.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image12-1-400x300.png]!#@jebby was the first to finish. actually, she was so based she finished a prelim version about 5 minutes after getting off the train (which was maybe like 15 minutes total??), but it was so wrought with shaky train-based typos that she had to fix* those before the post was fit for publishing. (*read annotation please)⁠09 fortunately, she had a slam-dunk margin on the rest of us so she decided to spend most of her victory lap drawing sad faces on MS paint (which you can marvel at in her blog).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image3-1-400x534.png]!#@i finished second; i think once i took my blog a lot less seriously i was able to churn out words at the same pace at which i used to bs in debate speeches and essays about roman mythologies. is it quality? like, no, absolutely not. was it quantity? yes, enough for me to get second place. i also had to do a lot of revising after my first round of word vomit though. i spent the rest of the time marvelling at the squirrels on the street.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image11-1-800x993.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image7-1.png]!#@ellie was a very close third. aside from the squirrel distractions i think she was very consistent in the pace at which she was writing. i think this also shows in the impressive cohesion of her blog when compared to mine and jebby’s, so i think she wins on combined quality and speed ☠️!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image5-1-400x534.png]!#@after this point all of us were getting a little cold because apparently the sunny day could not compensate for the wind chills. i decided to take us to bakey, a really cute bakery that’s super close to commons! people have apparently not been there so i got us a yummy strawberry broissant and cinnamon babka. delicious, especially when piping hot on a wintery day.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image4-1-e1731301329905-800x547.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image13-1-800x600.png]!#@we continued editing blogs and frantically writing them, but eventually ellie and sara had to dip to other commitments, and then jebby also had to leave to, and i approximately quote, “take a nap because [she] haven’t slept since yesterday oops.”⁠10 (*also corrected in annotation) sara and allison fully finished their blogs later (on a timer still for the sake of the game :P), but at this point we were ready to go.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image15-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image8-1-800x1067.png]!#@allison and i were both planning on getting friends flowers for the concert choir performance that we were going to watch that night, so we walked to the trader joes in boylston and bought flowers + misc other groceries. we then walked all the way back to mit because it was a jobless saturday afternoon for the both of us and we wanted to enjoy the view. boston was glowing that day :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image6-1-400x534.png]!#@of course, this is only primarily my side of the story, so we shall let the writers speak for themselves about what they thought about blogston commons. without further ado, i welcome our blogston commons participants to give their own thoughts and reflection on their blogs!!#@p!#@To be clear, I was completely sober while I was writing. All I cared about was being the fastest person to write a blog post, not a good blog post.!#@p!#@I chose the prompt “Write about a useless fact” for two reasons:!#@p!#@I already had MS Word pulled up on my laptop. The second we started, I just pulled out any unfiltered thought and blasted them all over the page. I was quite successful, being the first person to hit 500 words.!#@p!#@But, winning came with a cost. I have autocorrect turned off, and my accuracy drops significantly when I type too fast, which really shows in the final product. For the last several hours, I’ve had to carry the burden of first-hand embarrassment that comes with committing to the bit too hard. I bet there was a high schooler out there who was scrolling eagerly through the MIT blogs, only to see my post-modernist Ulysses-esque rambling about Boston history, and quietly decided never to step foot on MIT’s campus.!#@p!#@This is what a winner looks like, whether you like it or not.!#@p!#@idk i feel like i’ve said enough on this post LOL in all honesty i was not prepared to choose a topic at all so after i said i would do dinner conversations i regretted my decision for a solid 15 mins because i was like uhhh i literally don’t remember what i ate for dinner. it’s okay though i scrolled through my calendar and recollected the events so now you get to see three days of my unfiltered interesting food consumption habits??? enjoy??? at least it was candid. i also wanted to do this speed blog challenge to help me take blogging less seriously and i think mission accomplished on that front so i’m pretty happy about that. also HANGING WITH THE BLOGGERS WAS SUPER CUTIES and everyone was so fun to hang out with so we must do this more… it will happen trust!#@p!#@I thought writing about the T was very thematic lol. As I said in my blog, I really love public transport and just being able to go places. Also on another note the bloggers are the coolest people in the world (and MIT) so I was really happy to get to spend time with y’all, doing cursed things on the T and saying cursed thing in the commons and eating really yummy babka. I also loved the freedom of just writing without thinking too much about all the word choice and phrasing – its like drawing in MS paint,⁠11 where you can’t be perfect, you just want to get the ideas and content down. the silly contest/time limit thing also helped me just word vomit on the page, in a way. overall I really loved it and I hope we can do smth similar soon >:) redline challenge when???!#@p!#@Writing quickly is… not my strong suit, so I needed a prompt that was relatively simple (clear plot line, nuclear, minimal introspection, etc.). Pumpkins fit the bill, and for once I am not several months too late for posting something [specific time period]-themed! Writing with other people was also super fun. Plus getting out and seeing Boston!!  Yay Blogston Commons :D!#@p!#@Just going in, I knew this challenge would be a struggle for me – I tend to get stuck on details. For context, it took me around ~10 hours to write my first blog post, not counting the nearly two weeks of ideation & six handwritten pages of outlining that came before. I spent hours playing around with sentence structure and the ordering of paragraphs and each individual word choice. It was a process that I loved, but also one that I realize often gets in my way while I’m actually writing. One of the best pieces of writing advice I’ve ever gotten – from an English professor I had in high school! – is to learn to detangle the creator and critic inside me, to learn to let the critic rest so that the creator can… create. That’s something I’m working on, and this fun, little challenge felt like the perfect way to practice getting out of my head while writing.!#@p!#@I tend to use writing as a medium of introspection, kind of like a fluid and confessional way to explore the big ideas I have floating within me and to consolidate them into something more cohesive. Taking my subject matter less seriously for a change helped me think about my life in new ways, though. My prompt was to write about my favorite eating utensil, but since our blogs had to relate to our given prompts only tangentially, I chose forks as my starting point and let my mind wander. Putting together the story I tell in this latest blog helped me notice some of the finer details of my life. I’m the girl who loves instant noodles, the girl who still has to look up whether something is microwave-safe every single time, the girl who calls her mom at 1am on the regular. In a way, these small details are more meaningful and more telling of who I am then all the big philosophies I can compose in my head. And I’m a rambler at my core, so it felt good to just let all that out while writing rather than trying to be economical with my words.!#@p!#@I’ve still got a long way to go with writing under a time limit – if Jebby can be declared the absolute winner of our little challenge, then, as the last person to finish, I guess that makes me the absolute loser. It took me over an hour to write my first eleven words, but then I wrote the remaining eight hundred under a twenty-minute timer, so I think I’m making progress. And I loved, loved, loved spending time with the other bloggers. I say this all the time to the people in my life, but I am truly in awe of the other bloggers, who are some of the most fun, interesting, and creative people I know. I love spending time with them and getting inspired and soaking up their genius via osmosis. Counting down the days till the #RedLineChallenge 🤤 ⁠12!#@p!#@thanks for coming to our little adventure episode <3 see you next time!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image2-1-400x300.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1-1-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image10-1-800x972.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image12-1-400x300.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image3-1-400x534.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image11-1-800x993.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image7-1.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image5-1-400x534.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image4-1-e1731301329905-800x547.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image13-1-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image15-1-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image8-1-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image6-1-400x534.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blogston-commons/
someday by Kai V. '25,fate of friends,by Kai V. '25,"November 10, 2024","This summer, my friends in LA kept telling me I hadn’t changed at all since high school. I expected to feel annoyed: in an objective sense, I’m a lot better adjusted now than I was in high school, and I might have wanted this to be recognized. Instead I just felt relieved that there was some core part of myself they could still easily reach out and touch, unaltered by three years of transcontinental distance.!#@p!#@It was my first time really hanging out with them in about three years: my family moved out of LA when the pandemic started, so I had barely been back since then. Actually it was wonderful to see how many things had stayed the same, little things I’d forgotten and felt a warm surge of familiarity upon recognizing. Los Angeles is filled with murals sprawling over twenty-story-tall brick buildings and stout concrete drugstore walls alike. Saints, women, flowers, eyes, music, all awash in rainbow. All of us sweating under one sun. Whenever I saw a mural I’d passed by a million times back then, I felt a jolt of sweet memory. There were new murals, too, blooms and shoots where the city had grown since my last visit. Coming back together, we both had something new to give.!#@p!#@My friends owned cars and had deeper voices. They all looked thicker, sturdier. I thought I did too: finally over the past year I’d achieved a consistent workout routine and diet that lent some volume to my upper body. “There’s something weirdly satisfying about Kai being athletic now,” S said. I thrilled at the idea of one of my old friends, who’d known me back when I failed each and every single one of the state fitness tests (underweight; zero push-ups; zero squats; zero sit-ups), calling me athletic. I was surprised, too, that S and I could now joke about our coursework with each other, when our high school interests had been so disparate. We’d both taken the long way around to computer science at our respective colleges.!#@p!#@We swam at the beach and went to J’s place afterwards. During the early pandemic I had lived with J’s family for a few months. Since then they had renovated their kitchen and bathroom and adopted a dog, and his sister was about two feet taller. But the house smelled just the same as it had when I stayed there. Actually I was struck by how immediate it was—crossing the threshold, I mean, of the door to his house, and how rapidly it transported me to that period four years ago when on weeknights I would make a lava cake and he would pull up Attack on Titan and we would watch and do our calculus homework and talk about life.!#@p!#@We played Terraforming Mars in the garage until J had to catch his flight. Then A drove me back to his house to spend the night. It was early morning—something like 4 a.m.—when we shuffled sleepily from his car to his apartment, enveloped in gentle southern Californian warmth. He had moved since high school to a new place that smelled different. (I knew the smell of his old place very well: we were often build partners for Science Olympiad, so I was in his garage all the time, arguing about designs and rationing our remaining solder, always in a delirium of sleep deprivation and cold in the nights before competition. After competitions we mostly played Black Ops 2 in his living room and blew up MOSFETs.)!#@p!#@In the morning when his mom saw me she began reminiscing on my and A’s high school days. “Do you remember when I would take you guys to UCLA for chemistry lectures?” I did—and remembered her buying us tamales on the way there every month for two years, always trying to convince me of the merits of eating meat after I went vegetarian but switching to buying me tamales filled with chili and cheese instead of pork anyway. “Do you still have your Spanish?” I didn’t; I had spoken maybe three full sentences in Spanish since graduation.!#@p!#@She put hot chocolate on the stove and began making a tall stack of toast with butter for me and the rest of her children. A’s little brother, who had barely been able to say a complete sentence the last time I saw him, was now explaining his Pokemon collection to me. Finally just before I left, his mom gave me a hug: “You’re mostly the same as you were in high school. You’re less shy, though, no?”!#@p!#@Maybe it speaks to the morbid weirdo I was as a child, but I’ve never related to the saying “you don’t know what you have until you lose it.” During recess I hovered at some removed vantage point, sometimes on the swings or else behind some bushes or under the low canopy of a tree, where I could see everyone else but no one would notice me, and narrated the scene in my head. Many times I thought, life will only get worse from here, so I should always appreciate the moment. I have no idea why I was this down on life when I was, like, ten years old. But in any case, I was always soaking in nostalgia for the present. Dreading the decay that would come with time passing.!#@p!#@Only recently have I felt that, although the moment is worth giving yourself over to, so is the passage of time. I live at pika now, an ILG⁠01 at MIT. A few weeks ago a small contingent went apple picking at an orchard and brought back bags and bags of the crispest, sweetest apples I had ever eaten. By chance three pika alumni were visiting that week; one of them works at a cider brewery. So the following Friday night I walked into the CGE⁠02 and found people squeezing the liquid from apple pulp into a funnel while alumni gathered, reminiscing over their days at pika: Wow, I remember this. But so much has changed.!#@p!#@When I come home, someone’s cooking dinner for the house, playing Charli xcx over the speakers; each painting hanging on the wall of the staircase up to my room is one I recognize every stroke of. Now after I’m away for a week, when I step over the threshold to the foyer once again, the smell of the house hits me all at once and I remember what to expect: my roommate’s jacket draped over his swivel chair, one housemate’s piano notes floating up the stairwell, another’s distinctive whistling through the window.!#@p!#@All around pika hang reminders of past lives: the murals washing over walls, a poem written in sharpie next to the bathroom mirror, another printed out and taped between the ceiling and the doorframe. I’ve never considered myself big on poetry, but this autumn is convincing me otherwise. It turns out I love poetry when I know it meant something to someone, when it’s not just an abstract stream of verse that I feel pressured to “get”, when instead it’s a diaphanous hand reaching through space and time to show me a slice of its world. I like the poetry plastered around pika because it shows the love people had for their housemates then, and how similar it is to the love I have now.!#@p!#@Love is closing my eyes just to forget if each breath of air is mine or yours. Love is a deal, you sit on the couch scraping a spoon around your bowl and I lie in bed falling asleep to the sound of someone else choosing to crumble to entropy in the same space as me. Sitting in the murph⁠03 together, you’re plucking at your bass, I’m palming a glass of juice I won’t finish. At the end of the night I’m thinking—when someone asks me, as a joke, what I’d do if I dropped out of school now—the answer is to be with my friends, to sit together leaning softly on each other’s tired bodies, to keep crystallizing a core I’ll hold on to forever, so that in four years I will reach out and find the same person you are now, a little older and wiser and sturdier but you just the same.!#@p!#@To ask where you are and feel happy when you say you’re enjoying your date. To be under your silk touch light eyes struck like a guitar string by your voice. To feel sorry when I say the wrong thing; to feel the opening of a waterfall when I make you laugh. To laugh and laugh and laugh and to know that makes nothing between us less valuable. To be there someday in your living room while your mom puts hot chocolate on the stove for me. For some time I had forgotten the simple, warm glow of friendship; now it wells over everything else.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/someday/
24 Pumpkins by Allison E. '27,a journey through the streets of Boston,by Allison E. '27,"November 9, 2024","As a person who hails from a land devoid of seasons, I consider it my utmost duty to take advantage of any fall-related activities that come my way. Amongst other things, I’ve been taking pictures of the changing leaves (for some reason, the trees on campus are sad and brown, while the trees along Charles River are gloriously red), jumping into random piles of leaves (shoutout to the folks who are making these), and trying a variety of fall-themed Trader Joe’s snacks (the maple syrup fudge is absolutely horrendous).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241103_144634-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241103_144813-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241025_082721-800x600.jpg]!#@But those are all the small, trifling acts of an amateur fall enthusiast. The true spirit of college fall can only be captured in something far sillier. Today, I present to you: Operation Pumpkin.!#@p!#@Objective: Transport 24 large, carving-size pumpkins 1.5 miles across the Harvard Bridge!#@p!#@Client: The International Student Association, for its Inter-College Halloween Board Game Party!#@p!#@Target: Star Market – 53 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02199!#@p!#@Operatives: Miranda Z. ‘27, Evelyn L. ‘27, Csilla F. ‘27, Allison E. ‘27!#@p!#@Equipment: 2 carts borrowed from dorms and an indominable spirit!#@p!#@Timeline: Complete by 2000!#@p!#@The mission was scheduled to begin at 1800, with a tight turnaround to meet the timeline. We quickly encountered delays, however, and by the time that two dorm carts were acquired, it was 1830. The clock was ticking. We sped across the bridge with our carts, moving carefully so as to avoid assaulting nearby pedestrians.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241025_183657-1000x750.jpg]!#@We encountered our first obstacle upon reaching Boston. Notably, it was a Friday night, which meant that the streets were filled with people for whom we immediately became a public nuisance (sincere apologies, y’all 😔). Luckily, we made it through the crowded sections without doing bodily harm to any bystanders (or ourselves), and soon arrived at Star Market.!#@p!#@Our late start meant that we only had 45 minutes left, but fortuitously, it also allowed us to rendezvous with an additional operative. Now armed with 33% more labor, we descended upon Star Market. We had called ahead to ensure that there were enough pumpkins to satisfy our objective, and we were not disappointed by their stock. It took a surprisingly long time to actually pick out and load 24 pumpkins into the carts, and an additional grocery-shopping side quest waylaid us further. Nevertheless, we persevered.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241025_193128-1000x750.jpg]!#@And then began the true challenge–transporting more than 300 lbs of pumpkin 1.5 miles back across the bridge to our dorm. With two people to each cart, weaving in and out of people and construction zones, we began our journey back. We pushed through the weird stares, took heart from the confused smiles, and “sorry”’d our way through the streets of Boston. On several occasions, our carts almost rolled straight into the street–for some reason, the sidewalks are all slanted into the road, so we had to have one person pushing from behind, and one person standing on the side to keep it from sliding into oncoming traffic.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241025_203105-scaled-e1731197772423-1000x740.jpg]!#@Fortunately, we reached the Harvard Bridge with our pumpkins (and nearby pedestrians) unscathed, and from there it was a straight shot back. We were running behind schedule, but nonetheless–24 pumpkins were successfully transported home.

Ellie on the M.T.A. by Ellie F. '28,"writing about the T, on the T",by Ellie F. '28,"November 9, 2024","I grew up without any public transportation. The closest thing we had in Arkansas was an old-fashioned tram system in Little Rock, and a single bus route that I don’t believe really existed. But when my family traveled to Chengdu, China, and eventually more and more cities, I got to see how convenient a subway system could be. Also, I hate driving, so public transportation has that going for it too.!#@p!#@The first time I visited Boston, in my junior year of high school, I fell in love with the T. It’s not the best subway system in the world, of course, but I remember riding the Red Line and passing Charles/MGH, watching the MIT sailboats glide on the shimmering water. I remember ringing the chimes at Kendall/MIT and wondering about the minimum number of T stops you’d need to pass in order to go to every stop on the T without leaving.!#@p!#@The T is central to the college experience I’ve had and want to have. I transferred to the Orange Line to eat at Chinatown with my SSP friends. I went up to Harvard Station when my cousins visited, and Central when my friends and I got tickets to an EDM rave (it was really loud). On the last day of Orientation, all of the first-year class went to the aquarium. On our way back, past midnight, we skipped down the streets to the station, admiring the way light reflected off the faces of all the buildings in the dim light. When I felt down, I rode the Red Line across the river and walked up the narrow streets to buy a succulent from a tiny flowershop bursting with greenery.!#@p!#@As for buses: I’ve had some, well, interesting experiences. I once asked my Bostonian friend how the buses worked here. He said that they didn’t. I managed anyways, somehow. I’ve talked to a woman crocheting while waiting for the Harvard bus, and I’ve ignored a man telling the entire bus about his pencil drawing of Jesus. At CPW, I missed my stop and ended up in Harvard (the horror!) at 1 a.m. My roommate and I rode the bus to Symphony Hall, and we discretely listened to a college-aged guy use linear algebra terms to describe his life while my roommate repeatedly forgot to hold on to the dangling handles. We were a bit surprised when the guy didn’t get off at MIT.!#@p!#@I love living in a city, and I love being able to access so many amazing places. Now, I have another lovely experience to add to my bank of stories: writing together with these awesome bloggers. I started this blog squatting down, laptop on my knees, half-tilting into Jebby in a shakey Red Line compartment as Sara struggled to start a hotspot and Janet and Allison laughed and took pictures. At Park Street, I hurriedly gathered all my stuff, dropping my phone and water bottle in the process, and now, I’m sitting on a strangely long bench in Boston Commons, discussing squirrel sizes, and typing away on my computer. Here’s to four more years of adventures on the T! After all, it’s not about the destination—it’s about the journey (on the T) along the way.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ellie-on-the-m-t-a/

Absolutely nuts! It was somewhere in North End where in the 1900s or something⁠01 a giant tank of molasses exploded and flooded the streets of boston, and it straight up killed some people.⁠02 it was insane. I read a Harvard article⁠03 where some smart person figured out how fast the molasses were flowing, and apparently it was faster than Usain Bolt.⁠04 Scary!!!! And then the streets smelled like molasses for a littl ebit which was pleasant i guess. But you know whatisn’t pleasant? The molasses would be hot and runny qwhen it escaped the tank, butt hen when it flowed over the people onthe street on a cold January day in New England, it would move significantly slower and people got stuck and sucked into the molasses and it was liek sweet quicsand! mmmmm! but not mmm they died. DID I mention that they died?!#@p!#@Also fun fact about boston, there is the Freedom Trail, which I’ve wanted to wlak since frehsman year, but I would keep getting hosed :( but a few weeks agp, I wasn’t hosed and so I could walk the whole thing! I walked all the way from Park street to The battle of Bunker Hill.⁠05 I saw a bunch of historical places like the Samuel Adams statue and aslso the samuel adams brewery/bar⁠06 where theere were a bunch of miillennials having fun! I saw a bunch of cemeteries, which was realistically two or three.⁠07 I didn’t go to the granary burying ground because i’ve alreayd been there before. Anyway I saw this one grave that was next to a stump with these pretty mushrooms. I forgo tth eman⁠08 of the person who was buried there but it was dope. Then I got a bacon cheddar bagel sandwich somewhere. It was delicious, but there were too many poppy seeds on the bagel bun.!#@p!#@Anyway, I reached the USS Constitution, and I’ve already been to the museum exhibit but I did go into the gift shop to see if I wanted to buy anything. I didn’t buy anything. But I overheard a couple, where the guy was trying to persuade his girlfriend to let him buy ship-related souvenirs because his friend really liked ships. I think he was lying. Then, I reached the Bunker Hill Monument! On a whim, I stood in line for anyone who wanted to climb the monument. I hate stairs, but then I decided to do it because there was an eight-year-old or maybe a five-year-old boy who was waiting in front of me, so my adult ego got the best of me. I forgot how many steps it was— 269 steps?⁠09 Over 250 steps.⁠10 It was a struggle. I’m not that fit, so I had to take a rest every 50 steps. I was brathing so hard around the 200th step that i thought I was going to throw up. But I didn’t, and I reached the top! I took a picture of an overhead view of Charlestown and the North End. The trees were just turning red and orange, and it was gorgeous. Those were a lot of fun facts about Boston!

I think I am slowly going insane by Andi Q. '25,This is your brain on AI-generated videos,by Andi Q. '25,"November 6, 2024","Last week, Professor Han made an exciting announcement during 6.5940 (TinyML) lecture: the class was holding a competition, with AI development boards (worth $500+) as the top prizes! The competition involved watching hundreds of AI-generated videos and rating how realistic each looked. His lab was trying to create a benchmark for evaluating AI-generated videos, and outsourcing to MIT students was the best way to get the high-quality human-labeled data that OpenAI can only dream of.!#@p!#@The first-place prize was an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which Professor Han had demo-ed at the start of the semester running a ChatGPT-like application on a retro CRT-looking⁠01 display. It was so cute, and I really wanted to build one for myself, so I knew I had to compete.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-8.54.13 AM-400x255.png]!#@The dataset consisted of a few thousand videos generated by a handful of AI video models from prompts like “The archer launches the arrow towards the target” and “The robotic arm slides a towel across the table”.!#@p!#@“Wow, these videos… all look terrible” was my immediate reaction after watching and labeling a few of them. The AI models were bad – hilariously bad in many cases. I vividly remember watching one video generated from the prompt “Soccer players in purple celebrate as the crowd cheers” which just showed purple people-looking blobs jiggling on a blurry green background and one of them morphing into the soccer ball. It was nothing like the sleek videos OpenAI likes to tout in its demos.!#@p!#@(This is the kind of slop that these AI models would typically generate. To be fair, all the videos were generated for free, so I didn’t expect them to be that good in the first place.)!#@p!#@Yet one random Chinese AI model – “minimax” – was exceptionally good. Not only were its videos smooth and crisp, but they usually also followed the laws of physics. When I first saw a minimax video, I thought it was a real video mixed in as a sanity check for labelers.!#@p!#@(This video is taken from minimax’s website. I didn’t feel like sifting through the actual dataset for a minimax video, but most of them looked good like this.)!#@p!#@Two days and a few hundred videos in, I began picking up on some interesting trends. Each model would fail in predictable ways: OpenSora would always generate people as Lego mini-figures, CogVideoX would follow prompts very well but produce grainy/jittery videos, and minimax (my beloved) would simply not fail. (Each model (even the really awful ones) was also really good at generating videos of photorealistic feet for some reason⁠02 , which I found funny.)!#@p!#@Eventually, my brain just went on autopilot, labeling video after video for an hour. It was a good break from my usual MIT schoolwork, and it was somewhat entertaining seeing all the ways the AI models could hallucinate cars and people morphing into other things.!#@p!#@But that’s when everything started to go downhill.!#@p!#@It turns out (unsurprisingly) that minimax is not perfect. However, it only ever fails in extremely subtle ways, like a strand of hair experiencing a tad too much gravity or a tree branch swaying a tad too little in a gust of wind. Without me realizing it, these subtle flaws began to mess with my mind.!#@p!#@When I took a break from labeling videos to eat dinner in the dining hall, I caught myself staring at some ice cubes swirling around a friend’s drink.!#@p!#@“Hang on,” I thought, “is that how liquids should behave in real life? Those ice cubes seem to be moving around a little too fast.”!#@p!#@In fact, liquids do behave that way because I was experiencing real life and not some AI-generated pseudo-reality. Still, it was unnervingly disorienting to look at those ice cubes.!#@p!#@I still really wanted that NVIDIA board though, so I just shrugged it off as me being tired (it was a Thursday evening, after all), went to sleep, and continued labeling videos the next day. With each new video I labeled though, real life became ever so slightly less realistic. Human hair seemed to disobey the laws of gravity (somehow the videos had primed me to expect hair to act like it does in Pixar movies). Car tires seemed to rotate too quickly for the speed they were traveling at (that was another thing none of the AI models could get quite right). Sometimes I’d just stand on the sidewalk and watch the trees swaying gently in the wind, wondering if my eyes were just playing tricks on me or if the leaves were truly morphing into those strange, unnatural shapes.!#@p!#@I finally decided to stop on Sunday after I had labeled over 1500 videos. Unfortunately, this wasn’t quite enough to win the NVIDIA board – another student had labeled 700 more videos than me. Instead, I won a Qualcomm Snapdragon Development Kit – less cool than the NVIDIA board⁠03 but, as Professor Han assured me, still plenty powerful for running a large language model. All for the low, low price of my sanity.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14FE7063-2A50-4908-BA91-2E8E304A3F08-400x300.jpg]!#@Shortly after receiving the kit, I got an email from Scale AI⁠04 about participating in a “fun coding challenge” that was clearly just another data labeling task for benchmarking a large language model they had developed. I think I’ve learned my lesson about labeling AI-generated content though, so no thanks, Scale.

The Craziest 3 Days of Soccer Ever by Emiko P. '25,"broken records, halloween practice, and senior day!",by Emiko P. '25,"November 4, 2024","Hey, everyone! It’s time for everyone’s favorite update… soccer season!!!#@p!#@We just wrapped up our regular season, and I wanted to share the last three days that led up to that, because a lot went down.!#@p!#@On Wednesday, we had our second to last game of the regular season against Wellesley. We had set a goal this year to not only win the regular season conference title, but to beat every single team in our conference that faced us. And after we beat Wellesley 4-1 that night, we were one step closer to that goal.!#@p!#@But that was not the most eventful thing of the night.!#@p!#@Our teammate Meagan R. ‘24 shattered a 20-year-old record by scoring her 53rd career goal that night against Wellesley – making her the MIT Women’s Soccer all-time leading scorer!! I think this quote by my dad sums up Meagan pretty well: “Dang, that Meagan is a problem.”!#@p!#@Indeed, she is. I have never seen any other player be so viciously shifty and unstoppable. Watching her sprint down the left side of the field, her defender huffing behind her (literally eating Meagan’s dust), and rip a shot into the upper corner of the net will never get old. She is our beloved leader, and we are so happy she decided to grace us with her silly and energetic presence for one more semester :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WhatsApp-Image-2024-11-03-at-12.45.19_47c60b8c-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/meagan_record_2-800x481.png]!#@Thursday was Halloween, which means it was time for one of the most iconic MIT Women’s Soccer traditions: Halloween practice. Every year, the seniors pick a theme and assign everyone a costume that they must wear out to practice. This year’s theme was sports, and the team did not disappoint.

And not only that – it was SENIOR DAY!!! As someone who has been on the soccer team since freshman year, Senior Day has always been bittersweet. It meant saying goodbye to the people I had looked up to and having to think for the first time about what the team would be like without them. I had never really considered how it would be from the other perspective, to look at the team and try to memorize every last detail – the memes in my locker from my psych buddy, the team huddled around our Hood Beav mascot, the casual jokes, the sharing (sometimes stealing) of candy from people’s lockers. Senior Day is when you take a second to appreciate the people, the sisters, the teammates. I am so grateful to have a team that brightens up my day, that supports me and loves me, and that just really wants the best for me.!#@p!#@Senior Day was amazing! We played Emerson, and we won 3-0! I might have scored the game winning goal ;) That was definitely a good Senior Day gift. After the game, we exchanged presents, the juniors gave some speeches, and we gorged ourselves on cake and Chipotle with our families and friends and teammates.!#@p!#@Also, in classic MIT Women’s Soccer fashion (in line with what seems to be the theme this week), we broke another record. With our final win against Emerson, we are the first team to ever go 11-0 in our conference in the regular season.

We also end it ranked #3 in the nation (which is also a program record!). Our season is far from over, though. We have the NEWMAC tournament next, where all the teams in our conference reconvene and fight over the tournament trophy. After that, we hopefully make our run in the NCAA tournament, where all D3 schools in the nation set their eyes on the prize of becoming a National Champion. This year, we definitely have our eyes on that prize.!#@p!#@The past few days of crazy team traditions and the culmination of an entire season of hard work is the reason why I love soccer and our team so much.

people appreciation post by Fatima A. '25,<3,by Fatima A. '25,"November 2, 2024","in the past months, I have felt the impact of various people around me on the quality of my life with full force. MIT is so vast and there are so many different people who make sure it continues the way it does. I wanted to appreciate the people who make my MIT experience what it is.!#@p!#@friends!#@p!#@this goes without saying so I will keep this short but my friends are genuinely the sole reason for my sanity in a time where one simply cannot afford such luxury. this semester, I have gotten to enjoy being a “Greek chorus” in relativity with Feli, aggressive nodding with Zimi in quantum, spending inordinate times working on relativity and the early universe with Jorian whose level-headedness is genuinely unmatched, playing copious amounts of redactle with Nora, making sure I am not losing funny points in front of Jonathan, the constant struggle of man to be like Matthew, the correct mix of wise and bully that is Prajna, the kind of unhinged humor that is unique only to Jenny and being bullied over text by Alan. and everyone else who I have failed to mention here, I appreciate you all so, so much.!#@p!#@instructors & mentors!#@p!#@I have been incredibly lucky with all my professors throughout MIT. this year is no exception. I have professors who I would take a bullet for, they are so good at teaching, are very kind and I have been enjoying all my classes so much. I am taking relativity with Prof. H and Prof. E, both of whom are just so great. recently, I got to watch an old School of Science video about gravitational waves that Prof. H appears in at the very end, which was really exciting.
my professor for the early universe is a legend and I will leave it at that. quantum is certainly one of the classes of all times in terms of the length of assignments and the first midterm was a time but it is clear that the professor cares about the class and the lectures are very well organized and understandable so I am enjoying the class despite the bit of pain. outside of technicals, I am doing a translations project for credit and my professor is so, so kind. for some of the Punjabi dialogues that I just couldn’t figure out (I am not really fluent in Punjabi and it doesn’t help that the dialogues are supposed to be gibberish), he actually asked his mom for help and gave me pointers, which I am eternally grateful for.!#@p!#@Keita, my graduate student mentor for my math UROP and Wati, my physics UROP mentor have been incredibly patient with me as I learn some of the foundational stuff and I could not ask for better mentors.!#@p!#@dorm custodial staff!#@p!#@simply, we would all cease to exist along with the buildings we live in. all these talks of the incredibly unique culture of MIT dorms and how they foster a community rely on people who make sure that the dorms are clean and livable and a home to so many of us. shoutout to Dennis, who in addition to all of this, also makes sure you never feel down when leaving the house in the morning. everyone on the floor will agree that he is unbelievably kind and patient and treats every single person with levels of enthusiasm every single day that I can only hope to even feign.!#@p!#@dining staff!#@p!#@I had a very complicated relationship with dining, well, it was not very complicated, I hated it. I am a very picky eater and having dietary restrictions plus having your food being completely switched isn’t the most fun combination. it took me very long to start being okay with dining hall food. only after this spring, when I was cooking for myself did I really became appreciative of the people who had been cooking for me. I have also had enough time to adjust that I do not mind dining hall food at all anymore so although I knew this before, I have really come to appreciate all the dining hall staff. I think it takes a great deal of patience to exhibit the level of consistent politeness that the grill chef holds. Randy and Marlene always make sure to ask about your days, the omelette chef now knows my order, there is a chef at Maseeh dining who always calls you “love,” people who I have inquired about dietary restrictions will let me know about unlabeled food when they see me and there are so many other staff people who continuously exhibit incredible levels of kindness and care.!#@p!#@(I am too awkward to ask for names so I don’t know all the names. there has been some dining staff appreciation with spotlights on different people each week but I don’t think they actually continued that past the first week or something. maybe, I have just not been paying too much attention.)!#@p!#@all the offices around MIT!#@p!#@I have my gripes with some offices around MIT, but the people I have interacted with have more often than not just genuinely wanted to be helpful. whether that be having answers to your questions or redirecting you to other resources and people, I am so deeply indebted to people in the math department and all the random offices I have reached out to over the years. unironically, one of the most important lessons out of my time at MIT is to just, email. there are resources and people for your help and you just need to reach out and inquire about them. Currently, I am especially indebted to Kim from the distinguished fellowships office of MIT CAPD⁠01 for knowing what I want to say before I say it, for unbelievable and true empathy and for caring passionately about students.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/people-appreciation-post/

The Photos of Freshman Spring 📸 by Fiona L. '27,My attempt to take a photo a day for an entire semester.,by Fiona L. '27,"October 31, 2024","The summer before college was my last summer of being 18, and thus my last year of eligibility for a ~special program~ my local library ran. They had little booklets at the front of the library for children to log the amount they read over the summer, where each booklet completed would be entered in a lottery for a $1000 dollar scholarship.!#@p!#@For kids up to age 13, the booklets only tracked the hours you read. For teens 13-18, the “booklets” changed into strips (perhaps meant to be bookmarks?) where you read and reviewed five books. I figured to optimize my books read/time spent ratio as an 18 year old, I would read short novellas and comics.!#@p!#@Spoiler alert: I didn’t win. Probably why the title of this blog is “The Photos of Freshman Spring” and not “HEY CHECK OUT THE $1000 I JUST WON!!!” But while reading one of these comics, Tsubasa Yamaguchi’s Blue Period, I stumbled upon an idea for a Cool Project™.!#@p!#@Blue Period is a manga about a high schooler, Yatora Yaguchi, who suddenly discovers a strong interest in art in his last year of high school and resolves to get into art school. In the first volume, his art teacher, Masako Saeki, assigns him “summer homework” meant to help him improve massively.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-30-at-4.09.45-PM-400x260.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-30-at-4.10.12-PM-400x749.png]!#@Somewhere, deep inside me, I also had the desire to improve massively in art. But I’d never seriously nurtured this desire before. I also knew I’d be way too hosed to have time for all of that.!#@p!#@So maybe, I thought, I’d just use this as an excuse to do a cool thing. Like Saeki said, it would be an exercise in visual art and composition. But for me, it would also be an exercise in ✨consistency✨, a mythical attribute I’d been striving and struggling to obtain for all of high school. I wondered if a daily photo would be the thing that would keep me grounded through a semester I knew was going to be crazy. (Because, to be honest, what MIT semester isn’t absolutely crazy?)!#@p!#@And so, I got started, one photo at a time.

It was a pretty crazy semester, since I was still learning what my limits were outside of PNR. But at least I was somewhat consistent? Even if I couldn’t take a picture everyday, I at least kept it up for four months.

Learning about the ABCs by Janet G. '27,"Apple Bake Competition, At Burton Conner",by Janet G. '27,"October 29, 2024","The Apple Bake Competition is an annual event held by the Burton-Conner⁠01 GRAs ⁠02 in the Fall of each year. It’s a competition where people bake a lot of goods with apples, to celebrate the bountiful fall harvest of apples and give us all a reason to use the massive hordes of apples we gain from the yearly apple-picking outings that MIT dorms help subsidise. For most people, it’s a great reason to wander down to the Porter Room on Sunday morning and grab some of the delicious dishes that people have cooked up.!#@p!#@For Conner 2, my floor, Apple Bake is a little more serious. It’s on our shirts, it’s in our blood, it’s the colour of our floor (apple-red). In the words of one of our floor chairs, Haylea B. ‘27, “Apple Bake is one of two mandatory C2 events per year”, so we might be a little obsessed with Apple Bake. It’s often because we have really good bakers and cooks on our floor, but it’s also because we are just really competitive people who want to defend our floor’s consecutive 25+ year history of winning Apple Bake. This year, we also decided to bring back our Varsity Apple Bake jerseys,⁠03 so we DEFINITELY couldn’t lose.!#@p!#@I am the Resident Peer Mentor⁠04 for my floor this year. I also happen to be a little obsessed with tradition of Apple Bake. Therefore, this year, my lovely frosh and I decided to get the tradition going early. For our first Floor Frosh Social event, they pulled together to bake a lovely little apple pie; it was an incredible test of teamwork, and in true C2 tradition, also test of the fire alarms. ⁠05 We thankfully saved the suite before they set off the whole building though, so I guess we’re innovating and improving from this tradition.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image14-1-400x516.png]!#@Every year, our floor has a sweet little spreadsheet going for Apple Bake — because even if we’re the smallest floor in all of Burton-Conner,⁠06 this does not stop us from submitting the largest number of entries. While quantity does not always mean quality (for instance, last year I hauled myself up at the bright and early time of 10am to peel some apples and print out some sus photos for some “experimental apple art”),⁠07 we have sufficiently incredible bakers and chefs to make some pretty darn incredible dishes.!#@p!#@Most of our work started Saturday evening. The entire floor smelled amazing by the time I came back around 9pm; as I quote Lidia P. ‘27, “the floor smells like ASMR for my nose”.!#@p!#@Now, I will be the first to say that I am not a baker. Unfortunately, this means that I am mostly useless in the context of Apple Bake, so I decided to try my hand at a few sculptures this year. I dragged Albert T. ‘26 with me to help me ideate and peel apples, and we spent about an hour trying to peel some apples in order to craft a “Big Ben” to pay homage to a sculpture from a few years ago. The attempt ended once I accepted that I could not plausibly find a way to stick long strips of apple peel onto a can of Peach Monster (don’t ask). At this point, we were too many apples in, so instead Albert had a moment of divine inspiration and we decided to go find some apple sculptures on Pinterest; these were MUCH more doable and below we have the end results!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-2-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image5-2-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image23-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image9-1-800x1067.png]!#@In the meanwhile, other people were cooking much more edible dishes.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image19-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image3-2-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image17-1-800x603.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image22-1-800x1066.png]!#@When Sunday morning came around, our suites were still busy cooking.

i will meet zendaya even if it’s the death of me by Aiden H. '28,a wide-ranging rant written while feverish,by Aiden H. '28,"October 26, 2024","I’ve always been a little bit of a hypochondriac, and while that is probably connected to a lot of deeper things than this blog can go into, there is one clear trend: I hate being sick.!#@p!#@I hate the idea of not being as productive as possible, I hate the idea of not being able to do something, and I hate having to just suffer without immediate solutions.!#@p!#@My first couple months at MIT have tested this patience immensely.  My second weekend here, a whole four days before classes started, I got COVID for the first time. And yet again, when I woke up this Wednesday morning with the taste of death lodged in the back of my hot, sticky throat, I was devastated. It was the common cold, which is, dare I say, the most passive aggressive illness because it’s not bad enough that you have reason to complain but it is enough to make you dysfunctional.!#@p!#@And as I much as I hate being sick, this illness was notably bad for two reasons:!#@p!#@#1: Zendaya!#@p!#@I am a lifelong, ride-or-die Zendaya fan. Not that bad that I know her exact location or have a poster of her on my wall, but just underneath that.!#@p!#@I try not to gatekeep things I like from others, but some of y’all act like you’re serious Zendaya fans when I have been there since day one. I’m talking Shake It Up days. I’m talking KC Undercover. I’m talking I watched Disney Channel longer than I should have for Zendaya. Of course I’ve kept up with the more recent stuff, too (Spider-man, Dune, Challengers, Euphoria).!#@p!#@At any point in my life if you asked who my celebrity crush was, the answer was Zendaya. If I could meet anyone dead or alive? Zendaya. Have dinner with any celebrity? Zendaya. Favorite song? Replay by Zendaya.⁠01 What’s my favorite movie? Zendaya.!#@p!#@Well, Zendaya is in Boston on and off until December filming the new Ari Aster⁠02 movie with Robert Pattinson. So when I received very vital intel⁠03 Wednesday morning that Zendaya was in Cambridge, I (emotionally) imploded. This was coupled with my later Google stalking that found Zendaya was directly across the river on Newbury Street⁠04 the night before just walking around and shopping.!#@p!#@This is the most statistically likely time I will ever meet Zendaya. If we tragically rule out!#@p!#@A) me becoming a superstar and meeting her through Hollywood connections!#@p!#@B) me moving to London and “accidentally” becoming neighbors with her and Tom Holland!#@p!#@C) Spider-Man 4 both filming scenes with Zendaya and Ned at MIT and allowing students on the parts of campus where they’re filming!#@p!#@then now is my time to strike.!#@p!#@But naturally, as both a good person and someone who isn’t camera ready when they are sick, I could never risk going out to hunt down stumble upon Zendaya when I can barely speak, look like a blobfish, and can infect her.!#@p!#@This sickness feels like a test. In a lot of ways, the universe puts me in a weird situation (casually living blocks from Zendaya for two months) and then takes me away from it. This is just what being sick has always felt like. As soon as I start to enjoy something or get my life figured out, everything just crashes down for a couple days, leaving me to overthink in bed. It happened as soon as I moved here, and it is happening again.!#@p!#@#2: The being sick part!#@p!#@Okay not super original but I just hate being sick. Most of the time I just lie and act like I’m not sick and just go about my normal things because I would rather suffer than lay in bed and do nothing.⁠05!#@p!#@Being sick in a dorm is (drumroll, please)…even worse! Now I’m afraid of both getting my two roommates sick and being annoying with my incessant melodrama about my woes. Most of the time not having my own room here hasn’t been that torturous, but it’s the moments like these that it’s very apparent that rotting in bed alone is a privilege, not a right.!#@p!#@So to distract myself from existential thoughts and complaining, here’s a list of everything I frantically jumped around between doing:!#@p!#@I devoured this show in a disgusting amount of time, but it’s not without reason. First, it’s almost Halloween so duh I’m gonna watch the most twisted stuff. Second, it’s a Ryan Murphy show, and ever since watching Glee and American Horror Story in 6th grade, I will forever try every show he makes. Third, I actually have very (mild) lore about the Menendez brothers. Because I was a little freak in my formative years, I had my true crime kick a lot earlier than everyone else. I was in 7th grade just obsessing over true crime documentaries, which is when my mom told me about the Menendez brothers. So the next time I was in L.A. I definitely made people go out of their way to take my to their house so I could see it. Ever since then we’ve been mildly connected (though, as a Coloradan, Jonbenet Ramsey is the best true crime story). Nonetheless, great show.!#@p!#@Every YouTube rabbit hole eventually leads me to live concert videos of my favorite artists, and for some reason this time it meant me watching Chappell Roan’s entire Lollapalooza set for a second time.!#@p!#@I fume every time at how good it is because I tried to go to Lollapalooza this year (spent pretty much all my money on tickets and flights and hotel rooms with people from high school I barely knew) only to find out the day after I spent all the money that I didn’t get Lollapalooza tickets, but that they had put me on an “official waitlist”. I got a full refund but that can never ease heartbreak like this.!#@p!#@At the time of editing, Tyler’s new album comes out in two days and naturally I’m tweaking. But of course, as Ticketmaster once again proves its personal vendetta against me, I was not chosen for the verified presale. It doesn’t matter though, because Tyler’s tour manager also hates me! (he’s in Denver in February but Boston in July, so the exact wrong times)!#@p!#@I was not a Halsey fan growing up during her rise, but when she released her rock album If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power with Trent Reznor, I fell in love with it. The new album is still kinda rock-based in a 2000s Evanescence and Avril Lavigne way that reminds me of the music I would put on my boombox when I was 5. My favorites are Ego, Dog Years, and Lonely Is The Muse.!#@p!#@Like any good addict, these are the very first things I do when I wake up in the morning. The Connections has been awful recently though.!#@p!#@Okay I’m gonna go take more DayQuil.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-will-meet-zendaya-even-if-its-the-death-of-me/

The Romance of Learning by Emiko P. '25,"rainy days, language tests, and a book called Babel",by Emiko P. '25,"October 23, 2024","I took a test early last week for my Japanese language and culture class.⁠01 I woke up early that morning to study for it, scrubbing the sleep from my half-conscious brain and heavy eyelids. I cracked open my textbook and traced out kanji characters, brushed up on Japanese geography, and drilled myself on the grammar we had learned in that unit.!#@p!#@Kanji characters and hiragana were still swimming in the back of my mind as I scootered across the bridge to my test. It was raining, and the Charles River was a churning, thick gray. Puddles of water sprayed up onto my backpack, and I wondered if I would be taking my test just the slightest bit damp.!#@p!#@The test began with an interview in Japanese conducted by my professor, where a partner and I were drilled on the differences between Japanese and English spoken word. We then moved onto the written portion of the test, where I assigned pronunciations to hordes of kanji characters – the slightest deviation of curve changing the kanji’s meaning entirely. I translated vocabulary and long-winded sentences, making sure to use one of the 32 new grammar strategies we had learned in the previous units.!#@p!#@After I finished the test, I wandered to Hayden Library, settling onto one of the cushioned seats by the massive windows on the first floor. The windows face the river, and the infinite dimples in the Charles let me know that it was still raining. I ate a sandwich and a Honeycrisp apple that my roommate gave to me after apple picking. It all tasted particularly sweet now that my test was out of the way. I had just started to read the book Babel the day before, so I picked it up and read a bit before my next class.!#@p!#@Babel is a fantasy novel by R.F. Kuang about a young Chinese scholar studying at Oxford in the 1830s, navigating racial and colonialist tensions. The setting aligns similarly with actual historic events, except for the fact that this world’s energy runs off mysterious and magical silver bars that derive their power from translating words between languages.!#@p!#@Thus far, the book had mostly been describing the main character’s academic adventures:⁠02 his sudden access to deep knowledge and his language translation research at Oxford University. Reading this book – imagining the young scholar working at a library similar to the one I was sitting in, dissecting literature, composing essays, and carefully assembling and puzzling over information like a Rubik’s cube – reminded me of myself that very morning studying for my Japanese test. In fact, in even broader terms, it reminded me of MIT.!#@p!#@I was reminded of my problem set for 16.851⁠03 that I had been wading through the past two days – twelve questions focused on a different aspect of satellite communication, power design, and image processing. I was reminded of the first 7.014⁠04 test this semester and how analyzing molecular interactions and compositions was a welcome puzzle. I was reminded that my work at MIT is an endeavor, an adventure – the equivalent of this magical version of Oxford and Babel. A part of me felt jealous of the main character, that he was lucky enough to read and devour knowledge and entirely devote himself to learning – until I realized that that is quite literally what I am doing at MIT and what I have been doing for over three years.!#@p!#@That realization was quickly followed by a feeling of crushing, immense gratitude for the opportunity to learn. Suddenly, studying for a test, grinding out a PSET in the library, and devoting every single brain cell to the task of understanding Thermofluids or Controls or Structures seemed like the most utterly romantic thing to do in the world. To devote yourself fully to the broadening and deepening of the mind, to dissect a problem down to its fundamental components, then to go through the mental rigor of recomposing the knowledge – so that by the end, you can sit back in your chair and understand how the world works just a bit better. All that work so that you can hold an everyday item in your hands and say, I know how this was made, or so you can look at the sky and say, I know how the Earth and Moon dance and spin.!#@p!#@It truly is a gift to be a student.!#@p!#@Swapping out one magical world for another, I closed my book and headed to my next class.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hayden-400x533.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hayden-400x533.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-romance-of-learning/
I walk a lonely road by Ellie F. '28,and it takes a lot of time,by Ellie F. '28,"October 20, 2024","As a resident of Simmons, one of the farthest dorms from Main Campus⁠01 , I spend a lot of time walking. But “a lot of time” is far too vague. When do I need to leave my room if I want to make it to class (mostly) on time? What routes do I walk on a regular basis? Which do I walk on a whim? To answer such burning questions, I started using a stopwatch to time some of the walks I’ve made.!#@p!#@On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I take 18.c06⁠02 in Building 45 at 11 am. Building 45 has a beautiful glass exterior, and as I enter, the all-wood space opens up to a giant staircase that I run up, two steps at a time. The colorful squares covering the walls on each side shimmer as I sprint past.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/building-45-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bulding-45-stairs-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@As the school year progresses, I find myself leaving Simmons for class later and later. I wake up just in time to catch breakfast, which closes at 10 am. I spend the rest of my time getting ready, reading my emails, checking my schedule, clearing off my desk, until—oh god it’s so late how did this happen I’m gonna be late to class oh god—!#@p!#@Sometimes, I know that I can make it if only I walk fast enough. I put on music, and I book it out the door and down that long stretch of Vassar St. I rush into my 5.111⁠03 recitation breathless, five minutes past the hour. That might sound like I’m late, but on MIT time, classes start five minutes after the hour and end five minutes before. I try to slow my breathing as I find a seat.!#@p!#@Other times, I have moved through denial, bargaining, anger, and depression until I have accepted in my mind and soul that I will be late. I still try to walk quickly, but my heart’s just not in it. So, on this day, my walk to 6.1210⁠04 took nearly six minutes longer than the walk to Building 36, despite nearly the same distance.!#@p!#@On Mondays, I have my 17.50⁠05 recitation at the lovely hour of 7 pm. I usually become aware of this fact at 6:30, so I speedrun dinner and hurry down Vassar St and across Mass Ave and through the turning halls of Building 1 until I burst into my classroom.!#@p!#@But I can take as much time as I want coming back. I look at the signs and posters on the wall and admire models of ships on display. I take a diversion to The Alchemist and take in the way the sculpture is lit up, how the numbers and mathematical symbols cast shadows on each other.!#@p!#@I love my walks back from class because it feels like time that is truly my own. I let myself stop thinking about lectures and psets and just exist on campus. I stare up at the clouds and wonder at the best way to paint them. I notice the way sunlight filters through the leaves that have now started changing colors. I stop by the display of pumpkins, gourds, and ornamental kales outside Stud⁠06 and read the chalk words on the pavement, advertising study breaks and frat parties, many of which are long past by now.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ornamental-kale-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/clouds-over-kresge-2-800x600.jpg]!#@My PE class for the first quarter was ballroom dance! Keen readers will know I love dancing, and that won out over my general distrust of PE classes. Ballroom happens at 7 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so, much like with my 17.50 recitations, I scarf down a dinner, return my plates, and practice competitive speedwalking down the street and into the Z Center. On this night, it was raining, and I let myself take some extra time to admire the reflections of headlights in the street.!#@p!#@I’ve only had to swallow my pride and actually run down most of Vassar St once. That was probably the most pure exercise I’ve gotten from PE.!#@p!#@I’m part of the DesignPlus learning community, where we explore design and making at our space in N52, which also holds the Morningside Academy for Design and various build teams. We have weekly lunch meetings, and on this day, I wanted to try a new route for getting there. Instead of walking straight to Mass Ave and turning along it, I crossed the railroad tracks and wandered between brick buildings until I inevitably met Mass Ave again and followed my normal path.!#@p!#@On Tuesday afternoons, I also have my DesignPlus seminar. My seminar is in the Forge and Foundry space below the Infinite Corridor, where we learn how to work with metals like copper, aluminum, and brass to make pendants and rings.!#@p!#@Through DesignPlus, I also get 24 hour access to its makerspace, and our technical instructor Bill McKenna often runs trainings on different tools and machines in it. I saw that Bill was running a sticker-making training right after my seminar, so I went over to learn how to operate the vinyl printer to create stickers featuring various Gauss puns.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sticker-printer-1000x563.jpg]!#@Every year, the MIT Glass Lab has a glass pumpkin patch sale to raise money. I was told that the best way to get in early was to wake up at the crack of dawn to retrieve a ticket to hold my place in line, so get up early I did: I set a 6 am alarm and actually got out of bed with it. And in my hoodie and slippers, I set out towards the tent housing piles and piles of multicolored glass pumpkins to get my ticket.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/glass-pumpkins-1000x1333.jpg]!#@I had planned to immediately go back to bed, but the sunrise was so breathtaking, I just had to walk to Harvard Bridge. I listened to Rachmaninoff as I watched the clouds turn from red to pink and reveal a thin crescent moon. And when I got too cold to keep standing there, I followed a flock of birds back to my bed.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/glass-pumpkin-sunrise-1000x750.jpg]!#@As a blogger (could you tell?), we have meetings twice a month, where we chat about our lives, upcoming events, and ideas for blogs while munching on snacks that taste twice as good because they’re free. It was at this meeting that I pitched the idea for this blog, as ordinary as it seems.!#@p!#@At MIT, it can be easy to get used to my daily life, but even something as mundane as walking is filled with strange and interesting tidbits of college life.

Sweet summer song by Uzay G. '26,,by Uzay G. '26,"October 19, 2024","Hey folks,!#@p!#@it’s been a while. I’ve been very focused and not in a writing mood for the last couple months, but I’m back and I’m excited to start cooking.!#@p!#@This summer has been full of new colors. Last semester was not the best, and I’ve been rediscovering a lot of beauty which I wanted to share a glimpse of here.!#@p!#@I stayed in Boston for June-July and then traveled and saw family for August. I was continuing my research with the Isola lab on inner optimization in language models.!#@p!#@I met people and took in new media:!#@p!#@Read some books!!#@p!#@I run a club called Firelight dedicated to doing a bunch of random projects and learning activities. The goal is to make a community for students to get creative outside of classes and take time to learn together. We did a lot of stuff this summer, notably the Summer 2024 Learnathon. I sent out this email:!#@p!#@People got together, ran activities, learned together, and met weekly to check in. I enjoyed it a lot and might do something like this again in the future.!#@p!#@Personally I participated in the following:!#@p!#@People did a lot of other things! It was really fun.!#@p!#@I traveled a lot this summer. I was in the US for a while and went around/visited friends, and then I saw family both in France and Turkey.!#@p!#@I began by visiting a friend in New York.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240608_235403720-1000x750.jpg]!#@We walked around a lot. We went central park and just loitered around a bunch of places, which is my favorite way of visiting a city. New York has something very pretty to it and I’d like to go there more. A few weeks later, I went to DC to visit another friend.!#@p!#@I had a voucher for this British airline for a cancelled flight, so I ended up going to Paris through London. This was a bit before the Olympics so it was very hectic, but I did a stop in Cambridge, UK to meet a friend there. The other Cambridge has this quaint town aesthetic ours doesn’t, and it was interesting to be there. It seems on average a bit more relaxed, but it was also summertime. The nature was pretty:!#@p!#@Then I somehow missed my flight from London to Paris (first time this happens), so I took an overnight bus to get home. The bus boards this ferry at 2 am and they give you food and then we crossed over into home territory. I arrived exhausted in Paris, and hung out with friends and went climbing a lot. I got cheap tickets to see the female lead boulder climbing competition!!#@p!#@Then, my large extended family (~25 ppl) all went to the mountains together. This is a tradition, as parts of my family are from these mountains in the Alps and we go there to hike and be together. Usually, almost everyday we do a hike, pack a picnic, swim in some cold lake at the middle of the hike, and then come down and make food for dinner. It was very pretty, and I feel very at peace in the mountains.!#@p!#@Then I saw the other side of my family in Turkey. I hadn’t been there in 5 years, and I worked on my turkish skills again and ate lots of great food. Turkish culture is warm and welcoming.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240828-WA0004-1000x750.jpg]!#@Here’s one of my nostalgic foods from going there as a child, these dough balls coated in syrup and cinnamon:!#@p!#@I’ve been pretty focused on research this summer. MIT’s undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP) allows you to easily get paid for working in a lab. Copying over from my last post, since I’ve been working on this for a while:!#@p!#@I’m studying in-context learning, or the phenomenon where language models like ChatGPT, given sequences of the form x, f(x), x’, f(x’), … ie input-output examples of a function f in their prompt, can generalize and figure out the value of new inputs, ie predict f(x) from x.!#@p!#@In particular in-context learning is interesting because it underlies a lot of the reasoning ability of the best language models, and it’s still relatively poorly understood. It’s important because we want to know to what extent models learn complex inner search procedures/inner optimization goals, and we want to be careful about what those goals are. Developing a better theory for in context learning is also useful to describe model internals and make better optimization procedures.!#@p!#@This summer focusing solely on research was useful as I’ve been developing on a lot of random skills / localizing things I need to get better at:!#@p!#@I think navigating mentorship in ML can be a bit challenging though, because of how fast paced things go and how busy everyone is.!#@p!#@Once I wrap up this project, I want to take some time to think more broadly about what I want to work on.!#@p!#@I’ve been thinking about a lot of miscellaneous things, which I’ll try to blog about this semester as a teaser:!#@p!#@Other than that, I’m looking forward to this semester (which is already a decent amount underway), in particular excited for:!#@p!#@Excited to be posting more from here on out, I’m trying to get my ML post out this following week.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240608_235403720-1000x750.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG-20240828-WA0004-1000x750.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/sweet-summer-song/
look at the stars by Janet G. '27,"hacking mit, six months at a time",by Janet G. '27,"October 17, 2024","How do you raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, design the merch that defines half of campus fashion, build software that powers hackathons from around the world, and do everything else necessary to run a thousand-person hackathon?!#@p!#@My friends have gotten sick of me yapping about HackMIT, the club I sold my soul to at the beginning of freshman fall and am now the director of. HackMIT is a club that helps facilitate Hacking⁠01 in its most conventional form: we hold a hackathon, where you spend 24 hours⁠02 building a project in CS and/or hardware. We run two hackathons every year — one in the spring for high schoolers (called Blueprint, and if you’re a high-schooler you’re eligible to apply!), and one in the fall for ~1000 undergraduates. Our Fall hackathon, aka HackMIT, is the biggest hackathon at MIT and one of the biggest in North America.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb_cover-400x148.png]!#@When I began writing this post, I realised that in fact HackMIT was more famous on the blogs than I had remembered.⁠03 However, most people haven’t talked about the process behind planning a massive event like this. Given that I’m crunched for time,⁠04 I’m going to do a mind-dump-way-too-comprehensive-distinctly-personal version of a “How to put on a thousand-person hackathon in six months” guide. Here we go!!#@p!#@As I noted previously, I sold my soul to HackMIT at the start of freshman fall. I was head of Corporate Relations for our Blueprint hackathon, and had a pretty good time. Sent a few hundred emails, infiltrated a few Parents of Massachusetts Facebook Groups, and both memed and was memed on at the hackathon itself.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bp-meme-2-400x890.png]!#@For some surprising reason I decided that I did not hate the hours and hours I’d poured into this club, so I ran for director during elections and bound myself to a 1.5 year commitment to being director of HackMIT. LOL!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image1-e1729112038491-800x1066.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image6-800x849.png]!#@We generally start planning for the hackathon around early April, when we recruit our Spring class ⁠06 and onboard them. We begin planning website designs, brainstorming improvements for our judging/registration infrastructure, and thinking about application logistics. We’re trying to paint a picture of the hackathon that we’re going to make happen in five to six months’ time, and for many of us who only vaguely experienced hackathons beforehand, this is pretty hard!!#@p!#@I admit I am not a hackathon connoisseur — HackMIT was actually the first proper hackathon that I ever went to. I definitely felt nervous about leading the club, even if I had helped organise Blueprint beforehand, and I spent a lot of time with my co-director Albert T. ‘26 to try and understand the vision we wanted everyone to share.!#@p!#@MIT’s spring term ends in May. Our fall term begins at the very start of September, and our hackathon usually happens mid-September. If you do the maths, this means that we have only 1.5 months when everyone is on campus, and the remaining work is done virtually. This is, unfortunately, PAINFUL. If you don’t remember the horrible times of online school back in 2020, think timezone differences, internet (dis)connections, and Z*OM’S CONSTANT NEED TO UPDATE.⁠07 I learned how to dial-in while travelling and how to inconspicuously eat my dinner at 9pm with my camera on.!#@p!#@Still, we had a lot of fun — I learned a lot about what people’s favourite animals and boba orders were, and we learned all the different ways to send reactions and stickers over Zoom. It was incredible seeing everyone put in so much effort despite their busy summers; we read over 3000 applications and launched our website and our annual CTF puzzles and managed to get everything going as smoothly as we could. I still remember when we launched our website — so many people messaged us raving about the Starry Skies theme that we had designed this year. It takes a star-studded team to build a starry-themed hackathon, I guess.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image3-800x864.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image2-800x516.png]!#@Summer slipped by through the ceaseless flow of meetings and emails. I landed after my six hour flight from London and dropped by BC FLEX⁠08 as soon as I arrived on campus; the overwhelming number of fresh faces and scheduled events told me welcome home in the most MIT way possible. One must imagine this metaphorical firehose⁠09 to be refreshing, even if the heat meant that I would’ve preferred a physical firehose instead.⁠10!#@p!#@As you might remember, HackMIT happens mid-September. So when I landed on campus, the clock for Hack was ticking down: we were at T-14. We staffed our booth at Midway⁠11 to entice encourage the frosh⁠12 to come to our information sessions (shoutout to everyone who came and sacrificed their voices to talk nonstop for ~2 hours), ran our information sessions with the classic “FREE BOBA” marketing technique, and spent the final weekend before HackMIT interviewing people to select our incoming fall class.!#@p!#@This was definitely a lot of work, but also a LOT of fun. I loved talking to everyone about why they were interested in joining HackMIT, and I will always be so grateful that so many competent and passionate people applied to join the organising team, even if it made our deliberations last over three hours. There were tough decisions and tense moments, but I’m very proud and excited for our Fall babies to work hard in Hack!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image5-800x625.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-e1729112578846-800x540.png]!#@So we recruited our Fall class. T-7. We hit our fundraising goals and confirmed the scheduling. Everything was getting REAL. The weather was getting GREAT (as opposed to the awful rainstorm weather last year). Unfortunately, my co-director got SICK, but it’s okay because he survived with two days of intense sleeping, various medicines, and some soup I made (which was clearly an integral part to his speedy recovery). The last few days flew by; we chalked the sidewalks, flagged the lightpoles, and postered everywhere. Our 7000 bottles of Soylent arrived and we made sculptures out of them. People started milling around campus lugging travel suitcases and asking for directions to Lobby 7. In the blink of an eye, it was now September 13th. T-1.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image13-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image8-800x625.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image18-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-5.04.23 PM-800x545.png]!#@The night before the hackathon, Albert, Maggie L. ‘27 and I were doing our final setup checks, and Albert and I stuck around to revamp our script before the opening ceremony. We left Stud⁠13 at 2am, counting how many REM cycles we’d get.!#@p!#@We began setup at 6am, and by the unprecedented time of 7am on a Saturday morning, we had reached a critical mass of conscious MIT students who were helping us set up. People were lugging our heavy merch boxes over to check-in, Hackers were waiting eagerly in front of the Stud, and you could catch the occasional pink hoodie running around to get sharpies and pins and whatever else people needed. I somehow landed myself three walkie talkies at once (which was more funny than it was useful), and we got everything set up. Our marketing team was decorating the Hacker lounge, which was ADORABLE, and after checking that probably nothing would burst into flames in a way that our team could not rescue, I went to do our sound check at the Kresge Auditorium.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image6-1-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image21-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hacker-check-ins-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image17-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/walkie-talkies-e1729143639564-800x870.jpg]!#@Opening ceremony was incredibly emotional for me. To stand on the stage and see everyone — the hackers, the team, the sponsors — was a grounding experience, and I swelled with pride to see how this all happened. Our keynote speaker this year was Annie Rauwerda, the creator behind depths of wikipedia, who had the coolest vibes and delivered a banger opening presentation. Sarah S. ‘27, who was in logs in two contexts at once, made the lovely connection to invite the MIT Logs⁠14 to come perform for her HackMIT Logs task.⁠15!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image12-e1729144120643-400x278.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image2-1-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image10-e1729144324116-800x1403.png]!#@And then it was the Hacking. For us, at this point, everything was set in motion; we just had to watch everything move like clockwork. The boba and Red Bull was a hit with everyone, the midnight Insomnia cookies were delicious, and I personally LOVED the therapy dogs who came to visit. Shoutout to Angela K. 27 and Jenny Y. ‘26 for compromising on the thousand-dollar petting zoo and getting us free therapy dogs instead <3 Tuxedo Tim (played by the wonderful Selena Q. ‘26) is also a typical major hit.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image24-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/red-bull-800x452.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tim-cute-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image11-800x1067.png]!#@I also continued a grand old tradition of being exhausted enough to sleep on a bunch of cardboard boxes as my bed. This year, Allison E. ’27 (a fellow blogger!) and Ojas G. ‘27 also visited me and gave me a much needed Mochinut & Boba break along with the sweetest postcard! I was very touched. I think they were very entertained.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison4-scaled-e1729145635278-800x1156.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison2.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison3.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mochinuts-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/janetboxes-800x466.png]!#@At the end of the day, we had to close the venue due to overnight restrictions. After tying everything up and doing a brief checkover of the venue, Maggie, Albert and I had some more judging logistics to confirm. Aside from being shorter than Olaf,⁠16 another commonality we share is the unrealised childhood dream of a sleepover with friends. Adulthood is about being mature and not doing stupid things, but to be mature one must obviously recognise the importance of fulfilling missed childhood dreams. As such, we lugged two of Hack’s many air mattresses into my room, chatted about logistics for Sunday, got sidetracked trolling Claire W. ‘27 (who lives right above me), and staggered our venue check-in shifts so we could each get four (rather than three) hours of sleep.!#@p!#@Sunday morning was thankfully calm and slightly tense, given that everyone was rushing to complete their final projects. Once the project submission period ended, it was crunch time. People started milling around the tables to present and judge projects alike, and I floated around the help desk to make sure that we were able to redirect lost judges and projects. Once judging concluded, we split off into separate groups to deliberate on decisions. This year, I managed the deliberations of the HackMIT challenge prizes, while my co-director and the Mentor & Judging points Susan H. ‘27, Emily C. ‘25, and Jenny Y. ‘26 finalised the overall prizes. We got everything together, and suddenly we were ready for the closing ceremony!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image1-1-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-17-at-2.27.32 AM-800x597.png]!#@The closing ceremony was a different flavour of emotional from opening. Alison S. ‘27, our resident photography talent and Finance head, spent two hours during the hackathon to edit together a BEAUTIFUL closing ceremony video. She edited “HACKMIT” to parody Chappell Roan’s smash hit “HOT TO GO”, and I’m honestly a little embarrassed to admit how I was tearing up while the song was telling us to touch our toes. Ridonkulous⁠17 did a great job hyping up the crowd, and we did a cute little swag throw (with mixed reception). Our winners were very energetic and it was very cute to see the products demo’ed. I think our projects were very cool this year :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alberts-meme.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MJM-43-800x533.jpg]!#@Once everyone had left after the closing ceremony, I blobbed on the floor for a while from exhaustion, and then picked myself up so that we could facilitate cleanup. There wasn’t much left, thanks to the hackers who helped us clean out most of the trash before the closing ceremony, so instead we mostly just had a lot of fun being inefficient with pack up. I relived my Hack ‘23 experience of being carted by Maggie around the Ice Rink (and returning the favour), our Marketing and CR teams made “the Sponsor Shirt” with every single leftover sticker we could find plastered onto a single merch shirt, and we donated a few hundred bottles of Soylent (a feat considering that we started with 7000) and Red Bull to the Banana Lounge. We packed everything up, took our sentimental team photos, and that was the end of HackMIT 2024.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image20-800x1067.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image14-800x1123.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/carting-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image25-800x1067.png]!#@Oops, this turned out to be a pretty long post; it’s been a long few months. I’m proud of what we did. We received a lot of appreciation and gratitude, and I genuinely believe our team deserves it. Everyone was great — from our lovely sponsors who ask us about our days to the hackers who help us clean up, it’s always great to know how many kind people are out there! But as I told everyone at our organising team dinner, the team will always have a special place in my heart.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image19-400x300.png]!#@A lot of people frame college as the time to prepare themselves for the post-college life, but there are also many people at this school who will do something just for the sake of it. The legacy of HackMIT is not something pre-professional — we just hold two 24 hour fun and goofy events every year — but we spend the entire year preparing for them. I could go on and on about the sacrifice and effort that everyone put in, all the late night calls that devolve into gossip sessions and life complaints, all the moments of comedy that feed our private meme slideshow. This hackathon happened because of all of our team’s hard work and I will be endlessly grateful for them, because at the end of the day, they are the people who made it happen. The thousands of emails,⁠18 battling Illustrator for asset designs, all the pull requests and merges. This is my thank you to every team member, for reminding me that we can build a community of people who are all so competent and dedicated to a cause because they believe in it.!#@p!#@Of course, the epitome of the team member comes in the form of our Committee Heads.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image15-e1729148155390-800x563.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image5-1-e1729148184405-800x573.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image23-800x600.png]!#@Maggie L. ‘27 has been there for me since day one,⁠19 and as the Logistics head she battled through massive spreadsheets and stayed with us for the worst of it. Special shoutout to her for not crashing the car and killing both of us when she drove all the way up from San Jose to meet up with me at Stanford <3!#@p!#@Claire W. ‘27, our amazing Corporate Relations head, brought so much energy with her crazy ideas to funnel sponsorships. Our conversations about sponsor logistics until 3am, even while both of us were slightly sick and dying in Oxford, definitely pulled through to push us even beyond the fundraising goal.!#@p!#@Alison S. ‘27, our Finance head, has been another integral part of my HackMIT experience, with her incredible reliability and photography talent. You would think that she is a typical high school junior grinding for college apps with her 7 clubs and 4 exec positions, but her atypical passion and powerhouse-ness drives her through everything to pull off some of the craziest projects I know.!#@p!#@Andrew L. ‘? and Richard C. ‘26 as our incredible DevOps heads were the unit of all time, and I’ve been so honoured to work alongside them for the entirety of my Hack experience. Their calmness was incredibly anchoring amidst the rest of us hyperactive heads, and I will always remember the number of times when I would wake up and they had pushed out some incredible feature (by virtue of another all-nighter).!#@p!#@Kimberly W. ‘26, or the insom(a)niac Marketing Head as we love to call her, has the most incredible view on design, and really pushed the branding of HackMIT this year to new (starry!) heights. Her honesty and dedication reminds me of a value system that sometimes the Tech School education overlooks: it is worth it to make sacrifices for something bigger than yourself, because it is meaningful to you and that is enough. She also taught me that in fact you can actually run a whole committee while doing a MISTI ⁠20 abroad in Armenia, as long as you just… don’t sleep for the most part.!#@p!#@This leaves the people who cannot be really defined as anything in HackMIT, because in a way they ARE HackMIT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hug-e1729148751753-400x275.jpg]!#@In the context of HackMIT 2024, whenever I say us, it mostly means me and Albert, my co-Director for this year. As co-directors, we operate as a unit and make all our announcements as a collective — we even make three-person group chats to send messages to any individual team member.!#@p!#@While we were walking back at 3am, after finally finishing up with all the logistics of HackMIT, Albert observed how it’s so funny that every director spends only six months working with their co-director, but it always feels like forever at the end of it. It’s not easy to dedicate 10-20 hours a week to this cause, all 52 weeks of the year, for two years straight — especially at a school like MIT that demands constant excellence through the technical culture and challenging classes. Still, it selects for a specific sort of person, who is willing to confront this risk and give everything to it anyway. I’ve seen many of my other friends who run clubs have this same dedication, and I feel incredibly lucky that HackMIT is structured in a way that we can share the load.!#@p!#@From personal experience, it’s hard to build truly deep friendships in college. The number of people you meet in college become an incentive to bobble around and meet new people, especially if you’re still young and full of energy. Time is also crucial for friendship, and MIT squeezes the time out of you through painful problem sets and challenging classes. This is not a post about the value of intellectual discipline; what I will say instead is that our workload pushes us to choose and prioritise things that we truly believe in.!#@p!#@As directors, we choose to work with each other for so long because both of us care about the cause enough to dedicate so much of our college life to it. The mutual respect and admiration it curates builds out friendships that last far beyond College. We were lucky enough to organise a mega-director’s⁠21 dinner while I was in San Francisco, and it was so awesome to see the legacy of directors who are still good friends to this day because of the time they had spent together. This sacrifice is all worth it, and for me thus far, it was worth it because Albert was there to guide me through both Hack and life beyond this club. I’ve told him this so many times, but again, thank you for everything. I’ll miss him a lot as he enjoys retirement, but we already pinky promised (like 5 times, actually…) that we’d be friends forever and now we’re adults so obviously this promise is now legally binding.!#@p!#@So, how DO you raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, design the merch that defines half of campus fashion, build software that powers hackathons from around the world, and do everything else necessary to run a thousand-person hackathon?!#@p!#@You find a family of some of the most talented, dedicated, passionate people you’ve ever met. And then you do it.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image16-e1729149765698-400x237.png]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb_cover-400x148.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bp-meme-2-400x890.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image1-e1729112038491-800x1066.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image6-800x849.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image3-800x864.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image2-800x516.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image5-800x625.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-e1729112578846-800x540.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image13-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image8-800x625.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image7-1-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image18-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-5.04.23 PM-800x545.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image6-1-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image21-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hacker-check-ins-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image17-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/walkie-talkies-e1729143639564-800x870.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image12-e1729144120643-400x278.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image2-1-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image10-e1729144324116-800x1403.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image24-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/red-bull-800x452.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tim-cute-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image11-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison4-scaled-e1729145635278-800x1156.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison2.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/allison3.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mochinuts-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/janetboxes-800x466.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image1-1-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-17-at-2.27.32 AM-800x597.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alberts-meme.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MJM-43-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image20-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image14-800x1123.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/carting-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image25-800x1067.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image19-400x300.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image15-e1729148155390-800x563.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image5-1-e1729148184405-800x573.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image23-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hug-e1729148751753-400x275.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image16-e1729149765698-400x237.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/look-at-the-stars/
love in the time of unlimited data by Kai V. '25,against kindness as utility,by Kai V. '25,"October 16, 2024","In Milan I was constantly toeing the line between speaking solely in English, which I feared would make me seem like an entitled American who thought the whole world should cater to the dominance of their own language, and being so insistent on communicating in Italian that it posed a legitimate obstruction to getting anything across at all. Having lacked the foresight to grind a Duolingo course on the flight there, my half-baked strategy was to affect a sort of sheepish self-awareness—as I butchered every Italian word that I directed at waitstaff, cashiers, and train operators alike—that I hoped didn’t cross the line into flippancy towards their language. I couldn’t tell either way, because whether I said grazie with total confidence or none at all, they’d switch to English immediately and unsmilingly: “Okay, bye.”!#@p!#@On the first afternoon, I walked into the least intimidating-looking cafe I saw in the neighborhood of my hotel, asked for a cappuccino, and pointed at the VEGETARIANO option under an unidentifiable menu item. I was determined not to use Google Translate, in part because my phone was at 3% battery. The man behind the counter moved to cut me a slice of vegetable-topped focaccia and motioned at the bread with the triangular pizza server to interrogate how large I wanted it to be. I kept saying “yes” no matter where he placed the blade: I was hungry and just wanted any amount of food.!#@p!#@I was visiting Milan to attend ECCV, the European Conference on Computer Vision. But I had a couple days free first, so I spent the first afternoon on sightseeing: basilicas, castles, museums. Finally I visited the Duomo, Milan’s central cathedral, which was the first architecture I’d ever seen to literally take my breath away—spiked by hand-carved spires rising to industrial heights, topped by life-size granite figures, the impossible product of six centuries of human labor.!#@p!#@Near the city center, a woman came running up to me and asked: “Español? Ingles?” I said yes to ingles, my Spanish was old and rusty. But she kept talking in Spanish anyway. She was a lost tourist who wanted to get to the canals. I didn’t know where they were any better than her, and I told her that: “No sé dónde están los canales.”!#@p!#@She gave a genuine laugh, maybe at the slowness of my Spanish dredged up word by word, but I think partly with relief upon communicating with someone who spoke her language, albeit badly. Then she thanked me and left.!#@p!#@I realized right after that although the interaction had lifted my spirits, I could have easily helped her by opening Google Maps and letting her type in the destination. In my selfish haste to achieve some idea of human-to-human connection through speaking the same language, I had actually failed her.!#@p!#@A few of my labmates and I rented a motorboat to go on Lake Como, which was less than an hour’s drive from Milan. The rental company gave us the boat with minimal guidance (“do not try driving too fast close to shore or the police will see you with their lasers and will give you a fine”), and then we were barefoot sprawling out on the deck while handing off driving, the white hull cutting through this jade green water that had a real gemstone-like quality to it, cloudy and sharp and glinting in the sun. Shouldered by enormous bluffs, the Alps blue in the distance, it was the most gorgeous place I’d been in my entire life.!#@p!#@The lake was really big, something like twenty miles tip-to-tail. We’d speed through the middle for a few minutes, the top of the boat lifting out of the water with how fast we were going, wind whipping my hair back. Then we’d see a castle or something on the bank and go up to it and putter along drinking in the old moss-covered dark-stone historicity.!#@p!#@“Can we swim?” I said. I’d brought my swim shorts to Milan because somehow I’d assumed that every Italian town worth visiting must be a seaside village of some sort. I’d pictured myself taking a dip in the ocean every morning before the conference. It was only after I arrived in Milan, swim shorts in tow, that I opened Google Maps and noted with horror that Milan was right in the middle of the landmass, several hours’ drive to the ocean.!#@p!#@At my request, we drove as far from both shores as we could, until the apricot-colored buildings dotting each bank became small and indistinguishable. My labmate turned off the engine; as it revved down we were enveloped in a silence punctuated only by the occasional drone of another faraway motorboat. I took off my clothes—I’d worn the shorts underneath—and dove into the water. Far from any landmass, flat turquoise stretching forever in every direction, it felt like I had been plunged untethered into the center of the universe, submerged in a warm sweet core where I could watch everything else happening without touching it.!#@p!#@We found, afterwards, a small restaurant—one little kitchen, one table outside—high in the hills, the kind of thing where you had to take a winding cobblestone path up narrow stairs to get to the unlit restroom. An Italian mother and daughter prepared our food—we ordered basically the entire one-page menu—while the father fed bits of it to a dog. We watched the sun set while eating from a charcuterie board. I felt tired of eating so much dairy, having been functionally vegan in Boston, but it was offered with such care that in some way I enjoyed it anyway. For the whole evening we ate and chatted and the mother would emerge from the kitchen at odd intervals to drape more blankets over our shoulders as night cooled the mountains. Late at night this other lady came by who visibly exerted greater authority over the dog than the father, who had been trying with little success to get it to sit on command. “It’s time to go,” the lady said with a snap of her fingers, and the dog trotted away obediently, meat still dangling from its jaws.!#@p!#@After presenting my poster the next morning in the ecology workshop⁠01 , I drifted around and found myself in a workshop on hand pose and dynamics. These researchers from Meta built a big sphere you would put your hand in, with hundreds of LEDs inside which turned on and off individually. Using this sphere, they could farm a lot of training data on how hands looked in different lighting conditions. “We realized people don’t want a cartoon of themselves in the metaverse,” they said. “They want their real bodies in the metaverse.”!#@p!#@They played a clip of a disembodied head talking, cut off below the neck; then the same clip cut off below the torso to illustrate the difference: “Our goal is to perfectly recreate all real-life communication in the digital world, and hands are very important for communication.” They needn’t have explained this. We were in Italy; everyone around us was gesticulating wildly at all times.!#@p!#@Another workshop covered large-scale video object segmentation. This meant recognizing the boundaries around distinct objects present in a video. In particular I was impressed by Meta’s Depth Anything model, which took a video as input and predicted the distance of each point of each surface from the eye of the viewer. The second version had just debuted and showed drastic improvements over the original—for example, the spokes on a bike wheel could be distinguished now, whereas before they would blur into the same plane. The researchers showed an example of an application: you would be able to rotate your phone on a call with your family and their background would shift with an exaggerated parallax that implied a depth not obvious over non-augmented video.!#@p!#@That night, I bid my labmates goodbye after getting gelato together and walked back towards my hotel. A breathless teenager rolled up to me on his scooter. “Casa Milan?” he panted. “Uhh,” I said. I got out my phone and found the place on Google Maps and handed it to him. He rotated the phone around to see what street he should go down. “Thank you very much,” he said emphatically, in his thick Italian accent.!#@p!#@That was the only time I made someone else’s life better in Milan, and my humanity had nothing to do with it. I had simply acted as a lossless enough interface between a human with a need and a phone with unlimited data.!#@p!#@There’s a difference between kindness as utility and kindness as connection. You’d think kindness as utility is what really matters: this kind of altruism improves our collective odds of survival and entails being selfless and rational enough to do what really improves the other person’s life instead of what makes you feel better. On the small scales of day-to-day survival that we’re evolved for, these align: picking mites out of each other’s hair, taking care of each other’s kids, accomplishing as two what we cannot as one. This is the kind of altruism we can augment by becoming more capable, more equipped to help, more prudent and attentive and understanding. More ubiquitous access to more powerful technology enables this kindness-as-utility: I can Uber my friend home, use Google Translate to have a real and productive conversation with someone whose language I don’t speak, or offer Google Maps to a lost teenager.!#@p!#@But a subtler flavor of kindness comes from trying to connect as humans, oversights and limitations and all. Offering cheese because that was all they had for a vegetarian; eating cheese even though I hate cheese because it showed they really cared about me. Tossing a cumulative steak’s worth of meat to the neighbor’s dog. My labmate giving me his sweater after I swam, not realizing its sleeve was dripping wet, only making me colder. Someone yelling telefono! Telefono! at me on the train, seriously alarming me at first until I realized they were trying to warn me my phone might fall out of my pocket. (Actually it’s just a really bulky phone.) Whether anyone apart from the dog gained utility from these interactions is questionable, but still they’re some of the moments I remember most fondly for the bright flashes of human care I felt, the instinctive, imperfect kindness, impossible to quantify or optimize towards.!#@p!#@These random, unpredictable interactions are why I try sometimes to avoid using Translate or using Maps or even charging my phone. But it’s harder to justify these decisions when they lead to increased inefficiency for everyone involved, even as the inefficiency, the time spent intentionally considering each other’s needs, forms the crux of human connection. With technology it is easier to provide utility to each other, either by achieving the goal of a given interaction more easily, sticking points of human interaction smoothed over by optimized text interfaces, or by saving each other time by skipping over the human entirely.!#@p!#@I could imagine a fully virtual ECCV by 2028. After all, by any conceivable loss function, this is the best future we can optimize towards. We’ll spare the collective thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions released from a hundred planes jetting to Italy just for us to bumble around, confusing waitstaff and standing in front of paper posters and waxing lyrical about how good we’ll all have it once this is simulated away. The cafe server will size my focaccia with kind, weathered hands holding a scuffed pizza server, with a latency of just a millisecond, two or three if my ping is bad, but in any case far faster than my jet-lagged brain could in person. The simulated focaccia will identify the precise neuronal clusters mapping to a savory creamy warm sensation and prod them in pulses of pleasure far beyond what the real life bread could deliver, which had been cold in the middle, cheese solid and tasteless, made marginally enjoyable only by the fact that I’d stepped off the plane an hour before. When I go sightseeing, the spires of the Duomo will reach so high into the sky (with the sensation of depth augmented by Meta’s Depth Anything v7) that at a glance I’ll fall to my knees weeping, the entire thread of human history funneling into my mind like a skull-shattering screwdriver. With my face and hands recreated faithfully, perhaps even augmented so that I don’t break eye contact or fidget with my watch like I do in real life and instead can give full attention to the person across from me, I’ll gesture and speak animatedly about my research in front of an interactive display rather than a static poster. During dinner with my labmates afterwards, I’ll think of their perfect presences with a fondness exceeding any feeling I could conjure now. “Do you remember back when this was held in person in Milan?” we’ll laugh. “It was so terrible. I got sick every time on the flight back home.” At the mention of a time when we suffered exhaustion and illness to see each other, at the thought of the people I failed before artificial augmentation made me wiser and kinder, at the memory of cold sweet water piercing my abdomen and the ecstasy of being alone with my friends in the center of the world, my heart will swell with the blood of machine compassion.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/love-in-the-time-of-unlimited-data/
Taking the L by Kayode D. '27,"On ""failure"" at a place like MIT.",by Kayode D. '27,"October 16, 2024","I never wrote a blog recapping last semester. I thought about it quite a bit this summer and I think I wrote a few drafts but none of them really ever came to anything. Among all the thoughts, only one feels all that important to share with applying students: taking the L.!#@p!#@Y’all, I’ve taken so many L’s.!#@p!#@Physics L!#@p!#@The summer before you come to MIT, you have to take a math assessment. This essentially assess your skills and recommends a math course for you. Your advisor is also informed of this suggestion. It’s through a system called MITx, which is like a big interactive textbook a lot of Psets are done through. I did well in Calc BC in high school, so I didn’t study for it. I already know the material, right? I can make up excuses like that I didn’t know the syntax of MITx, but the short of it is that I failed. MIT Test #1: failed. Of all the possible classes:!#@p!#@Math: 18.01⁠01 , 18.02⁠02 , 18.01a/18.02a⁠03 , and 18.022⁠04!#@p!#@Physics: 8.01⁠05 , 8.02⁠06 , and the accursed 8.01L [Physics Long – same as 8.01 but goes an extra month in IAP].!#@p!#@I got recommended 18.01 and 8.01L, but that had to be a mistake, right?!#@p!#@When I met with my advisor, I told him I wanted to take 18.02 and 8.01 but he strongly suggested I take 18.01 and 8.01L[DUN DUN DUNNN]. I tried to argue that I could handle it and the assessment was a fluke, but settled to take 18.01 and 8.01 and only drop if physics became too hard. Which it did. The people I did work with were already so accustomed and clocked into the material that they flew through it and I sort of rode their coattails by Psetting together and not really learning the material on my own. I bombed the first exam and got an email asking if I wanted to switch to 8.01L. On thanksgiving day, I begrudgingly agreed. I took the L.!#@p!#@8.01L felt like something out of the Breakfast Club. 8.01 met in a large conference room next to the Outfinite⁠07 and had hundreds of students in it, taught by some of the most well known and beloved professors at the institution. 8.01L met in the basement under the Stata building and had 20 people in it. Let that sink in, 20 people. I felt like a failure! In my mind I had sunk to the lowest point you could at MIT, to the dumbest class there was for the most fundamental topic!!#@p!#@But just like the swim class (another common Kayode L), I was so wrong!! 8.01 L was 1000% the correct choice for me. The class wasn’t anything different, it was just the same material with better pacing. The class was split up and had enough professors and TAs that every pair had someone that could help with questions and walk though problems that we didn’t understand (of which there were many). And the small class size? Amazing! Not only was everyone on equal footing when we approached problems, but some of these people have become my closest friends at MIT! This class isn’t for “dumb” students at all, it is quite literally a normal physics class in every way. From the outside, it is just MIT physics with an extra month (which just meant more physics experiments and a final project that was more fun⁠08 than it was hard.) I have plenty of friends who have told me they regret taking 8.01 over 8.01L, and that they wish they could have taken the better paced and less intense 8.01L if they could go back. Also, the final isn’t in December with everything else so that’s less stress, too.!#@p!#@My point: This L wasn’t that bad.!#@p!#@Common Coding L!#@p!#@As a course 2A6 I am studying Mechanical Engineering with Computer Science, so I wanted to take the first coding class, 6.100. There’s 2 options for this:!#@p!#@I had done enough coding in high school to feel comfortable signing up for 6.100A, but quickly realized I would be better suited for 6.100L. I signed up for 5 classes this semester⁠09 so I took the L and switched to 6.100L. You have to decide this switch by the end of the very first week, and once again, I felt dumb for swapping. And THEN once again I realized that this class isn’t dumb, it’s quite literally a normal intro to coding class. We fill an entire lecture hall, too, so I wasn’t alone, and it’s the same amount of work, with only 5 Psets for the whole semester!!#@p!#@Once again: This L was better in the long run.!#@p!#@Broken Computer L!#@p!#@It was during my first and only test in 6.100 A that I realized with horror that my computer’s keyboard had stopped working. Everything worked fine except for the number keys, which only let me use 5 and 6. So I had to do an entire timed coding exam with only the numbers 5 and 6 (I would go 6-5+6-5+6-5 to get 3, or have to copy it from somewhere on the page). This has been infuriating, and the rough draft of this blog had things like “eighteen-oh-one-a/b” written in place of numbers. I got a 50% on that one.!#@p!#@This past week I had ANOTHER coding exam, so I got a keyboard from the admissions office to use in case my numbers stopped working again. But that couldn’t save me from what was coming. I opened my computer an hour before the exam to the Black Screen of Death. My cursor was visible and could move, but no button or click did anything, not even the power button. I was screwed.!#@p!#@Luckily, I remembered a message I had seen in passing on the blogger Slack channel, where Ceri R. was offering to give away her old laptop that she didn’t need anymore. I quickly messaged and went to claim it from her. Success! I took the exam and am now typing on said computer. After the exam, I went to the IS&T tech help desk to see if they could save the non-backed up files on it, and the guy at the desk (I kid you not) just held down the power button longer than I did and the computer turned off and back on again. So I go to the #1 tech school in the world but I can’t restart my computer? Major L.!#@p!#@Music Theory L!#@p!#@This one stings the most.!#@p!#@I love music. With a passion. I have 4 half written blogs where I just talk about the music I like and why I like it so much (that will hopefully see the light of day soon). I took 21M.301 – Harmony and Counterpoint I this semester. This is the first real music theory class, after 21M.051 – Fundamentals of Music. I felt I was ready; I know scales, I know chords, I should be good!!#@p!#@But if the rest of this blog hasn’t made it abundantly clear, I took another L and I wasn’t fully prepared. I underestimated what I was lacking from not playing a melodic instrument. The class focused on a thing called Partimento (which is hard to explain), and I realized I was the only percussionist in a class of classical musicians and acapella singers. We had to write melodies, and while my rhythm and percussion was beyond fire, the musicality of my melodies were lacking when compared to what they should have been, and my professor reached out.!#@p!#@He thought I should drop the class this semester, and take his Fundamentals of Music class to prepare for retaking .301 next fall. I was extremely disappointed with the situation and myself. This class was taking so much of my time and I wasn’t even doing well in it. And I love music!! But I remembered something I saw on a t shirt a while back:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/swim-shirt-front-rotated.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/swim-shirt-back-rotated.jpg]!#@It was on a free shirt we got at orientation. The quote read “There are no traffic jams along the extra mile.” This was true for the Swim Test, and the Physics Class, and now Music. I shouldn’t fear taking the time to learn the “long” way. After all, MIT is a marathon, not a sprint!!#@p!#@So I dropped music theory. Now I have a lot more free time, but I’m planning on coming back to the class next fall to try again.!#@p!#@L: accepted. 😔!#@p!#@So what’s the takeaway of all of this?!#@p!#@I think all MIT students fear failure to some capacity. I’m scared of trying new things because I’m afraid of being bad at it. Which yeah, sounds dumb on paper but its true. I can sit in a room with thirty⁠10 MIT students— some of the brightest students in the world, and the professor can ask a question and no one will answer. It’s not because no one knows the answer⁠11 , but no one wants to try and be wrong in front of everyone…except for people in the front row. These people know the room is full but they can’t see it. All they see is the professor and the board. I think that when you learn to tune out distractions and forget about comparing yourself to others, you can start to actually thrive. Comparison is the thief of joy, after all.!#@p!#@I fail. A lot. I have little or big failures every day and that’s ok. It takes a lot of trying to get through life, and a lot of failing, too. The Bible even says in James 1:2-4, “My brothers and sisters, be very happy when you are tested in different ways. You know that such testing of your faith produces endurance. Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete, and you won’t need anything.” This refers to being tested in faith, and it applies to a lot of kinds of tests, too. Because I went through the failures I did, I learned a lot more than I think I would have had I never failed.!#@p!#@And this reminds me of another thing I say a lot! I saw it on Instagram, and it said that “The man who loves to walk will go farther than the man who loves the destination.” Learn to love the journey more than where you’re going and you’ll go a whole lot farther! Then you won’t be disappointed if you don’t exactly hit the target, because you’ll have gone on a great walk. Mmm, put that in your happy meal!!#@p!#@Ok, I’m done with the Dad quotes. Go fail and learn and grow into the person you want to be! Or don’t, but learn from it anyways.!#@p!#@Song that inspired the blog:!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/swim-shirt-front-rotated.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/swim-shirt-back-rotated.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/taking-the-l/
how the first midterms actually were by Aiden H. '28,xoxo gossip girl?,by Aiden H. '28,"October 15, 2024","Contrary to popular (and probably well-founded) belief, I once was psychic. Not only did I successfully predict the 2021 Pantone Color of the Year (with a Google Slideshow as evidence) and COVID-19⁠01 , but I believed in my abilities so much that I genuinely go around telling people and even wrote college essays on the topic.!#@p!#@Tragically, I am here today to confirm that I have lost my powers.!#@p!#@MIT is infamous for humbling people, so when our first midterm season⁠02 rolled around I was casually prepared to use the phrase “C’s get degrees” and move on with my life as soon as possible. But–in the least ignorant way possible–wow! these exams are really hard and mentally draining! When predicting my scores, I failed (kinda?) a test I thought I aced, passed a test I thought I got a 30% on, and had no clue on the others? Never did I think that even the wrath of MIT could shake my solid foundation of psychism, but I stand dumbfounded.!#@p!#@Fortunately, I am taking 3 GIRs⁠03 and a class essentially everyone takes anyway, so I’m here to explain how your first midterm seasons at MIT will realistically go, class by class, and spread the TMZ-worthy insider-deets about what our exams are actually over.!#@p!#@18.02 (Multivariable Calculus)!#@p!#@My first midterm was for 18.02, which has been my favorite class so far so I wasn’t particularly stressed? I haven’t taken multivariable calc before, but that turned out to not put me at a disadvantage because the class started with a mini linear algebra unit instead to introduce random concepts we would need for the rest of the class.!#@p!#@Lecture is three times a week (Tuesday/Thursday/Friday) with recitations⁠04 on Monday/Wednesday. Psets for this class are the shortest I have with a mix of online and written out problems that are due on Tuesday nights.!#@p!#@What was covered:!#@p!#@Looking at it in list form looks like a lot considering there was only 8 lectures before the exam, but the class runs really smooth and a lot is covered each lecture, so there was no “we literally never learned this” panic like there was for other classes.!#@p!#@Like most GIR exams, since the class was so large (>400), we had the split the exam location. Half were in 26-100⁠05 , but I was in Walker Memorial⁠06 , which gave me the amazing opportunity to walk along the river and develop a deep anxiety before the test!!#@p!#@In all seriousness, the hype around the “first midterm” and how hard MIT is definitely psyched me out for this test. I’m fortunate to not typically have test anxiety, but the amount of sweat that dripped on my paper during the exam was criminal. Was the test hard? No. Was it different from any practice problem or pset⁠07 ? No. Did I choke anyway? Of course!!#@p!#@I walked back to my dorm fully believing I got a 30% and immediately started busting out laughing with my roommate about how awful we felt we did.!#@p!#@In the end, we both passed and had days of nerves and melodrama over nothing, and this class continues to be my favorite.⁠08!#@p!#@17.41 (Intro to International Relations)!#@p!#@The same Friday as my 18.02 exam, I had my first paper due for my HASS class⁠09 .!#@p!#@Technically this wasn’t a midterm exam, but it was still a larger assignment at the same time with the same weight in my grade. A lot of HASS classes will actually have one midterm exam and one final exam with a few papers sprinkled through the class. Since this is my CI-H⁠10 , I count the paper and my suffering equally as much.!#@p!#@Except I actually wouldn’t call it suffering because I generally enjoy this class? I did debate in high school so I have a general understanding of the concepts we’re covering in class, just not in a formalized and academic way. The first half of the class is the overview of the main three theories of international relations, with the first two papers being us having to apply them to current international news, and the second half will be issues/dilemmas/other parts of international relations that are important (climate change, nuclear weapons, proxy wars, etc.).!#@p!#@The prompt for this paper was: “Having read the US National Security Strategy, assess how well the United States is adhering to its own strategy. Offer at least two examples of international relations situations where the United States behavior supports the position taken in the essay. Provide a counterexample to the stated position and explain why it  doesn’t sway the ultimate assessment.”!#@p!#@Despite being very tame, in a true procrastinator’s fashion, I started the paper the day before and still managed to finish it on time and clutch a passing grade. Not the most applicable class to others unless you’re going to major/minor/concentrate in course 17⁠11 , but an untold truth of MIT is that even in the middle of all the psets and midterms, I will still have to open MLA Citation Machine.!#@p!#@5.111 (Principles of Chemical Science)!#@p!#@The following Monday I had the dreaded 5.111 exam. The general consensus across the class, including the upperclassmen⁠12 , was that this was where we were gonna all fail.!#@p!#@Naturally, I decided the weekend was to cram.!#@p!#@Except I didn’t (oops!). I studied for a decent amount the day before with the exam review the professor posted, but unlike the psets for the class, it was very emphasized the test was going to be conceptual and almost entirely long answer, which I find harder to study for because it’s not the same as memorizing equations or practicing a specific type of problem.!#@p!#@The class structure isn’t specifically noteworthy: lecture Monday/Wednesday/Friday, recitation on the days between, and psets are due Friday nights.!#@p!#@What was covered:!#@p!#@I took two years of IB chemistry in high school and by no means was some chemistry godsend, but I assumed coming into the class that I would know enough to not have to break my back over the class. But this first section of the class really shows why MIT doesn’t give credit for high school chem, because never did I talk about light’s wave-particle duality as in-depth as I needed to for this exam. It wasn’t overly complicated or difficult, just a lot of really niche concepts that you have to be able to explain in extraneous situations⁠13 .!#@p!#@Leaving the test, though, I was sure I passed with a near-perfect score. I answered every question, finished early, and was never confused–the polar opposite of the 18.02 exam.!#@p!#@The surprise on my face when I received a failing grade⁠14 was priceless. My first MIT blindside had occurred, and it was only two days before my worst fear…!#@p!#@8.01 (Physics I)!#@p!#@What I would do to not have to do physics. Tax fraud? Arson? Casual murder? All on the table.!#@p!#@One time I was convinced I wanted to be a physicist, but then I took AP Physics C: Mech in high school and it was genuinely the worst class I’ve ever been in.⁠15 I’m just genuinely not interested in physics. I understand that it is super important and I get why it’s a GIR, but it also makes me slightly homicidal and those two things just have to coexist.!#@p!#@Considering I took mechanics in high school and didn’t entirely fail, I expected to feel like a solid 5/10 in this class. By the first exam, though, I was sure I was going to have to take this class eight times, fail each one, and eventually never graduate. The concepts aren’t that different from mechanics for the first exam, but pretty much 75% of the AP content I remember was covered in 3 weeks and the extent of the problems was 1000% greater. What is really different is where the emphasis for the problems is. Whereas AP was “get the right answer”, 8.01 is “do you understand this through vector decomposition” and “can you use differential analysis to derive this equation”.!#@p!#@The structure of the class is kind of a flipped-learning style, which MIT calls “TEAL”. Unlike the other classes, there is not one lecture section for everybody, but a bunch of smaller classes that meet with different professors. We watch lecture style videos on our own time that are due on Sunday and Tuesday of each week, and then you meet with your section twice a week to review the video content and do practice problems with your group. Then on Fridays every section meets and completes 2-3 problems with their table group that count towards the week’s pset, which are due Wednesdays.!#@p!#@What was covered:!#@p!#@Looking at all this doesn’t look that bad, and when I started reviewing I noticed that too? One of the professors released a 3 hour review video that pretty much did near-identical free response questions to the exam, and I vow to protect that man with my life because that was the most educational and mind-opening three hours of my life.!#@p!#@Coming out of the exam, I also felt shocking fine? And when I got my grade I also did shockingly fine?!#@p!#@Somehow the class I hated the most I got the highest score in.!#@p!#@6.100A (Intro to CS Programming with Python)!#@p!#@The same day as the 8.01 exam, I had a “midterm” for 6.100A. Except it isn’t really a midterm because this class doesn’t really have exams. The class is a 6-credit, half-semester class with near-weekly psets that take anywhere from 1-8 hours and 4 “microquizzes” instead of midterms, which are 25 minute in-class coding quizzes every week or two. Like the homework, the quizzes vary from the easiest problems I’ve ever seen to questions I genuinely have no clue how to answer.!#@p!#@Since the class moves really fast, it looks like a lot of content, but if you have any coding experience, the first half or even the whole class will be pretty easy.!#@p!#@You might think you have no interest in coding or course 6⁠16 , so you’ll never have to worry about this class.!#@p!#@Wrong. Want to do aero/astro? 6.100A. Archaeology? 6.100A. Materials Science? Nuclear Science? Brain and Cognitive Sciences? All of them. Everyone has to. You can’t escape it (unless you do, like, chemistry).!#@p!#@What was covered:!#@p!#@I actually passed this quiz (which I cannot say for all of them.) and I was definitely more focused on the 8.01 exam, so there’s not much to say except that it happened and the next quiz was already a week later.!#@p!#@Overall the experience wasn’t as traumatic as people like to make it out to seem, and I wouldn’t even call it comparable to AP weeks in high school (but that might be because I’m in the easiest classes rn). And now that I’ve procrastinated three hours by writing this, there’s nothing to do now but start studying for the next ones⁠17 .!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-the-first-midterms-actually-were/
Pictures from a Month into Classes by Richard O. '28,and I'm thrivi... surviving?,by Richard O. '28,"October 14, 2024","MIT is a weird school. Seriously. If I asked you to picture a normal scene on this campus, you would probably be wrong (very, very, wrong). In the past month, I’ve done everything from holding a ferret in our hallway to climbing a rock wall on the side of a student-built wooden fort next to a 360-degree student-built gyroscope ride in the middle of one of our fields. I’ve seen students participate in a petting zoo in front of our dorms and watched my roommate smash random electronics on the sidewalk with a metal pipe. I’ve consumed an inhumane amount of boba which seems to be the number-one catered item for all events on campus and casually stood in an elevator and spoke with a co-founder of AirBNB who was giving a talk on a different floor (and I had no idea who he was the entire time we were in the elevator) – but this sense of unseriousness while having fun is one of my favorite things about this school because it reminds me that formality is something we don’t actually have to follow when we don’t want to.!#@p!#@So with that, I’m going to try my best to give you all a glimpse of my fun, ridiculous,

If I had a nickel for every class I was taking this semester… by Andi Q. '25,I’d have 4.5 nickels.,by Andi Q. '25,"October 12, 2024","I’m a crusty senior now, so I have no fun and sparkly adventures to write about like the first-year bloggers have been doing (at least not for this week). However, what I do have as a senior is the freedom to choose fun elective classes without worrying much about prerequisites or fulfilling major requirements. I love talking about the classes I’m taking because they contribute so much to my enjoyment of MIT, so here’s what I’m taking this semester.!#@p!#@This class is the long-awaited sequel to 6.2050 (Digital Systems Laboratory I) – the intro FPGA class I took last fall. 6.S965 is all about revealing the inner workings of the black-box tools we took for granted in 6.2050. For example, much of our work in 6.2050 relied on hardware simulators that magically work; in 6.S965, we spent the first two weeks discussing how they work. We also learn about many techniques in modern digital hardware design that we weren’t smart enough for/didn’t have enough time to cover in 6.2050 – design verification, software-defined radio, and anything else that Joe Steinmeyer (the lecturer) thinks would be cool for us to experiment with. And just like 6.2050, there’s a big final project that I’m excited about, except now we get to use FPGAs that are more than 10x as powerful as the ones we used in 6.2050.!#@p!#@Surprisingly, most of the code we write in 6.S965 is in Python. Although Python may seem like a blasphemous choice for a hardware engineering class (where you’d typically see a low-level programming language like C or Assembly), it makes everything we do so much easier. A complicated testbench that would’ve taken me hours to set up using 6.2050’s infrastructure now takes me about twenty minutes using Python, with much more readable code to boot.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pynq-400x286.webp]!#@The “S” in the subject number means that this class is a “special subject” (typically a limited-edition or experimental class about a new or niche research area); in this case, it’s the first time that Joe is offering 6.S965. It’s admittedly not the most polished class (yet); sometimes things⁠01 just don’t work even though Joe or the official documentation⁠02 said they would, but that’s the standard experience when working with hardware anyway. As a result, the class is much more open-ended and student-driven than other classes I’ve taken at MIT. It’s a lot like what I imagined/hoped MIT classes would be like before I applied.!#@p!#@Several of my friends are taking 6.S965 with me, and Joe is a great lecturer (who also brings home-grown cucumbers to lecturers sometimes). Overall, I’m having a great time in this class.!#@p!#@This class is my first statistics class at MIT! I’m still not entirely sure how “mathematical” statistics differs from regular statistics, but I think it’s all about formally proving/disproving statistical results typically presented as empirical facts. For example, if you’ve taken a statistics class before, you may have learned that 30 is the magic number of samples where the central limit theorem kicks in; however, that’s not always true, and we proved that in our latest problem set.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-12.04.42 AM-800x360.png]!#@6.S951 is by far my hardest class this semester. Many seemingly obvious results are surprisingly difficult to prove formally; sometimes, those “obvious” things aren’t even true at all. It’s extremely mind-bending, but wow is it satisfying when things finally click. I feel like I’ve learned more linear algebra in this class than in 18.06 (the actual linear algebra class), and I finally understand why the matrix trace operator is so important now.!#@p!#@Admittedly, taking 6.S951 as my first statistics class is probably 90% of why it feels so hard. Two of its prerequisite classes are 18.650 (Fundamentals of Statistics) and 18.100 (Real Analysis), and I’ve taken neither. So while the other students (most of whom are PhD students who research statistics) write up super elegant proofs like this:!#@p!#@I write up horrible monstrosities like this:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2-400x580.png]!#@Definitely not my brightest idea in hindsight.!#@p!#@Despite the difficulty, taking this class was still a pretty good decision. I can keep up with the content because Professor Stephen Bates explains things well, and he thankfully doesn’t gloss over proofs or definitions he deems “trivial”. Plus, I’ve learned a lot, especially from thinking about analogies that make these unintuitive results make more sense. Aside from 6.S951 being my only class with exams this semester, I have no regrets about taking this class. I might even take the sibling class, 18.656 (Non-Asymptotic Mathematical Statistics) in the spring.!#@p!#@This class is the coolest-sounding class I’m taking and the one I most looked forward to… but it turned out to be the most disappointing. Not that the content isn’t cool; quite the opposite – one of our assignments involves getting a large language model (like a smaller version of ChatGPT) to run entirely on a laptop⁠03 . However, these assignments all boil down to filling in a few lines of code and pressing “run”, and I’d hoped that there’d be more to them than that. The lectures cover so many interesting topics (like custom computing architectures for deep learning), and I wish that more of them would make it into the assignments.!#@p!#@I suppose it isn’t necessarily bad that the assignments are like this though. Machine learning tools like PyTorch have become so good that we only need to write a few lines of code to build powerful machine-learning models. And the assignments would probably be far too complex if we had to implement everything covered in the lectures from scratch. (Imagine if the poor TAs had to help debug 200+ students’ homemade ChatGPT clones…)!#@p!#@Still, I’m enjoying the class because the content is fascinating. It’s a culmination of almost everything I’ve studied at MIT, from computer architecture to machine learning. I think there will even be some quantum mechanics in the final two weeks of the semester! There’s also a final project, which should hopefully be much more exciting than the assignments.!#@p!#@Also, Professor Song Han is possibly the most overpowered professor I’ve had so far at MIT. Almost every lecture is about some new technique that he and his group pioneered in hardware engineering or machine learning. The papers linked to these techniques would often have hundreds of citations too, and have won the best-paper award at whichever prestigious conference they first appeared in. Many of the charts we see in lectures end up being some variation on these two charts:!#@p!#@This class is one of the most fun classes I’ve taken at MIT. Not only is it a music class (already a strong indicator of being a great class), but it’s also a class about Fourier transforms, dynamic programming, and linear algebra! The class is taught by Professor Eran Egozy – creator of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and veteran of the music technology industry. I especially love how he takes abstract algorithms and shows us how they were used to create technologies we use every day, like Shazam’s music recognition and Spotify’s song recommendations. It’s always cool to see real-world applications of things you learn in class; it’s even more cool when your professor is someone who created or worked on those applications.!#@p!#@Another great thing about 21M.587 is how interactive all the algorithms are. It makes understanding them so much easier when you can download an audio file, plug it into the code, and visualize how the algorithm processes the music. We do everything in Python, which makes it easy to implement all of this in just a few lines of code.!#@p!#@This class doesn’t cover machine-learning approaches to music processing⁠04 but instead focuses on more “fundamental” signal processing techniques. However, these techniques are still remarkably effective (and often outperform their machine-learning counterparts). For example, in our most recent problem set, I synced up two vastly different recordings of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata – one played on a grand piano and the other by the Eight Bit Big Bad – using these fundamental techniques.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dtw.png]!#@Last (but certainly not least), I’m in MITWE again! It still brings me as much joy as it did when I joined the ensemble in my freshman fall semester. That’s why I keep coming back, seven semesters and counting :)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pynq-400x286.webp;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-12.04.42 AM-800x360.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2-400x580.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dtw.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/if-i-had-a-nickel-for-every-class-i-was-taking-this-semester/
climbing the wall by Veronica P. '27,why so defeatist?,by Veronica P. '27,"October 7, 2024","There are a lot of phrases in the english language that can be used to describe me- “athletically inclined” is not one of them. I can appreciate and enjoy a sport, but never with a true passion that exceeds, say, a month at a time.!#@p!#@All this to say- when my friends invited me to go bouldering with them (think rock climbing but without a rope), I thought it would be a fun, one-time-only endeavor.!#@p!#@And the outing began pretty much as anticipated. I got some climbing shoes, chalked up my hands, acquainted myself with the wall, and attempted the beginner level- success!!!#@p!#@Ever the perfectionist, I resolved to complete every route for the base level (V0) before I could upgrade myself to the next one (V1). Only then could I prove my “worthiness.”!#@p!#@I soon, however, hit a roadblock: chipping away at the same routes again and again just to be met with the same pesky rocks I couldn’t quite reach, the same steps that left me resigning myself to the mat, unable to progress beyond the most rudimentary of levels. By then, I had convinced myself that my one, initial success didn’t “count”. The technique was all wrong, it was beginner’s luck.!#@p!#@After what felt like the millionth one of these attempts (more realistically- probably the eleventh), I wiped my hands and let my sigh- half exertion, half defeat- propel me back towards our station at the end of the mat, where my friend had been watching from a distance; I wasn’t the only one who was tired of my routine.!#@p!#@“It’s like you’re deciding you can’t climb these walls before you even attempt them.”!#@p!#@Immediately, I knew she was right. Every movement I made- and didn’t make- was laced with doubt: I can’t reach that far, I don’t have the momentum to get there, I’m not strong enough, I’m going to slip, I’m going to fall, I’m going to lose my grip, I’m already losing my-!#@p!#@Often, we make decisions about the outcome well before it’s arrived: I’m going to bomb that interview. I’m going to fail this test. I’m not getting over this heartache. I’m not getting into that college. I’m just going to embarrass myself. I’m just wasting my time.!#@p!#@Maybe we’re right. Maybe we’re wrong. Maybe we have reason to believe the things that we do. Maybe it’s best to manage expectations.!#@p!#@But when you know you’re going to attempt it regardless, there’s no point in psyching yourself out about the outcome. If you tell yourself you can’t climb that wall, you’re going to approach it as someone who can’t climb it. You’re going to discourage yourself from reaching for that next step. When you feel yourself start to slip, you’re going to let yourself fall, you’re not going to see the point in trying to recover it. You’re going to be right.!#@p!#@So, I looked at my wall, and I told myself that I could climb it. Poetically enough, I did. Just for good measure, I climbed another. The next weekend, I biked back and climbed an even harder one.!#@p!#@(Whatever your wall is, you can climb it too. )!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/climbing2/
Trail Notes by Sara N. '28,,by Sara N. '28,"October 6, 2024","Summer in Alaska, I learned this July, is an exuberant, unrestrained triumph of nature. For just a few months, the landscape alters dramatically: the snow folds into itself & the green pushes out; fireweed lights valleys and mountaintops alike with a sharp, consuming pink and rivers grow heavy and silver with fish. The air is warmer, though not warm, and on brighter, bluer days, that perpetual mist wrapping around mountains dissipates slightly, its sheen broken through by sunlight. Despite never reaching the heavy heat of Kentucky summers, summer in Alaska feels more concentrated, more intense, though all of Alaska is like that – it demands full attention.!#@p!#@My summer at home, before and after Alaska, was mellow. Restful, if aimless. I re-read all the Newbery-winning books I loved in elementary school and worked my way through a beautiful collection of nature essays my neighbor gave me as a graduation present. I went on long morning walks and ate many large meals every day, and on most days, found time to nap on our staircase’s landing, one cheek pressed against the carpet, the other facing the sunlight.!#@p!#@Nearly twelve uninterrupted weeks of this, and then: MIT.!#@p!#@The month I’ve spent here thus far reminds me of the Alaska I saw in July. This school, too, feels extreme and intense and demands my full attention, something I fear I’m not always giving it. Some days, I stay up late enough to witness the sky begin to lighten, and I remember those equally persistent summer days in Alaska, where the sun would only begin to dip below the horizon near midnight and would be back up by 4. I walk through the Infinite Corridor and get that same giddy rush I felt in Alaska whenever my family would pull over into a scenic viewpoint, when we would get out and stand just the width of a road away from the base of a mountain and crane our heads upwards, our eyes tracing a pathway up until our line of sight would disappear into the skyline. Standing that close, I could never see the top. I remember that awe, that sense of disbelief, thinking just how incredible, how unlikely it is that I stand on the same ground as such giants, that both of us exert some force on this planet. It was – and MIT is – a rapid expansion of context, a humbling rescaling, this epiphanic realization that the world I am growing into is so much larger than anything I could have imagined.!#@p!#@The essay collection I started this summer and brought to MIT with me is called Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teaching of Plants and is written by Robin Wall Kimmerer. Kimmerer is a botanist and an author, and Braiding Sweetgrass is “an intertwining of science, spirit, and story.” It is a generous and warming collection, with each essay affirming the deep and time-honored relationship between humans and nature, but also serving as a reminder of the values that rest at the roots of the ecosystem we are all a part of: generosity, reciprocity, fundamental kindness towards ourselves and others.!#@p!#@One of my favorite ideas that I’ve come across in the collection is the rejection of the “recognized hierarchy of beings” common in the Western tradition, which places humans at the top and plants at the bottom. Instead, in indigenous knowledge, according to Kimmerer, humans are often referred to as “the younger brothers of Creation;” as one of the youngest species, we have much to learn from the world around us.!#@p!#@My friends and I joke that “there is no original experience,” but I truly believe this and think this goes even beyond the sort of universal experiences we have as a race; it also extends to other species, and I think it remains true on both the molecular and macroscopic level. I watched a biology lecture over the summer that explained that simple biotechnology problems – isolating certain molecules, cutting specific segments of DNA, etc. – faced in modern labs were solved by observing and adapting the behavior of primitive bacteria. This, I think, is the meaning of interconnectedness: every fundamental struggle, every ultimate question we face about the nature of things, has probably already been reckoned with by some species before us.!#@p!#@On our last day in Alaska, my family went on a guided three-mile hike within the Denali National Park and Preserve. It was easy and mild, more a nature walk than a hike. We were led by a wonderful ranger who pointed out all the little things we never even would have thought to look out for. I took notes: a running list of details, sentence fragments vaguely transcribing some of the stories our ranger told, and isolated scientific words and phrases I wanted to look into later.!#@p!#@What I saw that day:!#@p!#@1. The labrador tea plant, which is a small shrub with dark, shiny leaves with slightly fuzzy underneaths— Labrador tea leaves contain ledol, a toxin that causes cramps and paralysis, though when boiled, it is used to make herbal tea with medicinal properties. Our ranger said – and I have unfortunately not been able to corroborate this anywhere else on the Internet yet – that when boiled past a certain threshold, the labrador tea leaves once again become poisonous.!#@p!#@2. Many, many willow, birch, and dogwood trees, though the tallest were around three feet tall and the shortest were just a couple inches— Alpine dwarfism is a common adaptation within trees living in harsh arctic and subarctic environments; permafrost limits root growth and soil acidity limits nutrient availability, so for trees approaching the treeline, scaling down in size and growth is a fundamental requirement for survival.!#@p!#@3. Lichen, which grows like a copper-green crust upon rocks and trees— In one of her essays (“Umbilicaria: The Belly Button of the World”), Kimmerer writes that lichen “blur the definition of what it means to be an individual, as a lichen is not one being, but two: a fungus and and an alga.” The alga, being an autotroph, produces all the energy and the fungus collects minerals and maintains the moisture levels necessary for the alga to photosynthesize. Their symbiotic relationship is supported by a tightly intertwined architecture – fungal filaments wrap around and directly penetrate algal cells to deliver nutrients and siphon off sugar.!#@p!#@To study the lichen relationship, researchers attempted to recreate it in a lab setting. When conditions were ideal for both the fungus and the alga, they were surprised to see that nothing happened. Eventually, the experiments were neglected, and as a consequence, the resources within the petri dish started to diminish. It was only under this stressful environment that the fungus and the alga came together to become lichen.!#@p!#@4. A recently-deceased spruce tree with visible scarring from a beetle infestation— Spruce bark beetles are native to Alaskan forests, and have maintained a tensely balanced relationship with the forests they feed upon. In the summer, these beetles bore holes into the bark until they reach the phloem. Laying hundreds of eggs and releasing pheromones to invite others, the beetles push the tree to its capacity, gnawing through its phloem and cutting off its access to nutrients until the tree starves to death. Healthy trees have their own defense mechanisms – they are able to release bursts of sap that either flushes the beetles out or drowns them – so the victims of bark beetles are usually trees weakened either by age or disease.!#@p!#@This delicate, brutal balance has recently been disturbed by warming conditions. Summer now arrives earlier, and the beetles, dictated by simple biological instinct and nothing more, have now compressed their life cycles into half the original time. This means that summers now contain two attacks, and healthy trees weakened once by the first attack hardly have time to recover before the next.!#@p!#@Evidence of the beetle outbreak is obvious and unavoidable. As we drove across Alaska, we noticed huge swathes of forests discolored, the landscape stained with large masses of trees colored reddish-brown instead of the usual mint green. The dead trees stood like skeletal ghosts. Still standing, but in all ways that matter, gone.!#@p!#@“But it’s not their fault,” our ranger had said, regarding the spruce bark beetles and their changing biological cycles and the resulting massacre of trees. “They can’t help it.”!#@p!#@In a world where a simple existence of any kind is miraculous by definition, I sometimes wonder — what does it mean to be a human? We are, of course, one node in a vast, interconnected web, but there is also something that undeniably sets us apart.!#@p!#@There is an academic answer: a recent study found that the distinguishing feature of human intelligence is not our social reasoning or our ability to build and use tools, but is our ability to process and share vast amounts of information.!#@p!#@I think this is ultimately what makes us different from spruce bark beetles – we are ruled by more than just instinct.!#@p!#@Being human means we can read books and make art and learn from the world around us and become better people. The fact that we have greater agency and control over our actions and lives than most other species means that we are not only capable of change, but are designed for it.!#@p!#@This past month, this has become a sort of affirmation for me. On days when I feel overwhelmed by the change from Kentucky to MIT, I try to imitate nature. From the labrador tea plant, I am learning that the search for balance is ultimately a function of trial and error, and that the inherent nature of life is that I’m bound to get things wrong before I get them right. I am learning from the alpine dwarf trees, who know there is no shame in bending down and starting small if it’s necessary for survival, and who know that anything worth doing at all is worth doing poorly at first. And I am learning from the lichen, who know that hard times call for immeasurable kindness and partnership.!#@p!#@But being human means that I can also deviate if I choose to – unlike the lichen, I don’t necessarily want to discover the wonders of connection only when I’m at the precipice of catastrophe; I want to appreciate all that is around me, even while it is abundant. Especially while it’s abundant.!#@p!#@I am not always doing my best at all of these things, but I am trying, and I will get better.!#@p!#@One of my most fervent beliefs is that the most beautiful things in this world — gratitude, warmth, the kind of enthusiasm that gets you rambling — are abundant and overpowering, as long as we remember to intentionally and explicitly keep in touch with them.!#@p!#@Inevitably, there will be discomfort along the way. For me, coming to MIT is a little like a fishbowl being dumped into the ocean. It can be overwhelming and uncomfortable, but the discomfort is a symptom of growth, and is thus an ultimately positive process. The fish born in a fishbowl is inherently lucky to have ever even seen the ocean.!#@p!#@This is my goal for my college years: to be grateful when overwhelmed, and when comfortable, to be fueled by excitement rather than panic or urgency.!#@p!#@As one of my favorite bloggers wrote in 2012: “If I didn’t love the world and want to interact with it in a big way, I wouldn’t have come to MIT.” As the poet Jessica Abhugattas said in a poem I have loved recently (Eureka!), “Here in the heat / is where I need to be. This world is frightening; / I’m trying to enjoy it.” And as per one of my favorite lines from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: “This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.”!#@p!#@If I ever require a little more inspiration, the world around me is evidence of the fruits of discomfort. Our Earth has faced six mass extinctions; I am facing college.!#@p!#@I think about the Alaskan land at the cusp of summer. Great, vibrant things await it, and it hardly knows. Spring is the season of softness, so the land must be at its most vulnerable before it is at its prime. I imagine that first thaw, those first roots breaking through the ice, the discomfort the land must grow round with before it tips towards transformation. And then— the fireweed, the sunshine, the blue, the green. The transitory awkwardness is forgotten, and exuberance becomes second nature. At its core, how can my experience be any different from the land’s? We’re both part of the same story.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-5-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-4-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-14-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-15-800x533.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-5-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-4-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-14-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-15-800x533.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/trail-notes/
The Halls are Alive by Allison E. '27,with the sound of mischief :),by Allison E. '27,"October 2, 2024","Let’s face it, MIT’s campus is not known for being the most gorgeous of all college campuses. I personally like the mix of ultra-modern glass and steel, traditional marble, and cracked windows covered with peeling paint (it feels both exciting and homey!), but objectively speaking, campus is not beautiful.!#@p!#@The hallways inside these buildings can be even less aesthetically appealing–I think MIT has a vendetta against ceilings (if you look up, there’s always some array of pipes, wires, gratings above), and the walls are covered with an eclectic mishmash of posters. Again, it’s not beautiful. But I would argue that it’s something better: lived in. The hallways of MIT are alive.!#@p!#@From well before 9:00 am to well past 9:00 pm, the academic side of campus is filled with the tense energy of students shuffling between exams, and the awe of passing tourists, and the laughter of friends walking three-aside. But they’re also alive with various displays of creativity and mischief. These are some of my favorites from the past year:!#@p!#@Impromptu Concerts!#@p!#@There’s a piano sitting in one of the most trafficked thoroughfares on campus, just outside of 26-100⁠01 . People are constantly playing music on it (pop songs, classical pieces, etc.), but my favorite instance was a particular rendition of “All of Me,” by John Legend. I was sitting on a nearby couch, eating my lunch when it started out–just one person playing the piano. And then someone joined in singing, and then another, and another, with an audience growing in the hallway. Everyone disbanded as soon as the song ended, but it was awesome :D!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_1145-scaled-e1727927079929-1000x927.jpeg]!#@Juggling in Lobby 10!#@p!#@Many a night I’ve returned from a 7:00 pm class or a late club meeting, and walking through Lobby 10⁠02 I find three or four people just… juggling! They’ve got colorful props, much whimsy, and seriously impressive skills. I think they do this pretty regularly, and it always makes me smile.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4796-1000x750.jpeg]!#@Free Listening!#@p!#@There’s this person who will occasionally sit on the steps of Lobby 7⁠03 with a sign that says “Free Listening.” I’ve never actually gone up to them before, but sometimes I’ll see someone else talking, and they’re just nodding along. Pretty cool.!#@p!#@Spot the Robot Dog!#@p!#@MIT’s Stata Center is a building with… many quirks… Some are annoying, some are interesting, but one of the coolest is seeing an unnervingly life-like robot dog(?) occasionally roaming the halls. Meet Spot, the Boston Dynamics robot that jumpscared me while I was waiting for my next class to start! It looked completely unsupervised at first, as if it was just going for a casual stroll through the halls 😆!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_3994-1-1000x754.jpeg]!#@Free Polaroids!#@p!#@I was walking to class one day, and standing along the side of the hallway was someone with a polaroid camera. They called out, offering to take a free photo for me! Unfortunately I was a bit late, and couldn’t stop, but that was so wholesome.!#@p!#@Mysterious Boxes!#@p!#@This year, April Fool’s was the first day after spring break, and we returned to campus to find those yellow question mark boxes from Mario scattered all around the hallways. They were kind of everywhere, and were filled with various prizes? treasures? mysteries? inside! A few of the boxes I saw just had playing cards, but I also saw some more interesting items–a poll on PSet submission preferences, instructions on how to shower, and my personal favorite: unlabelled sheet music at the 26-100 piano that, upon sight reading in my head, turned out to be a Rickroll⁠04 .!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_041711-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_035151-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_150348-1-scaled-e1727926962381-800x600.jpg]!#@Conga Line !!!!#@p!#@Picture this: It’s the day of the MIT Science Olympiad Tournament, and hour 13(ish) of helping run the competition. There are fifty some-odd organizers packed into a room, trying to make sure that 16,000+ pages of exams have been fairly graded. It’s chaotic. Things are running behind schedule. We’re waiting frantically for more papers to come in. I leave to use the bathroom and for a blessed moment of quiet.!#@p!#@And then, as I’m walking back, I see thirty, maybe forty people forming a MASSIVE conga line down the middle of the hallway. To this day I have no idea who this group was (they weren’t tournament competitors) or why they had gathered⁠05 . But I was dead tired, and screw it, this was really funny, so I joined the back of the conga line. In a couple yards, the hallway widened into the spacious Lobby 10, and two by two the line started forming a human tunnel⁠06 . I was the last in the line, so they ushered me, cheering, through the center of the tunnel. The next-to-last person followed right behind me, until the entire tunnel had unraveled itself.!#@p!#@And then… everyone just dispersed? I don’t know where they went 😭. But anyways, I returned to checking over Science Olympiad tests with a bit more energy :)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_1145-scaled-e1727927079929-1000x927.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4796-1000x750.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_3994-1-1000x754.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_041711-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_035151-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240401_150348-1-scaled-e1727926962381-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-halls-are-alive-2/
[Guest Post] How to Build a Three Story Fort by Ceri R. '16,by Zack I. '27,by Ceri R. '16,"October 1, 2024","I’ve had all kinds of feelings about returning to MIT as staff a decade after I was a student here, but one of them is ✨delight✨ at seeing new generations of MIT students carry on traditions and make them their own.!#@p!#@As admissions officers, we talk about one way the residents of East Campus exemplify our motto—mens et manus—with their yearly Build. The details of the project change each year, but it’s always ambitious, driven by passion, and a feat made possible by community. In fact, when I first got to the office, our information sessions even showcased a picture of the 2015 roller coaster (which I rode, and which some of my classmates helped build.)!#@p!#@I’m really grateful that Zack I. ’27 offered to write up his experience as a project lead this year, giving you all a peek into this slice of MIT culture, creativity, and chaos. Everything below the line is his writing!!#@p!#@My name is Zack and this year, I was one of the project leads for East Campus Build. Every year, East Campus⁠01 designs and builds a large-scale construction project to throw a big party⁠02 on it as part of REX.⁠03 In the past, we’ve built rollercoasters, a rotating climbing wall, forts, and more. This year, we built a three story fort with a bouldering wall and net suspended in the middle of the second floor :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-1-redo-1000x776.png]!#@We started work on the morning of August 9th with surveying and flagging out the footprint. Doing this accurately is relatively challenging, however. One of the other project leads had past experience lining soccer fields and introduced us to the method he learned back then. We took three lengths of string, two of which were cut to the side length of the overall footprint, while the third was cut to the hypotenuse length. When all of those strings were held end to end to form a triangle, we knew the two side lengths had to form a right angle between them. We then flipped the triangle to mark the other side of the fort’s rectangular footprint.!#@p!#@This method is effective in theory, but again the physical implementation had a few main challenges. Our first issue was that the strings were slightly elastic, meaning once stretched the length was actually longer than what we measured it to be. We only have one measuring reel long enough, so for future years we’ll buy two more reels to form the triangle with them instead. Because our lengths weren’t perfectly accurate, our angle wasn’t perfectly 90 degrees. A small deviation from 90 degrees at the corner leads to wildly inaccurate measurements longer down the line, and it caused our overall footprint to slightly shift into a parallelogram. We did our best to combat this by holding up speed squares as a reference, but it was difficult to completely eliminate the parallelogram problem with the tools we had available to us. Once we had flagged out the positions within a margin of error we were comfortable with, we dug the holes and water-leveled the concrete blocks placed inside of them for the posts to sit on.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-2-redo-1000x624.png]!#@And then we could start using the lumber! To begin, we constructed the ground frames and laid them on top of the blocks. This was where our first wood cut inaccuracies began to arise. 2x4s usually come in 96 inch lengths unless you specifically buy longer pieces. The side length of each rectangular fort unit is 96 inches⁠04 and people assumed that all of the 2x4s could just be taken and used for assembly straight out of the pallet. In reality, while most 2x4s were accurately cut, a sizable percentage were 96.25” or 95.75” or some permutation of mildly incorrect that went unnoticed until the piece was measured. When all of our ground frames were assembled and placed onto the blocks we found that the overall width and length of the fort were something like an inch or so off each. We should have taken the ground frames apart and recut the lengths that were slightly off to ensure everything was completely the correct dimension, but at the time we decided it was within our margin of error and chose to proceed with starting work on the second floor.⁠05!#@p!#@First, a little background about what exactly we needed to do to get a second floor unit in place. In recent memory, East Campus forts have been constructed from rectangular platforms we call fort units. They are supported by four 4×4 posts at each corner, and the posts are connected by girders bounding the sides of the top rectangle. Down the middle, perpendicular to two of the girders, we attach the center spine that splits the unit into two equal halves. The two girders parallel to the center spine are connected to it via 9 joists spanning horizontally across each half. After the joists are in place, we screw 3/4” plywood over the top as flooring and that forms the basic fort unit structure.!#@p!#@Beginning an upper floor means posts. Post raising is always the primary bottleneck with build because it requires a lot of hands to get the massive⁠06 4×4 post raised vertically, level on all axes, hammered flush with the ground frame, and screwed into place. We had to structure our priority schedule around post raising taking place during the times when the most people were onsite. This meant the mornings and afternoons were usually spent measuring and cutting wood to the correct length in preparation and the evenings were dedicated to getting as many posts up as possible. Another thing we changed this year was the length of the posts we would raise. In the past we raised three story posts in one piece from the ground and they required a lot of manpower. This year, we chose to keep some parts of the posts in components and raise them to just their second story heights at first. Then, once the second floor was complete, we would raise the top half of the posts and attach them to the components below. This made it possible to make substantial progress with fewer people.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-4-redo-1000x596.png]!#@We decided to reverse the classic East Campus tradition of procrastinating the stairs⁠07 until the last day and finish them very early on. Marlow T. ‘27, one of the other project leads, had taken point on the stairs during the design process, so she primarily led their construction. The main concern she wanted to focus on with the stairs design was to ensure we didn’t have to manually cut the side profile for each step into the stringers.⁠08 The stringers are made from long⁠09 2×12 pieces and we don’t use that type of wood for anything else so we buy very few of them. It’s difficult to cut the side profile accurately without weakening the wood. To avoid having to go through that time-consuming and difficult process for 2 out of the 3 stringers, we screwed 2×4 scrap into the side of the stringers at the correct height and angle so that the step ends could be supported on top of them. Stairs have a lot of small and intricate cuts that make them very time-consuming, so we set aside an entire weekend in our schedule to focus on their construction. This proved to be a great decision because having functional stairs that early on drastically improved our mobility while constructing the second and third floor.!#@p!#@After we finished the stairs, we returned to the main fort structure. It took about a week to get the components of the second floor frames up, and finishing that roughly corresponded with the first night prefrosh were here for FPOPs. One night, Paola R. ‘27⁠10 brought 20 prefrosh in one big group who all wanted to help build. We didn’t have enough tools for all of them at once, but we were able to set up an assembly line with half of them carrying the plywood sheets up to the second floor and the other half actually screwing the sheets in. I expected plywood flooring to take about a day to finish, but Paola’s army decimated the task in like two hours.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-5-redo-1000x751.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-6-redo-1000x563.jpg]!#@It may seem like it, but build isn’t entirely run by project leads and upperclassmen. Build is specifically designed to be beginner-friendly and an opportunity to learn basic construction skills and tool use, so freshman participation is encouraged. After the freshmen moved in for orientation week, we had them installing crossbracings to fortify the structure. There are two crossbracings in each corner of every unit, which meant this build required over a hundred total. Another task we used large groups of prefrosh to do efficiently was building and installing the railings. We built two jigs on the ground that made it easy to slot all of the appropriate pieces into place and simply screw everything together all at once. This allowed groups of prefrosh to mass manufacture railings on the ground before installing them on upper floors. With both the railings and crossbracings, we were able to parallelize multiple groups of prefrosh working at the same time to get those tasks done faster.!#@p!#@Enough of the overall frame in place meant we could start focusing on some of the more specific features of this year’s fort. We had our art leads Rory K. ‘25 and Jayna E. ‘27 paint the mural panels for this year on the ground and we raised the boards into place once they were done. The boards between the first and second floor were thick enough to be used as a bouldering wall, and the routesetters used the afternoon before the Eastside Party to mark and bolt in the wall’s holds.!#@p!#@While some of the smaller elements of the fort’s structure were being finalized, I embarked on a sidequest to rig up the net in the center. It took me about 5 hours to rig the net, which was far longer than I thought it would be lol. I wove a continuous strand of webbing through the edges of the net and the u-bolts installed into the fort’s frame and tied the webbing into a closed loop with a tensioning hitch. Because the net was brand new, though I tensioned it tightly as I put it up, after a hundred people sat in it over the course of a week it sagged a lot more than I intended. Hopefully if this net is used for future forts that stretch will be accounted for already and it’ll better maintain its tension over the course of the week.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-7-redo-1000x1320.png]!#@The final step for the fort’s visual appearance on the day of the party is for the lighting team to put up the projects they have been working on over the course of the spring and summer. While lighting and general themed decorations went up, the DJ equipment was set up on the third floor. Eventually, we opened the fort up for the Eastside Party and everything was all perfect and amazing for the entirety of REX.⁠11!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-8-1000x1002.png]!#@P.S. Every year we also have small builds⁠12 that are designed and carried out by separate small build leads. This year we had a treehouse with a dome on top of it designed by Jordan T. ‘25 and Hanu S. ‘26, a space trainer ride built by George J. ‘27 and Pablo H. ‘27, and a substance wrestling pit⁠13 led by Gage L. ‘26.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-9.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-10-1000x753.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-1-redo-1000x776.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-2-redo-1000x624.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-4-redo-1000x596.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-5-redo-1000x751.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-6-redo-1000x563.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-7-redo-1000x1320.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-8-1000x1002.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-9.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image-10-1000x753.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-how-to-build-a-three-story-fort/
a lesson in the feminine arts by Aiden H. '28,aka mfa boston and a rant on enjoying art,by Aiden H. '28,"September 30, 2024","Last year when deciding which colleges I wanted to apply to, I had one priority over all else: living on a coast. I’m sorry all states from Utah to Virginia, but there was no way I could go four years without at least an ocean to walk to and ponder my melodramatic nature over.!#@p!#@And while MIT fit the criteria of being a) on a coast and b) VERY close to a body of water⁠01 , the only things I knew about Boston before moving here were about the Celtics, the Boston Tea Party, and the accent. Growing up, I just had no preconceptions of what Boston was like how L.A. and New York have such distinguished vibes.!#@p!#@This is a tragedy. Having been here for only 38 days, I can confidently rank Boston higher on my list than other cities I’ve been to and have been eager to get off campus and actually go explore the city I live in. One of my first ~outings~ was when I took a blue bike⁠02 down to Northeastern’s campus alone one Sunday to explore the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (MFA Boston). I found a museum-themed Spotify playlist and began to walk around alone to the soft pattering of classical music, and loved it!!#@p!#@So in an effort to encourage you to go around Boston (or just outside generally), here are my highlights from my trip and all the things it made me feel.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@DALI: DISRUPTION AND EVOLUTION!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-2139754229-e1727737579168-400x518.jpg]!#@The museum has a huge Dali exhibit right now until December 1, and even though I only got a photo of one painting, this was intentional to spark your curiosity about what could be. Just like with Dali and surrealism in general, I feel like the off-putting nature and seemingly no answers kinda pulls you in?!#@p!#@To combat this lack-of-answers in Dali’s content (at least, at first glances), the exhibit does a really good job of pacing the paintings and providing descriptions of how his life and the surrealist movement are shown in the works, helping to piece together whatever it means.!#@p!#@The exhibit ends with a quote that I felt like accurately represented the whole experience: “My audience mustn’t know whether I am spoofing or being serious; and likewise I mustn’t know either. Where does the deep and philosophically valid Dali being, and where does the bizarre and preposterous Dali end?” This kinda duality of man has been a constant throughout art history, but I feel like recently it has resurged into our young minds (albeit, in a slightly meme-ier way). Am I cottage core or dark academia? Should I cosplay as Brat or an Ultraviolence-era Lana Del Rey sad girl today? Am I secretly a gym bro? If I am a gym bro, when am I an academic gym bro compared to the stereotypical dumb guy? Can I write a blog post about serious art while making a stupid meta joke about the art itself? More importantly, how can my inherent stupidness and seriousness coexist in a way that doesn’t diminish the other?!#@p!#@MONET!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-99624995-800x1422.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-649665524-e1727666541738-800x1049.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-886605336-e1727734159151-800x385.jpg]!#@Monet is my favorite painter of all time (I would decorate my entire house with just him if it wasn’t tacky), so it was unsurprising that I went into the Monet room for too long and just stared. My favorite part is that it is just…pretty? It’s not didactic, it’s not “intellectual”, there’s nothing to do except appreciate it for how good it looks.!#@p!#@I haven’t seen these editions of the Rouen Cathedrals before⁠03 , so it was cool to check more off my list.!#@p!#@Nothing crazy, just my pretty favs.!#@p!#@ART OF ANCIENT EGYPT, NUBIA, AND THE NEAR EAST!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-796507569-400x711.jpg]!#@This section of the museum has a lot of mummies/graves/caskets/tombs scattered throughout. I don’t include any photos here to a) encourage you further to go see them, and b) because I find it weird to take photos of a piece that is meant to represent the life and legacy of an actual living person. Walking through this part of the museum gave me the same overwhelming feeling of walking through a cemetery. It’s easy to walk past each piece and notice how wow! they look exactly like we were taught in elementary school!, but it can be both extremely emotional and important to walk through and understand the weight of the art around you and how it is meant to represent the lives of entire people we’ll never get to know through anything except these (essentially) decorative rocks.!#@p!#@10/10!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@Over the years, my friends and I have developed a running joke about the importance of the “feminine arts”. With the meteoric rise of Pride and Prejudice (2005), Bridgerton, cottage core, and everything of the like into Gen-Z’s minds, we’ve romanticized what was the almost-definitely-awful lifestyle of the 1800s British. Why worry about Instagram or your finances when you could speak French and have tea outside in white linen clothes?⁠04!#@p!#@My Sunday at MFABoston definitely fulfilled the museum-aesthetic that I have been vying for. But while these leisures of “high society” can be fun to gawk over with others, everything mildly fancy feels like a competition. I simultaneously must prove my taste is high-class while disproving yours. We commodify art as a means to prove our worth to others, when really we are just organs with opinions who didn’t make the art in the first place. With such a vast extent of art and culture to be “known” at the museum, even writing this blog post is a daunting exercise in how to talk about and describe art in a way that is purposeful but not esoteric.!#@p!#@This is why I think being in the museum environment, or really anywhere in public alone, can be a really vital experience. And, shockingly, being alone in a museum isn’t difficult! (gasp!) I feel like there’s not much to say past “I like this one” or “what is that?” or “aiden stop trying to touch stuff or we’re gonna get kicked out”. Whether it stems from this internal idea that museums are elegant and you must be an intellectual to enjoy true art or just the societal pressure to make small talk in quiet rooms, the conversation is distracting from the actual purpose you could extract from walking around alone. Turns out, art is a lot harder-hitting when you’re forced to just sit there and think about it.!#@p!#@So go sit there alone and think about it.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-2139754229-e1727737579168-400x518.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-99624995-800x1422.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-649665524-e1727666541738-800x1049.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-886605336-e1727734159151-800x385.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Snapchat-796507569-400x711.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-lesson-in-the-feminine-arts/

turning back time by Ellie F. '28,now your clock can follow the right hand rule!,by Ellie F. '28,"September 27, 2024","I spent this past summer⁠01 at Canada/USA Mathcamp, where I lived five weeks in Tacoma, Washington doing some math and a lot of camp. Mickey Mouse™ won’t tell you this, but Mathcamp actually beats Disney as the most magical place on Earth.!#@p!#@With a name like Mathcamp, you’d assume we do a lot of math. And you’re not wrong. But everyone can choose exactly how much and what type of math they do, and as a serious and dignified mathematician myself, I’ve learned to solve quadratics with origami, use the Axiom of Choice to win infinite games against evil kings⁠02 , make mathy sculptures and embroidery, and become a master at advanced chickenology.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/straws-thingy-800x928.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/embroids-800x980.png]!#@But we do a lot more than just math (gasp!). Let me tell you a story.!#@p!#@One normal day, after my second class, I was very hungry and walking to the cafeteria. Suddenly, I was struck by divine inspiration, as does often happen when I am hungry and near cafeterias. Don’t believe me? I have proof.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bona-fide-bonified-chicken-800x606.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/oooo-canada-2-800x577.png]!#@On this day, I was wondering why clocks go the wrong way. I mean, any real mathematician knows that counterclockwise is the positive direction, right? I immediately decided it was too difficult a task to actually reverse the clock, but I did have another brilliant plan. I’ve outlined it in this image:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/clock-1000x1966.png]!#@The actual product was much cleaner. After we journeyed 40 minutes (and broke and superglued one shoe) to buy the clock from Walmart⁠03 , we decided to disassemble it and get our hands on the clock’s internal organs with all the confidence of an improv artist pretending to be a surgeon.!#@p!#@Turns out, the clock has a permanent magnet that, when reversed, makes it perfectly counterclockwise. Rejoice! The next day, I created a custom face for the clock, one that started with 0 on the x-axis and went in the counterclockwise direction. We hung it up in the main lounge for the world to see, and a few days later, our work caught the notice of Eric, one of the camp directors. He proposed to us a business venture.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/counterclock-1-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/clock-guts-800x1063.png]!#@Every year, Mathcampers can order shirts, and some years, money may also be exchanged for other goods and services, such as frisbees or bucket hats. What if this year, we sold special Mathcamp 2024 Counterclocks? We jumped at the offer, even though it would cost dearly in our own labor. To advertise our product, we wrote a live infomercial to present in front of the entire camp.!#@p!#@In all, over 120 clocks were ordered. In fact, demand was so high that we bought out the entire supply of red clocks from the nearest Walmart, prompting the Counterclock Cabal to have no choice but to ransack all the other Walmarts nearby. But just buying the clocks was the easiest part.!#@p!#@Now, we actually had to make the clock. We sent out a call for help by posting on the schedule board⁠04 , and when it was time, a dozen Mathcampers descended upon the crafts lounge like vultures hungry for unpaid labor.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/eric-sign-4-800x561.png]!#@We started by cutting out 8-inch diameter custom clock faces and cardstock. By the time we were done, we had piles and piles of hand-cut confetti. Then came the reversing itself. Eric had optimized every step of the process, down to the last screw. We even created a playlist featuring songs like “I’ve Had the Time of my Life,” “Time after Time,” and “Rock Around the Clock.” The first session ended up reversing 82 clocks, and after the second session, we had boxes and boxes filled with 128 certified Mathcamp Counterclocks.!#@p!#@I was blown away by the support and enthusiasm for the counterclocks, that a stupid idea I had one day could become actual, paid-for items in dozens and dozens of households. This is what I love about Mathcamp—any silly, strange, or otherwise unrealistic idea or event or project is not only allowed but actively encouraged and loved. That’s what let us enforce curfew on staff with Nerf guns and alarm the rest of campus by descending upon the dining hall like a flamboyance of flamingos. That’s why we made liquid nitrogen ice cream every week and went star tripping, staring at the sky and spinning until we fell down onto the wet grass. That’s how I got a fifth of Mathcamp to dress up as wizards and ended up running through Seattle trying to go to as many Starbucks as I could in 30 minutes.!#@p!#@Mathcamp’s spirit makes me want to dream more, and to actually do and create the things I dream about. My Counterclock now ticks away in my dorm room, sitting with the Kermit puppet I made and performed with at Mathcamp cabaret, and the Boeing 787 model I bought at the Boeing factory field trip. Maybe it can’t actually reverse time and take me back to last summer, but it reminds me that this magic exists independently of camp, and that it’s something that I can seek out and create and grow here at MIT.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/straws-thingy-800x928.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/embroids-800x980.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bona-fide-bonified-chicken-800x606.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/oooo-canada-2-800x577.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/clock-1000x1966.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/counterclock-1-800x450.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/clock-guts-800x1063.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/eric-sign-4-800x561.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/turning-back-time/
I Don’t Know by Emiko P. '25,where am i going to be a year from now?,by Emiko P. '25,"September 27, 2024","I don’t know where I’m going to be a year from now.!#@p!#@That’s never really happened to me before. Preschool through college, it was kind of obvious that, duh, I’d be going to school next year. Maybe the only other time that would be comparable to what I’m feeling now would be when I was a senior in high school trying to figure out which college I would be going to. But still – at least I knew I’d be going to school somewhere.!#@p!#@As an undergrad senior who isn’t applying to grad school (yet) and has no concrete future plans hammered down, this feels different. The pretty much linear direction of my life⁠01 has kind of exploded into a thousand different directions. Usually, I can think one year into the future, and there’s a fuzzy semblance of what my life will look like.!#@p!#@Yet, right now as I sit and type this, I look a year into the future, and it’s a crystalline, pure nothing. Or maybe – better put – it’s a crystalline, pure anything.!#@p!#@A year from now, I could be:!#@p!#@The possibilities are endless, and what’s truly crazy is that any of these alternate realities really could be me in a year. And as I continue this whole process of thinking about life post-grad, it’s unexpectedly led to a lot of internal reflection.!#@p!#@I got lunch with a high school friend recently back in St. Louis, and she asked me something that really stuck with me: “Emi, if you stripped away every external expectation – your family, money, society, your sense of obligation – what would you be left with?”!#@p!#@Without the expectation of earning a gargantuan amount of money, maintaining a stable and healthy work life balance, snagging a cool job to impress everyone – who am I, and what do I want? It only took a few moments of thinking about this before I felt an intense sort of clarity.!#@p!#@I want to read books, creatively write, explore outer space, nurture the next generation, solve, create, imagine… Something in my body literally feels lighter when I dream of these things – as if a part of my soul has become sparkling and buoyant. I want to find that feeling on whatever of the one thousand roads ahead I take.!#@p!#@Something interesting that I’ve noticed is that I often write in other blogs about things that have already happened – classes and internships and soccer games – where everything has been tied up in a nice bow. Well, this blog is different. This is my official statement saying that I do not know yet.!#@p!#@I’m optimistic about this uncertainty, though, because with big changes and leaps of faith come unexpected and precious rewards. MIT is a perfect example. The night before my parents were going to move me in my freshman year, I sat on the brick steps of a restaurant on Newbury Street in Boston and loudly cried and sniveled for what felt like 30 minutes, because “I don’t know anyone here! I just want to go home.” Now, three years later, a part of me can’t bear to leave.!#@p!#@It’s so funny how that works – when something you fear turns into something you can’t imagine you ever lived without. I’m kind of writing this as a reminder to myself and any others out there that even though the future is scary, once we venture into the unknown, what we find there may not be so scary after all.!#@p!#@This all being said, one year is a long time from now. For now, with two more semesters left, I’m looking forward to learning as much as I can about everything from satellites to Japanese literature to product design; having fun playing a sport where we kick an inflated synthetic leather ball around a field for 90 minutes; promising my roommates we will go to sleep early;⁠02  and trying to set a record with my friends for most soup dumplings consumed at Dumpling House ever!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-dont-know/
"In the Music Cubes, no one can hear you scream… by Andi Q. '25",,by Andi Q. '25,"September 25, 2024","… which just goes to show what a great job the acoustics engineers did on soundproofing the building! I got to experience it first-hand last week, and it was pretty mindblowing.!#@p!#@That’s right – the Music Cubes ( otherwise⁠01 known as Building W18 or the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building) are finally open! For those of you unfamiliar with the Music Cubes, they consist of three cube-shaped buildings arranged at odd angles between Kresge Auditorium⁠02 and the sports fields⁠03 , and form MIT’s new music hub. They’ve been under construction since I started at MIT, and I’d often wonder what secrets those mysterious 90%-windowless cubes would hold. (Perhaps a prison for music students who played one too many wrong notes during a rehearsal? Or maybe they’re giant versions of Minecraft note blocks?) Like much of MIT’s brutalist architecture, the exterior doesn’t exactly scream “art is created inside this space,” but after three long years, I can confirm that art is indeed created inside the Music Cubes.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/music-cubes-800x600.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cubes-800x410.png]!#@The Music & Culture Space is the smallest cube and the one I know the least about. As far as I can tell, it’s just one massive room that takes up the entire building. That room currently serves as the rehearsal space for Rambax (MIT’s Senegalese drum ensemble) and Galak Tika (MIT’s Balinese gamelan ensemble); I think it’ll also become a dance studio soon.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/music-culture-bldg-800x600.png]!#@The room is apparently also a small performance space (Galak Tika already has a concert scheduled there). Though I’m not entirely sure how that would work because there are no chairs inside, and you must remove your shoes before entering.!#@p!#@The Music Maker Building is the tallest cube and houses rehearsal rooms, offices, recording studios, a classroom, and even a makerspace! As such, it is also the only cube with windows. (Although the placement of those windows leaves much to be desired.)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4424-800x600.jpg]!#@However, I think there’s a practical reason why there are so few windows – they’re just much harder to soundproof than solid walls, especially when even the solid walls require more than a foot of insulating material. As a result of this design choice, the soundproofing inside the Music Maker Building’s rehearsal rooms is insanely good. You really should go inside and experience it yourself to hear just how good it is, but to give you an idea, two musicians can play in adjacent rehearsal rooms and not hear each other at all. (Even with the door open, the sound you can hear in the hallway is quite muffled.)!#@p!#@But that’s not all these rehearsal rooms have to offer! Each one also has an array of microphones built in, which allow us to make high-quality studio recordings at the click of a button without worrying about setting up all the equipment.!#@p!#@Anyway, this building’s theme is music technology (hence the high-tech rehearsal rooms). The makerspace is equipped with electronics for tinkering with digital musical instruments, and FaMLE (MIT’s laptop ensemble) sometimes rehearses here.!#@p!#@Finally, the Performance Lab is the crown jewel of the Music Cubes – a brand-new concert hall modeled after the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin. Although it is not as big as Kresge (which seats almost twice as many people), it’s better suited for smaller ensembles, especially with its unusual layout where the audience completely surrounds the performers.!#@p!#@The Performance Lab is still under construction and will only open near the end of the semester, but it will be just in time for the MIT Wind Ensemble’s last rehearsal before winter break!!#@p!#@On a tangentially related note, the MIT Wind Ensemble is having an “open rehearsal” next Monday 9/30! If you’re an MIT student who wants to learn more about music performance at MIT ( and also preferably plays the bassoon⁠04 ), come to Kresge at 8:15-ish to sit in the audience, on stage with us, or even play along!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/music-cubes-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cubes-800x410.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/music-culture-bldg-800x600.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4424-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-the-music-cubes-no-one-can-hear-you-scream/
必须好 – pt. 1 by Jessica Z. '27,just keep swimming,by Jessica Z. '27,"September 23, 2024","additional context: hello! the writing below was my first ever attempt at blogging—funnily enough, i only started this writing to apply to be a blogger. while i read it now and see many things i would change,⁠01 i think i generally did an okay job representing my feelings, and i’d like to keep it in a more authentic state (even if i cringe reading it now).!#@p!#@i remembered this draft’s existence when i found myself writing a similar-ish blog last week. i thought it’d be interesting to post this now—nearly one year later—and post a part 2 later reflecting on how MIT has both changed and not changed my perspective.!#@p!#@I am an angry crier. In high school, I stared blankly at a wall whenever I was hit with a wave of sadness. But when I felt a bubbling feeling of frustration build in my chest, I knew that a rush of tears would soon follow.!#@p!#@I went through a rush of angry tears last Friday.!#@p!#@Rising Waters!#@p!#@I spent Friday morning and early afternoon helping my friends move into their new apartment. I drove home at 3:03pm and made a mental plan of everything I wanted to do for the rest of the day in the spirit of productivity. If you know me personally, I am a notes app lover; I spent the next few minutes typing out a personal schedule for myself and started working on my first task.!#@p!#@Roughly forty minutes later, my phone exploded with an onslaught of notifications from my parents alerting me that the restaurant was busy. For some background, my parents immigrated to America and opened a small Chinese restaurant back in 2003. There’s a deep history to Americanized Chinese food,⁠02 but in short, it’s a common business practice for Chinese immigrants to open small restaurants in America. In an all-too-familiar rhythm, I threw on my working clothes, chucked on my shoes, and went downstairs into the restaurant.!#@p!#@Working in the restaurant isn’t light work. It’s surprisingly physically demanding, and it’s not exactly glamorous sprinting back and forth between the kitchen and dining area. I walked back upstairs roughly six hours later at 10:23pm.!#@p!#@Entering my room, I took a look at my planned schedule, the unchecked boxes on my to-do list, and the stationary scattered on my desk from my unfinished first task. I felt my body tense, and my nose began to twinge with heat. A bubbling pit of frustration in my chest began to build, and soon enough, the tears started to fall.!#@p!#@Going Under!#@p!#@My relationship with the restaurant is complicated. It’s my family, my culture, my identity, and admitting I harbor any feelings of resentment towards it makes me feel like I’m giving up on all those core aspects of my life. At the same time, however, it’s undeniable how much time it takes away from my life compared to other students.!#@p!#@For as long as I can remember, one of my deepest insecurities has been falling behind academically. Part of this is rooted in imposter syndrome, but it’s also rooted in knowing the long hours I spend in the restaurant are hours that I could have spent developing technical skills that would make me feel more confident entering college. It was easy to feel more “ahead” in middle school simply because I didn’t understand the vastness of the world, but my fear deepened as I grew older. Once the initial euphoria of getting into college wore off, my sinking fear of being unable to catch up returned. No, I didn’t take AP Calculus at 14, publish a paper at 15, patent a product at 16, present at a conference at 17…the list goes on. I always wonder what I could have become with more free time. I worry that, because of my family responsibilities, I missed a critical time in my youth where I could have molded myself to understand more, learn more, be more.!#@p!#@I know that this is an unfair mindset and not entirely true. I’ve done meaningful work throughout high school that I’m proud of, including being able to support my parents. But it’s hard to tell myself that when I see people my age or younger completing internships at well-known companies or conducting professional research in laboratories.⁠03!#@p!#@It’s also not to say I don’t appreciate the restaurant or my parents—they’re the reason I have the opportunities I do today. It doesn’t escape me that I’ve been given an opportunity my parents were never afforded—I’m incredibly lucky. But it’s on days like today where I feel an unmistakable sense of jealousy for other people who don’t constantly have to be on standby. Who don’t have to put their priorities on the backburner for sudden schedule changes. Who don’t have to finish their homework between long phone calls and bustling customers.!#@p!#@When I think about it for too long, the ache in my chest deepens, and it feels like I am choking. I become a worse version of myself: envious, spiteful, childish.!#@p!#@Catching my Breath!#@p!#@I was able to think more clearly after about a half an hour of angry tears. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit how upset I was, but I think crying it out is sometimes necessary. Even after years of working chaotically in the restaurant and experiencing similar emotions, I haven’t found a fool-proof way to combat them. However, I have practiced some healthy ways to cope with these unpleasant feelings and ground myself from spiraling.!#@p!#@One of those ways is to remember how the restaurant has helped me, even if unconventionally. When I become upset, I childishly tell myself that the time I lost to the restaurant is wasted time. But, I know that this isn’t true. It’s not the time I planned to spend, but it’s certainly not time that I wasted doing nothing.!#@p!#@While preparing food every day doesn’t initially seem academically beneficial, it’s true that it’s taught me the importance of consistent work. The same way that speaking to disgruntled customers makes me want to scream, but it has also taught me the value of communication and conflict resolution. Instead of feeling annoyed at being suddenly called to work, I tell myself I am learning to be adaptable. Yes, sometimes I feel like I’m drowning and can’t catch my breath, but eventually, those feelings begin to fade.!#@p!#@Learning to Swim!#@p!#@When I think about my earlier angry tears, I can’t tell where my anger is directed. I’m not angry at the restaurant. I’m not angry at my parents. I’m not angry at myself. Maybe there’s a thinly blurred line between anger and general frustration. Or maybe I’m more upset that I have no one to blame.!#@p!#@There’s a Chinese phrase, 必须好 (bìxū hǎo), that directly translates to “must be good.” In lieu of accurate direct Chinese-to-English translation, the saying basically means that life moves on because it has to move on.!#@p!#@The boxes on my to-do list are unchecked, but they will get done simply because they have to get done. And not having everything done today won’t create a setback so strong that I’m unable to catch up. It’s not that I’m not trying—it’s that life simply gets in the way sometimes, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that my time spent on another task is automatically useless because it’s not what I originally planned.!#@p!#@The next four years at MIT are going to be filled with a much larger and diverse community than I know now. There will be people who are, objectively, ahead of me academically—I’ve never coded more than ten lines in Python, presented at a major conference, or taken an engineering class, even as a prospective engineering major. I fear being the only person in a PSET study group that just doesn’t understand. My fear of falling behind and not understanding is simply something I will have to get used to because it will happen in college. At the same time, though, I have to keep reminding myself I have other skills I can bring, and I’m at college to learn.!#@p!#@In other words, you just have to keep swimming.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/%e5%bf%85%e9%a1%bb%e5%a5%bd-pt-1/
The Secret Lives of Machines 🤖 by Fiona L. '27,In which the machines in my life get the spotlight they deserve.,by Fiona L. '27,"September 22, 2024","I primarily use my iPad, SLP-F9FD20PWLMX0 to take notes during class. SLP is a tough, no nonsense master of productivity, with a work ethic I admire greatly. Offering me free academic tools and nothing more, SLP protested greatly when my friend tried to download Genshin Impact on them, and when I used their Apple Pencil to draw the Among Us version of Massachusetts.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.53.36-PM-400x292.png]!#@Deep down, I think SLP believes in my ability to improve, despite my chronic inability to focus on my psets and my tendency to use their Apple Pencil for goofy doodles.!#@p!#@Imagine how much resentment you would feel if you learned your parents dropped you on the head as a baby. Now picture that resentment, times a thousand. That’s probably the amount of hate that my phone feels for me. Marla is the phone I got before freshman year of high school, and who I continued to use (and drop) for the next five years. The hall of fame of places where I have dropped Marla: the floor of an aquarium bathroom, a plate of chickpeas, the parking lot of an In-N-Out. If Marla were a person and not an inanimate object, I think I probably would’ve been strangled alive by now. I imagine she was a kind, gentle soul once. But after feeling my dirty fingers on the daily and wearing cheap phone cases and having her storage pushed to the limit⁠01 , she’s become bitter with rage, her electric dreams filled with vengeance.!#@p!#@She finally snapped a few weeks ago. While in Yerevan, Armenia for my MISTI⁠02 internship, I participated in Vardavar, a festival where everybody–men and women, young and old alike–splash water on each other as a form of blessing. I got soaked–and so did Marla! In one last act of rebellion, she started restarting at random times, and her display constantly scrolled up like the reels of a slot machine. She was rendered completely unusable. Thankfully, after a panicked email, I received money from MIT-Eurasia to fix Marla. Khachatur, an MIT Physics Phd from Armenia, and also our MISTI-Armenia program ambassador, recommended Pixel, a repair shop in the heart of Yerevan. I took the bus from my AirBnB in the hills, walked into the store, and waited. Part of me didn’t think Marla could ever be fixed. But another part of me held out hope that my relationship with Marla (and her screen) could finally take a turn for the better.!#@p!#@“My phone’s broken,” I said to the clerk when it was my time to be helped, “I think it’s water damage.”!#@p!#@“Well, it’s definitely damaged,” he replied, unamused. He motioned for me to follow him down a flight of stairs.!#@p!#@I descended into what can only be called an “EE Chamber.” A man hunched over a desk, where he worked to fix a phone with a screwdriver, its internal machinery scandalously exposed. His work was illuminated by a skinny desk lamp, and various wires and electrical parts were strewn across the desk. Behind him was a wall of semi-opaque cabinets of phone parts and other electrical equipment. I asked him how much the repairs would cost, and told him that I would check out the other repair stores in the area before coming back. But those were empty words–the choice had already been made. The moment I laid my eyes on the EE Chamber, I knew that that was no better place for Marla to be fixed.!#@p!#@In just one and a half hours, and for just $64, I came back to a healthy, working Marla, with an unbroken screen. I wanted to jump and scream in joy, relieved that I wouldn’t have to settle for a cheap burner phone, or spend the rest of my MISTI experience without data.!#@p!#@The next day, I ventured into an underground mall to buy a screen protector for Marla, determined not to fall prey to my old mistakes⁠03 .!#@p!#@I think my relationship with Marla is improving. Yes, I’m still the same clumsy person I was before. But I genuinely try to care for her more, to make sure she doesn’t fly out of my hands or careen out of my comically small pockets⁠04 . I know 5 years of constant physical (and emotional) pain is a lot to get over, but to me, it’s worth it to try to overcome.!#@p!#@In my freshman fall, I was unfortunate enough to end up in a triple on the tenth floor⁠05 of Simmons. I was mildly dehydrated during the first few weeks of college simply because I was too lazy to go all the way down to the first floor, fill up my water, and then go all the way back up to the tenth. That’s where The Faucet came in. Ever kind and ever gracious, The Faucet was built atop a defunct minifridge by my Course 2 neighbor. Its creation left me with a deep seated desire to defect from Course 6 that still remains in my soul. The Faucet is friendly and sociable, always willing to give more, to help those in their times of distress. He’s the type of friend to buy you a tub of ice cream after a bad breakup, or to binge entire seasons of a show he doesn’t like, just because you wanted to watch it with him. Whether it be my dehydrated freshman self, or my Connor 2 friend using water balloons to fight back against upperclassman hazing, The Faucet continues to provide us with refreshing, cool, water. I only hope The Faucet takes a bit more time for himself.!#@p!#@Jacques loves adventures. Whether those adventures are learning the guitar over quarantine, earning an MIT pirate certificate, or exploring a decrepit cabin in the woods, Jacques is here for it. As a flashlight, Jacques knows he’s especially suited for those late night strolls and those Things He’s Not Allowed To Be Doing. I don’t think he’s happy that I brought him to MIT “just in case” and I haven’t used him a single time. Especially with Marla’s flashlight, he hasn’t been able to join in on any midnight walks, 3am snack runs, or even a nocturnal trip to The Faucet to refill my water bottle. He simply sits on a cabinet in my dorm room, dreaming about the adventures we could’ve gone on together. One day, I hope Jacques’ wish can finally come true.!#@p!#@My parents used an extra $2,000 in outside scholarship funds to purchase Edward⁠06 , a Macbook for me to use during college. Edward became a nervous machine after joining my Apple Ecosystem and hearing Marla’s tales of violence and abuse. But to be fair, the worst Edward has experienced is a bunch of cutesy stickers stuck onto his back, which have since faded with age.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.53.45-PM-400x314.png]!#@Yes, there have been moments where I have ALMOST dropped Edward, don’t get me wrong. But I’ve caught him in all of those instances. And I got Edward a nice Magic Mouse⁠07 as well. I don’t think Edward should have any HR complaints to file against me–not that he would actually file them if he did, he’s the type of machine to try and fly under the radar, performing his duties adequately and not trying to attract any attention⁠08 .!#@p!#@Whether I’m taking 2 hours to watch a 45 minute lecture video or unironically typing “edgy nightcore music” into the Youtube search bar, Pauline doesn’t judge. She is the trusty set of headphones that my mom got me in my sophomore year of high school, who I started to appreciate more once I started living with roommates. Pauline is apathetic, and a little bit jaded. Whether that’s due to my mildly cursed listening history, or whether that’s just the way that she was born⁠09 , I’m just thankful that she doesn’t judge, like a cashier who scans your nine packs of salami⁠10 without batting an eye. Unfortunately, though Pauline’s got the best internet tea and the best songs, I’ve never really learned much about her. She doesn’t tell me about herself often, though I’m certain she’s got some interesting things to say.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.54.27-PM-400x429.png]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.53.36-PM-400x292.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.53.45-PM-400x314.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-5.54.27-PM-400x429.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-secret-lives-of-machines-%f0%9f%a4%96/
"get SLAPped! by Mel N. '24, MEng '25",it doesn't hurt,"by Mel N. '24, MEng '25","September 21, 2024","last year, i got an email from sandy, the head of house at east campus. my tenure as a physical resident of ec had just ended due to the initiation of a two-year renovation plan, but house team was still emailing us from time to time about events, dining hall swipes, free covid tests, and cool opportunities around campus. this email was in the last category, and i’ve unfortunately since deleted it,⁠01 but it was telling us two key things:!#@p!#@1. we can get free art from mit for our living spaces, and!#@p!#@2. the free art is REALLY GOOD.!#@p!#@the program is called SLAP, which stands for the student lending art program, and i suspect they chose the name at least partially for the sake of an amusing acronym. at the beginning of every academic year, the mit list visual arts center offers a lottery to all students (grad or undergrad) for a chance to pick out a piece from their collection that they can hang up in their room or common area. if you’re selected, you pick a time to visit the gallery and claim an artwork.!#@p!#@it’s a bit competitive — art goes on a first-come, first-serve basis, and there are a few that get snatched up right away.!#@p!#@i think i was still half-asleep from getting up too early while i was looking through their collection last year, which consists of mostly original prints and photography, when suddenly:!#@p!#@THEY HAVE A JENNY HOLZER PIECE?????????!#@p!#@(i spent a considerable amount of time in my formative years reblogging art and poetry on tumblr, and jenny holzer was always a big hit among my mutuals.)!#@p!#@now wide awake, i clicked through the rest of their collection and spotted yoshitomo nara works, along with some really beautiful photographs by doc edgerton.!#@p!#@i made a list of pieces i wanted before i went into the gallery so that i could find them more quickly. i left with a painting by ria brodell that seemed to be part of a series called butch heroes. looking it up, i found that brodell, a boston-based artist, had actually written a book by the same name with more paintings and texts about queer historical figures:!#@p!#@helen oliver aka john oliver hung in my room for all of senior year, complementing the greens and whites and browns of my bedding and furniture.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/l.2022.004_brodell.jpg-1000x1763.webp]!#@this year, i signed up again (thanks to another one of sandy’s reminders) and was lucky enough to be chosen. my appointment was actually scheduled on the day of the mid-autumn festival, so when i popped into my lab’s office to say hi and check in with my pi, a postdoc offered me a mooncake,⁠02 which made me very happy. i took this as a good sign.!#@p!#@and it was, because when i went into the gallery, i found one of the yoshitomo nara pieces i had picked out still hanging on the wall. i was almost shaking as i took it off the hanger. it’s a print, not the original, otherwise i wouldn’t even want to breathe on it — but it’s still SO COOL. i brought it to the entrance to fill out paperwork and chatted about it with the people there.!#@p!#@(“good find! it’s a little creepy though, so make sure you can still sleep at night.”)!#@p!#@there’s something mesmerizing about the contrast between thick and thin lines here, as well as the waves meshing in with the figure’s hair, and the story it’s telling about gender. getting to look at this painting up close in my room and noticing all the little details is…really special.!#@p!#@if you’ll still be at mit next year, sign up for the lottery!! the list center has such an incredible collection. whatever you find is going to add a lot of character to your room. get SLAPped!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/l.2022.004_brodell.jpg-1000x1763.webp,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/get-slapped/

I got all excited with the new semester and joined some new clubs, but didn’t drop any clubs from last year, so now I’m kind of overbooked, but this is entirely of my own doing. I have a ton of blog posts that are half-written and I need to work on/post soon. These young’ens are showing me up!!#@p!#@Anyways, today⁠01  was the WMBRBQ!!#@p!#@WMBR (Walker Memorial Basement Radio) is MIT’s student college radio station. It’s located under Walker Memorial building (duh) and it’s a full radio station! I love music so so so much, and being part of this station is one of my favorite things about MIT. Today we had a barbecue (the WMBRBQ) in the lawn next to Walker, and I signed up to be a photographer! These photos will also go on the WMBR Blog, and on the website, which you should totally go check out!! You can listen to WMBR @ 88.1FM on the radio in the greater Boston area, and @ wmbr.org worldwide!!#@p!#@Me and my roommate have a radio show called Midwest Pizzeria that airs at 7pm on Sunday nights. There’s plenty of other great shows, like Bats in the Belfry, The Hot Rat Sessions, The…, and of course, Porcelain Cow. [Full show schedule with descriptions here!] You can also go back and listen to 2 weeks worth of radio archives, so if you miss something it’s no big deal!!#@p!#@During Covid, a lot of people began doing their shows remotely, and we’re still working on getting the number of live shows back to normal.

things that made me happy lately by Kai V. '25,from the first week of classes,by Kai V. '25,"September 20, 2024","It was the morning of the second or third day of classes and I had brewed jasmine tea at the pika⁠01 kitchen counter and was sipping it while listening in on breakfast conversations. “The curse of this degree is that now I perceive every building I enter really intensely,” said our GRA⁠02 , a PhD student in Course 4 (architecture). “How do you perceive pika?” someone asked. “It’s a little structurally alarming sometimes,” our GRA admitted.!#@p!#@It was early—8 a.m.—so only a few people were awake. People talked in low tones about physical chemistry and the recitations they had to attend or TA. pika gets much louder at night, and since our mealplan is open to anyone we can have upwards of forty people at dinner. But mornings feel cold and quiet and serene.!#@p!#@I moved into pika this fall, which makes me feel almost froshlike. I have a new roommate (hi Uzay), new room, new living group. I hang up all my posters on the brick wall facing my and Uzay’s desks. Every day, it seems, another poster falls, and I stick it back on grimly with another layer of masking tape. When I come home from classes I linger in the CGE⁠03 to strike up conversations with my housemates while they work or snack, about why small modular reactors suck or why we think another housemate gives Virginia vibes or our collective love for soy milk.!#@p!#@It’s sort of how I imagined my freshman year would go. Though my first year here didn’t end up going badly, it also wasn’t at all what I expected. Mostly I felt confused and disoriented—maybe because my prefrontal cortex hadn’t developed yet; maybe because I knew less than I do now about what was available to me at MIT; maybe because I entered college fresh out of the pandemic and it took a few months (or years) to feel like a productive, social creature again.!#@p!#@Whatever the case, things feel simpler now. pika held a zine-making workshop the other night as part of chill week, which is a week filled with events for new people to have an excuse to come over and get to know pika. We ate Trader Joe’s ice cream mochi together and cut out parts of magazines and glued them to folded cardstock. I had just made dinner for everyone, which included this strangely textured orange mushroom that someone had foraged. I was behind on all my work and the semester had barely even started. In some ways this is a simple narrative: friends, food, firehose. That’s what I expected coming in, and it wasn’t until very recently that I found it, but now it’s mine.!#@p!#@A few words about my classes, which are also making me happy. I’m taking:!#@p!#@6.2220 [Power Electronics Laboratory]: This class makes it trivial to manage my time. It takes over 20 hours a week and you can only do the high-voltage work in lab. Thus, I have no choice but to go to lab whenever I can, and when lab is closed I work on my other classes. Of course sitting in lab poking transistors into breadboard sockets for five hours straight is exhausting sometimes, but other times I look at the signals on my oscilloscope screen and think, this is awesome, I could look at oscilloscope signals forever.!#@p!#@18.404 [Theory of Computation]: For a long time I have thought in a non-rigorous way about how humans and machines process information. It’s probably one of the most interesting concepts in the world to me. I think this shows in what I like to write about, too: how things like memory and art and love flow through and are crystallized in our information-processing pipelines.⁠04 Now this class will help me rigorize my thinking, which I am excited for. I know it sounds like wishy-washy mysticism to be tying all these things together but they’re truly very intertwined in my mind.!#@p!#@18.112 [Complex Analysis]: This class is just okay so far. But it motivates me to read my very good complex analysis textbook, so I’m happy with it. The complex plane is quite beautiful!!#@p!#@21G.111 [Chinese Calligraphy]: In this class, we meditate and write pretty Chinese characters for three hours a week. I think handwriting is such an intimate thing—I wish it was more normalized to handwrite and send letters to friends. I keep everything people handwrite for me: a note on the front page of a novel, For Kai, From Amos. Or a years-old birthday card, Happy Birthday, From Joseph. It’s this very beautiful evidence of existence and intention. In particular my best writing is always, always done pen-to-paper. 05 There’s something about feeling your fingers physically form the words that forces an understanding and rhythm that isn’t necessarily there when you type, instead watching your words form impersonally in front of you, in a pre-rendered font with predetermined spacings. Anyway—the point is—I’m so excited to take a whole class dedicated to studying and practicing handwriting closely and deliberately.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_20240917_1652376122-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1_C0yc7e4wVNwYhV4KCzYmkw-800x333.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_20240917_1652376122-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1_C0yc7e4wVNwYhV4KCzYmkw-800x333.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/things-that-made-me-happy-lately/
hokey pokey by Janet G. '27,is the best ice cream in the world (unbiased take),by Janet G. '27,"September 19, 2024","The school year has begun again. I’m glad to report that some things never change: aside from all the frosh complaining about why building 26 is bunched between 12 and 36,⁠01  the massive flurry of dormspams as clubs begin to campaign for energetic frosh labour, there’s also the various ice breakers so that everyone can pretend to be friends with each other in a 30 person class.!#@p!#@The icebreakers that I’ve done this year are somehow more interesting than usual; my anthropology class teacher asked us to say our name and a small story related to our name, and my 6.1210⁠02 TA asked us for our favourite ice cream flavours.!#@p!#@If you ever meet me, one of the first things you will figure out about me is that I’m a Kiwi.⁠03 I’m sure you’ve noticed the spelling that feels slightly off,⁠04  and people do often introduce me as the token New Zealander.⁠05  Throughout my freshman year, I’ve managed to collect a pretty sizeable list of “things that tip people off”.!#@p!#@Some of these items include:!#@p!#@Apparently, ice cream flavours now also belong on this list. My favourite flavour of ice cream is hokey pokey, which is vanilla ice cream dotted with these tiny balls of delicious golden crisp honeycomb toffee. I knew from previous experience that people here had no idea what hokey pokey was, and for once I wanted to be slightly more normal and surely choose a flavour that wasn’t as stand-out-weird. So when the introduction train finally came around to me, I was like, this is my chance. I’ll choose my second favourite flavour.!#@p!#@And that’s when I knew I fucked up. Apparently, Boysenberry is not an American ice cream flavour EITHER?!#@p!#@My childhood was spent running barefoot to the dairy to buy a $2 ice block. I only realised that squirrels were real when I arrived in America. Even the night sky looks different: I’d never seen the Big Dipper before coming to New England. There’s a lot of moments at MIT that remind me of how different this school is from the place where I grew up. This is as exciting as it is daunting; when everything is different, you get the chance to become someone different too.!#@p!#@Maybe this is the point of these icebreakers. Everything is about who you are now and what you will become. What’s your name? Where do you live? What do you want to major in? Who do you want to be? There’s no talk about what you’ve done. MIT is full of a particularly concentrated brand of academic overachiever. You’re not special if you’re smart, incredibly hardworking, or incredibly lazy.⁠09  When academic overachievement is no longer your defining feature, who do you become? I’ve seen friends who chill out and play minecraft until 3am; friends who fell in love with glassblowing and help make the prettiest pumpkins; friends who jump into poker and just earn a lot of money while having fun. My friends who are most assured in themselves are the ones who let themselves explore and try on different identity-forming things.!#@p!#@I’ve explored a bunch too! I did a lot of debating before college, but when I joined I decided that I didn’t want to feed the hyper-competitive part of myself. ⁠10 Instead, I joined clubs that really work towards building things collaboratively, and now I work with many of the coolest people I know in HackMIT. ⁠11 I learned to whittle things down and not try to do 7 extracurriculars at once, to not take on so much responsibility and delegate better. I’m a Kiwi, obviously, and I’m still figuring out that part of my identity; do I want to have it be so emphasised?!#@p!#@I think it’s okay though. My friends know me more than just my labels. They know me as Janet, the one who they made grilled cheese with at 3am, the one who they shopping carted to the 5.111⁠12  final, the one who they pulled an all-nighter psetting with. College is great! It’s really been a chance for me to explore and figure things out, and also to feel enabled to say cheesy shit like “yeah yeah but have you considered the real identity are the friends we made along the way”.!#@p!#@Nice to meet you! I’m Janet. I’ve been thinking about what it means to be a Kiwi, I study CS and biology, and I want to find things I love in the world and highlight them. My favourite ice cream flavour in the world is Hokey Pokey, and you should come try it with me sometime!!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/hokey-pokey/
greta gerwig’s barbie and insecurity by Aiden H. '28,aka moving to college,by Aiden H. '28,"September 19, 2024","As of this weekend, I have watched Greta Gerwig’s 2023 blockbuster Barbie six (6) times. I have also cried to Greta Gerwig’s 2023 blockbuster Barbie five (5) times, almost always multiple times during the movie. Although the “I’m Just Ken” memes and bright pink were shoved down everyone’s throats enough for society to collectively forget about the movie after last fall, my obsession continues.!#@p!#@So when walking back from dinner at New Vassar with my roommate, I was appalled to hear he missed out on the Barbenheimer craze. That same night, we hunkered down in the Maseeh basement media room and watched the movie. He thought it was fine, but I naturally rekindled my love of the movie and feel inclined to revisit it.!#@p!#@Now I know I’m far from the first person to talk about Barbie, and its importance to modern feminist movements is something I cannot comment on nor relate to. Still, like any piece of art, I find it impossible not to pull out my own interpretations and personal connection to the movie–how it perfectly encapsulates my feelings of self-doubt and attitude towards the “real world”. So having revisited the movie in my first month at MIT, the themes were stark and unavoidable reflections on how I’ve been feeling once again.!#@p!#@So here’s the (very long winded) beginning of my college experience, through Barbie.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@“The real world isn’t what I thought it was.” — Barbie!#@p!#@Like a lot of high school students, I spent the majority of my senior year both stressing over and romanticizing college life. After my admission and with a summer countdown in full swing, this romanticization felt tangible. I spent hours watching MIT vlogs on Youtube, researching potential classes I could take, looking at majors I knew I would never pick (mechanical engineering) and comparing dorm options. Soon enough, MIT was the picturesque landscape for the indie movie I convinced myself I was starring in. And for the most part, I would argue these moments have existed for me at MIT.!#@p!#@What I forgot about was everything in between.!#@p!#@In Barbie, it’s unknown where the Kens go when the Barbie’s aren’t around–they merely sit and wait for Barbie to be in a plot relevant enough to need them there, too. In my head, I was yearning for the shiny, fake, and unattainable, too. So the moment I noticed that my life here would not be constant parties, trips to quaint Boston cafes, and doing world-changing research, my perception shattered. MIT, despite all its glory, is also just another place I live now. I’m still sitting in bed doom scrolling on my phone, binge watching sitcoms, and doing homework at my desk. Somehow, I’ll have to swap the idea of MIT for what is actually is–somewhere I love, but not in the ways I expected.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@“I’m not pretty anymore” – Barbie!#@p!#@Just like anything that stays in its environment too long, I grew accustomed to the “role” and personality designated to me. In middle and high school, as pretentious as it sounds, I was always used to being close to the top of my class. After a while, I intentionally strived to maintain that not because I felt a fundamental necessity to, but because I wouldn’t know who I was if I weren’t that guy. It was the shiny box I put myself into not because I wanted to be contained, but because I was hoping people would notice me.!#@p!#@As both everyone could guess and everyone did tell me, I am very far from the most talented person at MIT. And shockingly, I feel like I’m doing very well handling this newfound academic insecurity. Even though I took the high school equivalent of three of my classes this semester, I have already found myself a) lost on campus, b) crying over code, and c) demoralized at my inability to solve problems with the grace or speed of my peers. Suddenly, I was not the person people turned to, but the person begging for help.!#@p!#@My insecurity stems less from not being able to ace every assignment, but from arriving in a new environment where suddenly the starting point to introduce my personality to others is lost.!#@p!#@In high school, I would make jokes with friends that once in college I could completely change who I am–I could speak with a fake accent, dye my hair, and tell everyone I’m distantly related to a famous TikTok star. It turns out that in a weird way, I am being forced to reinvent my personality–to find a point of basic connection outside what classes I’m in or extracurriculars I joined because everyone here is in the same boat. This isn’t to say I think the only aspect of me in high school was my academics; however, it was the only part of me that most people knew.!#@p!#@Stereotypical Barbie is known for being just that: her stereotypical, picture-perfect self. Who are we if not what we are called by others? What happens when we lose the one thing we’ve attached to ourselves to put us apart? What happens when, in the middle of everything we could’ve ever wanted, we don’t feel special anymore?!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@“That’s life. It’s all change.” – Gloria!#@p!#@My beige flag is that I don’t really move on from things, for better or for worse (as proven by my continual use of ‘beige flag’). Like a lot of people, I act like I love to embrace change and go on crazy adventures, and then as soon as I’m confronted with it I become devastatingly nostalgic. At every corner, I look for the opportunity to become pessimistic and prove to myself that my decision for change was stupid and that I should retreat into the life I had.!#@p!#@I got COVID the weekend before classes started (almost definitely from a frat party that wasn’t entirely worth it). With little options, I sat in my room demoralized and as melodramatic as ever waiting out my symptoms. mixed with the two-weeks-since-moving homesickness, it felt as if my decision to embrace change was being tested, like I was being shown I had made the wrong choice.!#@p!#@But what about all the changes I’ve needed, and just decided I wasn’t going to focus on? Walking around Boston is far more entertaining than my street in Colorado, and sitting in classes with the most enthusiastic professors I’ve ever seen has reinvigorated a sense of passion for classwork that senioritis effectively killed.!#@p!#@I have to remember that in 4 years, leaving MIT will be the change I dread, wanting to return to the life I have now.!#@p!#@***!#@p!#@“Even if you can’t make it perfect, you can make it better.” — Sasha!#@p!#@Despite Barbie’s attempts to fix her dreamland after seeing it destroyed by the Kens, Barbie remains notably apathetic and disappointed at the end of the movie. She created the world everyone else wanted, but after seeing through the facade, decided she couldn’t move on blissfully ignorant of what it truly was.!#@p!#@This is a lot of what aging and being a person has felt like–becoming aware of awful shit and doing my best to tolerate it. My family calls this pessimism; to me, it’s my sincerest form of optimism. In being tested in my ability to extract what I can out of situations that inevitably will never meet the expectations I put forth in my head (whether it be for myself or the situation around me), everything begins to level out. The trophies and the punches are equal.!#@p!#@While at MIT, I hope that I don’t treat it as a landscape where my level of perfection is tested, parading myself around to fit into a system I created in my head. I also hope that I find the balance of realism about how life will be and also an innate satisfaction about the beauty of being here.!#@p!#@I guess all I’m trying to say is, I’m still trying to learn that I am Kenough, whoever and wherever I am.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230807_204902-400x393.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230807_204902-400x393.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/greta-gerwigs-barbie-and-insecurity/
"my first year, in slices by Veronica P. '27",ft. ruminations on the freshmen friend group,by Veronica P. '27,"September 18, 2024","“The muscles of my soul, longing for the opportunity to feel and fear and push, know they would otherwise atrophy.”!#@p!#@I wrote this line roughly a month before move-in, in an effort to capture just what it was about the college experience that drew me. Fresh out of high school, with my hometown chapter tied neatly in a bow, I felt- quite honestly- bored. I craved excitement, wanted my life to take the shape of any proper coming-of-age novel: rife with unanticipated twists, huge thrills, daunting challenges, quintessentially adolescent intensity, and, ultimately, growth.!#@p!#@Life doesn’t always work out this way, but, a year later, I can report that I got exactly what I was looking for. Amongst adjacent adventures, I had that “canon event” freshman year friend group experience: the chain of events- more precisely those of the powder keg variety- that unfold when a group of wildly different people, plunging into a wildly different life, cling onto the first people they meet and- seeking some sense of community- see those connections through far longer than they would under any other circumstance.!#@p!#@Do I regret it? No, not at all. For every bridge burned, there were some incredible, genuine connections formed.  Even for those bonds that didn’t last, I’m a firm believer in the notion that people come into your life to teach you something; they aren’t always meant to stay, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing- or anyone’s fault.!#@p!#@Besides, I don’t want to look back on this period of my life and fixate on the soap-opera-ness of it all. Those moments have a tendency to stick regardless, and how can you possibly expect anyone- yourself included- to know exactly how to react whilst confronted with a million changes at once?!#@p!#@At the end of the day, the moments that I’d like to linger on- the moments I want to press gently against my chest and rerun in my mind- were the smaller quirks and joys. Those moments of my first year that made my life feel like a silly little slice-of-life sitcom, blessed with a cast of truly remarkable people.!#@p!#@And one of the best parts about a sitcom is that you can tune in at any moment. So, without further ado, here’s a nonlinear series of glimpses into my freshman year at MIT:!#@p!#@—!#@p!#@Gathered around a circle of delightfully greasy Cambridge Pizza, a figure snaps us out of our post-Halloweekend indulgence.!#@p!#@“Is that my 5.111 TA?”!#@p!#@“No way- he’s dressed like an orbital!!!”!#@p!#@—!#@p!#@9PM.

tunes of interphase! by Angie F. '28,"or, how to leave home and look cool doing it",by Angie F. '28,"September 17, 2024","I didn’t really have a good senior year. My hometown started closing in on me in October, and it would’ve kept doing so until I collapsed under the pressure had I not gotten an MIT acceptance letter in December. I held tight onto the breath of fresh air I took in that day for months, and the effort of it made me blue in the face by March. Sin LiMITe⁠01 and CPW⁠02 rolled around, and I left that sleepless, exhilarating set of weekends with a song stuck in my head–!#@p!#@–and two main things on my mind:!#@p!#@For months, all I’d wanted to do was leave. Now, I had a chance to do so early, and address my main worry about MIT in the process: I hadn’t taken physics since an algebra-based distance learning class during freshman year and didn’t really have a strong hold on chem, either, so I knew I’d have to spend my summer playing catchup. I asked my parents for permission, put my all into my application, and waited, holding my breath once more and only letting go once I got that acceptance letter in my email. I spent the month that followed feeling Puerto Rico turn into something like a waiting room: everything that I loved still stood out, but all the things that I disliked became easier and easier to shrug away. After all, I was going home.!#@p!#@I was still kind of nervous though– as I packed my bags, as I boarded the plane, as I walked to the front door of my dorm and felt Maseeh tower over me. If I didn’t like Interphase, then I wouldn’t be able to call what I was doing “moving out” anymore: instead, I would be running away from all the things that had made my hometown such an unpleasant place to be during my senior year. I’d be letting them win.!#@p!#@But as the people I’d be sharing a floor with for the next seven weeks began to filter into the halls, as I set up my bed and color coordinated my closet and put together my lava lamp, I felt some of these fears begin to subside. Passing by strangers who I knew would soon become friends, I breathed in and out for the first time in what felt like months, and Maseeh became a place that wasn’t quite home yet, but could be.!#@p!#@My time at Interphase turned from one of meek, apprehension-riddled excitement to a vibrant whirlwind of a life, a change that was as sudden and striking as the guitar riff that follows a second of silence at the beginning of this song. It blasted through my headphones during trips through the Infinite to get to class or the Edgerton Center and runs across Killian Court just for the heck of it. I listened to it during conversations about nothing and everything and all that lies in the nerdy in between in the Maseeh 2 lounge, p-set sessions in the basement, and most notably, while walking across the Harvard Bridge with two Interphasers who would go on to become some of my best friends, Carlos and Fabián. Something most people will (unwillingly) come to know about me is that I can do a mean impression of Morrissey, the widely and rightfully disliked lead singer of The Smiths. It’s something that my friends from home have honestly gotten kind of sick of, so I was incredibly surprised to hear Carlos and Fabián’s impressed reactions to me singing along to the chorus of this song. As silly as it was, it filled me with a weird sense of peace: all the things about me that had become commonplace back home were exciting and new here, and I could pick and choose which ones I wanted to leave behind and which I wanted to keep. No one at MIT knew about my Morrissey impression, and I didn’t know about theirs. There were a million things I couldn’t wait to share with everyone I was growing to love here, and even more I couldn’t wait for them to share back. On that bridge, the sun was already beginning to hide itself behind the Boston skyline, but to me, it looked like it was just starting to rise.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0169-400x369.jpeg]!#@One of the first things I learned from upperclassmen at Sin LiMITe was that everyone at MIT will get many grueling but surpassable reality checks during their time there, usually starting in their first semester. And, of course, in typical prefrosh fashion, I nodded along while silently telling myself that it didn’t apply to me. I thought that, by accepting early on that MIT would kick my butt, the effects of the butt-kicking itself would be mitigated. After all, I’d already given myself a reality check: I’d repeated all the classic lines, about how MIT is meant to be hard and half of the people here go from being in the top 10% of their high school class to the bottom 50% of their college one, to myself over and over. Going into Interphase, I expected to struggle with physics and chemistry… but not math. After all, I’d always been good at it: AP Calculus BC was (mostly) a cakewalk, and I managed to test into Interphase’s Calc 3 class despite never having taken multivar. When I got my first p-set, I approached it just as I would’ve in high school, hunkering down over the assignment at my desk the day it was due with nothing but my class notes and my noise-canceling headphones. This went about as well as you’d expect, and as 11:59 PM inched closer and closer, it was my friend Daniel walking into the study room to find me approaching hysterics that stopped me from failing to submit anything at all, though what I had was still not enough to earn me a passing grade. As I uploaded my work to Gradescope, I sobbed to this guy I’d known for barely two weeks about how this was “the worst assignment I’d ever submitted.” He reassured me that, after this, I’d be way ahead of everyone else in 18.02 in the fall, but all I could do was shake my head: in that moment, I didn’t feel like I could ever be ahead of anyone.!#@p!#@This, of course, caught up to me fairly quickly, with my professor reaching out to offer support shortly after the due date. As embarrassed as I initially was, I quickly realized there was no reason to be: he and the TAs were incredibly understanding, and all they wanted to do was help. It took me a while to accept that I needed it, and I worked through another p-set alone, listening to this song whenever I got especially frustrated. But I slowly let it sink in that collaboration was necessary at thrive at MIT, a realization that was easy to have once I started noticing all the things people around me achieved by simply putting aside their pride and leaning on each other, getting twice my results with only half of my struggle: the moment that pushed me to internalize this the most was walking out of the study room angry at myself for not making much progress on a problem on my second p-set, only to find that five of my classmates had been debating that same problem at a board in the lounge for the last hour. I accepted my professor’s offer to have one-on-one office hours with him and a TA twice a week and made an effort to ask for help even when it made me feel silly, both in and out of academic contexts (notable example: the time I looked around HMart for something for somewhere between five and ten minutes before sucking it up and asking an employee about it, only to find that they didn’t have what I was looking for at all). It is, admittedly, a massive work in progress, one I suspect I’ll be grappling with for a good amount of my MIT career, if not longer. However, being able to learn strategies to deal with it early on has been one of the most invaluable benefits of Interphase. I’ve already made more progress on this issue this summer than I had in my entire academic career leading up to it, both because of the support of the program staff and the presence of my peers, from Daniel in the study room to everyone else who showed me that even the smartest people get confused sometimes.!#@p!#@One day in the dining hall, a group of wide-eyed high schoolers came up to the Interphase table, flooding us with questions about essays and stats and application tips. “Do any of you feel like you got in with a mid application?” one of them asked. I raised my hand, and was shocked to see every other person at that table– a table filled with robotics geniuses and cancer researchers and math magicians– do the same. The flip side of the MIT community’s commendable humility is that imposter syndrome is almost a campus-wide epidemic; however, this means that there’s never a shortage of kindness from your peers when the disease reaches you.!#@p!#@A staple of Interphase 2024 is the vibrant party scene… ok, not really. Over the course of the summer, my friends Isa and Carlos took it upon themselves to host three “raves” that all of Interphase agrees were, in short, “a movie.” Prompted by jokes about the behemoth that is the thousand-person Boston Welcome Week Rave in the fall, they put together lights, a sound system, and the best Spotify queue known to man in the Maseeh 2 lounge, bringing the whole cohort (and a few RFAs) together for a night of singing, dancing, and karaoke. As I jumped around singing my heart out to this song, it struck me that none of the things that usually would have mattered to me in a situation like this– whether I knew the lyrics or not, my criminal inability to dance (expect a blog post about my learning experience at the Latin Dance Club at some point), who was or wasn’t watching– were on my mind at all.!#@p!#@Over the course of the summer, I picked up on something a little odd: my laugh had started to change. It started with just my closest friends, but over time, I found the same barely familiar sound coming out of my mouth at every joke or funny story, no matter where I was or who was telling it. It was the sound of someone without a reserved bone in their body, the unrestrained laugh I’d usually kept deep inside me save for the most special occasions. Now, though, I heard it constantly, and it was at one of these raves that I realized with a start why: I didn’t have to hold myself back here. Not only was I happier, I was also just more me. With all the p-sets and late night Cambridge Pizza runs and bellyaching laughing fits taking up my days, I hadn’t found the time to water down the parts of myself I usually made sure to squash meticulously. The deep breaths I’d worked so hard to take on my first day at Interphase were shallow compared to the ones I took every second now, staring right at the person I was becoming and realizing I was excited to see what I’d turn into.!#@p!#@Another thing I realized at one of these raves: I cannot sing for the life of me. But when I was pushed into the middle of a dance circle during “Creep” by Radiohead, I delivered nonetheless. Here’s a video of that for your viewing… pleasure? Displeasure? Watch it and see for yourself.!#@p!#@It was Sunday past 8PM and I still had $60 of my weekly Interphase TechCash stipend left. Unless I wanted to eat leftover Cambridge Pizza for the next week, the only place where I could reasonably spend the money that was still open was HMart. I slipped on my headphones, put this song on loop, and began walking over there.!#@p!#@The first half of the summer had fallen behind me and I was watching the second one rapidly follow suit. My recent midterm grades, my upcoming p-sets, the next steps for my Edgerton project, the friends I already had and all the ones I was still making, my room and our raves and all the countless laughs I’d had with people who I could trust to hold me up when I needed it, no matter what– the song’s soft guitar intro and the constant horn honking and chatter of Cambridge blended together to score my rising stream of thoughts, finally allowed to wander after being walled off by yet another day of constant activity. By the time I got to HMart, my whole summer was rushing through my mind, rising in intensity with the song’s melody before they both fell to a lull as I came to a realization: I didn’t need anything. From HMart or anywhere else. I already had everything I wanted.!#@p!#@I asked my friends if they wanted anything and ended up leaving the store with a towering bag of fruits for Carlos, guava candies for Daniel, and an unreasonable amount of instant ramen for everyone else, the song starting over as I stepped out into the hush of Cambridge at twilight. As I looked up at the impossibly deep blue sky, it hit me that I was walking through a city, my city, alone with a towering bag of groceries. That every waking moment I had belonged to me, taking place in a little world I’d carved out all for myself. I’d failed a p-set and gotten a new laugh and found people who liked my Morrissey impression, and in doing so, I’d lived a life that was truly all my own for the very first time.!#@p!#@In a few weeks, I’d pack my bags and leave my summer room, feeling a slight apprehension at the thought of returning home and putting my new life on pause. But even then I’d know that, no matter what, I could always dig up those experiences from the back of my mind and breathe. In the days that hung between our early move-ins to our fall dorms and my brief departure from campus before orientation began, I’d run from dorm to dorm with my friends, feeling my little corner of the world grow slightly with each laugh-filled step. We’d choose one to end our adventure at, curling up on a lounge couch to watch some stupid TV show none of us cared about nearly as much as we cared about the fact that we were watching it together. And they’d get up to play pool but I’d stay there, closing my eyes and letting their newly familiar voices and laughs guide me to sleep. I’d hear them say look, she’s asleep a few minutes before I actually was, and catch a few words of them debating the best way to wake me up when it was time to leave. Like a kid falling asleep on the way back from a grownup party, pretending not to wake up when the car stopped and one of my parents picked me up, tucked me into bed, and gave me a kiss on the cheek, I’d stand somewhere outside my little world and let a warm feeling fill my chest at the sight of how everything unfolded when I wasn’t around. And I’d feel ready for another eternity in it, though, for now, four more years would do.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0169-400x369.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/tunes-of-interphase/
dance dance dance! by Ellie F. '28,a weekend of trying to try everything,by Ellie F. '28,"September 17, 2024","Anyone who knows me from high school or Mathcamp or SSP⁠01 knows that I have the tendency to do everything. I’m in clubs and choirs, running events, and starting (and sometimes even finishing!) silly side projects constantly. Doing things makes me happy, even though it makes my schedule a bit claustrophobic. But hey! PNR exists for a reason, and now seems like the best time to try everything I can.!#@p!#@If you’ve ever seen me near music, you’ll quickly learn that I love to dance. I’m a Minecraft parrot—put any kind of music near me, and I start grooving and schmoving. I’ll bop to classical, rap, and the hold music that plays when I try to call customer service. I’ll nod along to songs I know by heart, and much more often, music that I’ve never heard in my life.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/groovin-400x225.jpg]!#@I’ve been dancing my whole life, but when Covid struck, I stopped taking classes. For all of high school, I danced at home for fun, twirling through my kitchen in socks and pulling so many pique turns and pirouettes in my backyard that I wore holes into four (4) pairs of tennis shoes. But I really miss dancing with other people, and I want to improve! So, on the first weekend after classes started, I decided to try every dance audition or event I could fit into my schedule. 02 Why? Why not?!#@p!#@My auditionmaxxing weekend started with the DanceTroupe showcase. I rolled up with a cup filled with cereal because I didn’t have time to get breakfast, and settled back to enjoy the show. We got to see the choreographers show off all their dances, in hip-hop inspired, contemporary, ballet, and tap styles.!#@p!#@Speaking of tap, the next item on my agenda was an miTAP audition! Having not tapped in half a decade (!!), I was definitely pretty underprepared—I was the only person that didn’t have tap shoes. After warm-ups, I discovered the joy (not) of trying to do pullbacks in tennis shoes. But the miTAP officers were so sweet and let me adapt. Then, we learned a short routine. Even though my final rendition was very far from perfect, I was so happy to try tapping again with such talented dancers.!#@p!#@Afterwards, I had a serendipitous run-in with Jorge, a current sophomore who taught our friends and I some Latin dances at CPW. He mentioned he was going to his club’s Casino Rueda class, and I had free time, so I joined the circle and learned moves like guapea, dame directo, and un fly. 03!#@p!#@Between all the dancing, I also auditioned for the Video Game Orchestra (VGO) as a violist! It was the chillest and most enjoyable audition I had ever been to. I just had to play a scale and do some sightreading, and I even got to play The Legend from Deltarune for my prepared piece.!#@p!#@Okay back to dancing :) This time, I went to the Ballroom Dance Team’s team match event, where members of the ballroom dance team were paired with rookies in six dances: foxtrot, waltz, rumba, cha-cha, and swing. Because of my VGO audition, I arrived late, so I wasn’t competing. Instead, I got to admire the pairs dance very beautifully around the floor and cheer for the even numbered team.!#@p!#@Immediately after, I went to Bhangra! Bhangra is a style of dance from the Punjab area of India, and it is so joyful and energetic. I’ve definitely never tried anything similar to it, but the team taught us the basic moves really well. The room was really really hot (⅔ of the fans were broken), and we were jumping and double-bouncing constantly, but the music and dance were so purely fun and happy that I didn’t even mind (okay just a little). Still, I deserved SO MUCH ice cream after that much exercise.!#@p!#@The biggest part of Sunday was auditions for DanceTroupe. My first audition was for contemporary, and we learned a routine to Torn. I realized that I missed dancing contemporary a lot! I love getting to be dramatic and trying to convey emotions through my movements.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/car-guy.gif]!#@After my contemporary audition, I went to ballet. I did barre for the first time in years and am still sore from adagio.⁠04 We also did all sizes of jumps and leaps! Wheeeee! Overall, the DanceTroupe auditions were very relaxed and not stressful at all, and I think they’d be a great experience for anyone interested in dancing, at all skill levels.!#@p!#@Bonus round!! I also auditioned for Next Sing, an acapella group. It was short and sweet, with some range tests as a warmup, rhythm and pitch matching tests, an optional sight-reading, and a short excerpt from a song I chose (part of Killer Instinct from Bring It On)!#@p!#@Auditioning, or any way of putting yourself out there, is kinda scary. I felt a bit intimidated many times over my weekend of auditions, but I bet I’ll feel the same way a lot while I’m at MIT. More than that, though, I felt welcomed at every audition I went to. I’m taking that as a sign to keep trying a little bit of everything that interests me, like an easily distractible kid in a candy store. Maybe I’ll find a new hobby, a new friend, a new community, or maybe I won’t. But that’s alright, because either way, I’ll keep dancing and doing the things I love.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/please-i-just-want-this-duck-gif-to-work.gif]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/groovin-400x225.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/car-guy.gif;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/please-i-just-want-this-duck-gif-to-work.gif,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/dance-dance-dance/
LET ME COOOOOOOK 🍳🍳🍳 by Fiona L. '27,"I am stupidly excited about learning this Basic Life Skill, and not ashamed to admit it.",by Fiona L. '27,"September 16, 2024","“On a scale from one to ten, where one is ‘Eat to Live,’ and ten is ‘Live to Eat,’ where would you rate yourself?”!#@p!#@The question was asked at a fancy restaurant in Republic Square, Yerevan, after I and some other MISTI⁠01 interns had returned from an excursion to Dilijan, a neighboring city in Armenia.!#@p!#@I thought about how I would rate myself. I had grown up in a family of people who loved to eat. Whenever I went out with friends, I would always want to do something food related. I saw these hangouts not just as an opportunity to spend time with my friends, but also as a chance to get poke bowls at the mall, try out a new restaurant downtown, or indulge in desserts. I’m easily tempted with cake and bribed with chips or candy. Sometimes, during particularly stressful or loathsome days, my meals were the main thing I looked forward to. In fact, in the past overeating was a problem for me: sometimes I’d have a particularly good meal and then experience an “ohmygodimgonnagetatummyachetomorrowwhydididothat” kind of thing.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.16.30-PM.png]!#@“I’d probably be a nine,” I replied. “Or maybe a ten.”!#@p!#@With all this in mind, it’s a surprise that I never learned how to cook. My parents were never that big on cooking: I remember my high school meals being comprised of microwaved food and Chinese takeout. My mom and dad both worked demanding jobs, and didn’t have time to cook for my brother and I. Apart from one summer where I mastered only a single simple dish–the glorious sunny side up egg–I also didn’t find time to learn how to cook. Most of my time was spent on school, extracurriculars, and preparing for the impending reality of college decisions⁠02 .!#@p!#@Still, I don’t want to seem like I’m ungrateful for my parents. Speaking from a college student’s perspective, I really, really miss being able to sit down at the dinner table with my family⁠03 . All the time that my parents spent working was time they sacrificed to keep me and my brother fed and comfortable.!#@p!#@Unfortunately, I didn’t make any progress on my cooking last year either. I spent my freshman year at Simmons, where I relied on the mandatory meal plan for food, and, not wanting to waste money, I used up all 225 of my meal swipes during my freshman fall⁠04 . I found that I didn’t get what I wanted out of the meal plan. Not only was it expensive, I didn’t like the food in the dining halls much or the constrained schedules telling me when I could or couldn’t eat⁠05 . To make matters worse, I ate alone in the dining halls more often than I would’ve wanted to. I sometimes couldn’t coordinate meals with my friends because of our conflicting schedules, so if I couldn’t find somebody in the dining hall I knew well enough to eat with, I would sit alone, losing myself in the blue glow of my computer screen.!#@p!#@(Though, I’ve recently come to realize that I shouldn’t let my own social awkwardness get in the way of getting to know people. Asking people to eat lunch/dinner together is a really good ~friendmaking~ tactic I plan to employ more.)!#@p!#@That, combined with Simmons’ lack of floor/wing/suite community⁠06 , drove me to switch into MacGregor⁠07 at the end of my freshman year. I felt that if I wanted to thrive in MacGregor, I would need to learn how to cook. My mom doubted my abilities to do so, offering me a meal plan and Doordash/UberEats money. However, she only strengthened my resolve. I wanted to prove her–and my own doubts–wrong, showing her that, yes, I COULD learn how to cook.!#@p!#@First, I had to learn the theory of cooking. It’s my personal opinion that even if you know how to cook a specific recipe, that doesn’t mean you know how to cook⁠08 . Just being able to recall and go through the motions of a recipe doesn’t necessarily mean you know how to handle a knife, how and when to season, how to make meat the tenderest it can be. I didn’t know any of these things, so I knew I had a lot to learn.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.16.36-PM-3-400x423.png]!#@As a freshman, I took advantage of my new freedom and developed an assortment of random hobbies: crochet, embroidery, drawing, etc. Simply searching for helpful tutorials on Youtube was my substitute for private lessons, and a large part of the current foundation of my skills. I figured that I could tackle cooking in a similar way. I searched up videos about cheap cooking, meal prep, and cooking as a college student, then added those videos into a playlist I could binge whenever I wanted to feel hungry.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.17.06-PM-4-400x466.png]!#@The next step is the practice of cooking. I decided I wouldn’t start practicing until I came to MIT, since there was no place to cook in my AirBnb⁠09 . To make matters a little easier for myself, I signed up for a Hello Fresh subscription after finding a promo code in a Youtuber’s video, with the intent of canceling after the generous first-week discount.!#@p!#@Learning how to cook has gotten me excited, as I mentally plan and envision what I’m going to make next year. Whether it be traditional Chinese mapo tofu to experimental cheese waffles, no dish will be out of my reach as I attempt to become a master chef during the remainder of my MIT career. I love sampling new dishes, new methods of cooking, new ways of adding a unique kick of flavor to my food. I also want to see if I can recreate some of my favorite Armenian and Georgian dishes from this summer– khinkali⁠10 , dolma⁠11 , and my beloved lahmajo⁠12 . There’s a bakery next to my AirBnb, and I try to peek through the windows from the other side of the street every time I walk back from work. If I see a stack of lahmajo on the bakery counter, I cross the street and buy a lahmajo, sometimes paired with a bottle of spicy tomato juice. Now that the summer is nearing its end, the cashier’s started to remember my face and my order. “One lahmajo?” she asks, before the words can even stumble out of my mouth.!#@p!#@Other than my love of food, I want to learn to cook for the health benefits. This summer, I’ve been trying to health-ify my lifestyle in order to lose the weight I gained during freshman year and get back to a healthier weight. I walk to work, take full advantage of the company gym, and eat in more reasonable portions. I figured that home-cooked meals, with their more reasonable portion size, inclusion of meat and fresh greens, and lack of ultra-processing or artificial flavorings, would help me maintain a healthy weight next semester.!#@p!#@Yet there’s one last reason I want to cook, a reason I can’t bear to ignore. When I was very young, my grandmother still lived in the US with my parents and myself. Before the microwavable meals and the stained Chinese takeout containers, there was fried rice, fragrant meat, and lots and lots of spices. I never knew where my grandma learned to cook, where she went to school, what she did as a career. My Chinese was never good enough to communicate with her, let alone the fact that she spoke the regional dialect of her hometown. But I knew without a doubt that she loved my brother and I. I could taste it in the undertones of flavors in my meals, see it in the hours she hunched over a wok, even as walking became harder and her joints started to ache and ache with age. I still really miss all those days and all those meals. Even though, with the passing years, it all seems to blur together in my memory.!#@p!#@But I have a lot more good memories to make in the future. In the same way I experienced love through home-cooked meals, I want to show my friends I care about them by nourishing them–and making SURE that they enjoy that nourishment. Next semester, you can find me inviting my friends over for dinner-and-movie-nights, asking for constructive criticism on my latest cookie experiment, and trying to rope as many unsuspecting victims potential friends into my culinary endeavors.!#@p!#@I can’t end this post without talking about a central part of my food fixation–spice. There was another way in which my family showed their care through food, although this example is a whole less sentimental and a lot more… unique(?). When I was young, my dad tried to train me to be able to eat spicy food. I would eat rice stained with sriracha, interspersed between scoops of ice cream to ease the flames on my tongue. My dad’s logic was that, if I learned to eat spicy food, I would be able to eat spicy and non-spicy food alike. I’d say it mostly worked out. Even though I can eat both kinds of food now, I ended up strongly preferring spicy food due to my “training.” I’d constantly order the spiciest item on restaurant menus, and reach across tables to add chili sauce to my food. But I suppose this is also a cultural thing: my dad is from Hunan, a province of China known for its dry-and-spicy cuisine. When I went to China in middle school, I discovered that virtually every dish in Hunan, whether it be a main course or a humble appetizer, was spicy. I was in heaven.⁠13 . I’m sad that my spice tolerance has decreased because of dining hall food, but I hope that these next few years can fix things back to normal. Cue the mapo tofu, hot pot, zha jiang noodles, and spicy Samyang ramen.!#@p!#@So, here’s to a delicious sophomore year! My hope is that I can feed myself, and all the people I’ve grown to care about here, properly. I’d be overjoyed if others like eating my food, even more so if they could handle the spice I put into my own meals. I also hope that when my mom comes over for Family Weekend, I can show her some of my new skills. I want to see the surprise on her face when she learns that, yes, I actually am cooking for myself. But I also want to see her happiness–when she tastes the hours I spent learning some classic Chinese dishes, when she realizes that I included mushrooms even though I can’t stand the texture because I know they’re her favorite food.!#@p!#@Oh. One last thing.!#@p!#@Let’s pray I don’t burn this place down.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.16.30-PM.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.16.36-PM-3-400x423.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-2.17.06-PM-4-400x466.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/let-me-coooooook-%f0%9f%8d%b3%f0%9f%8d%b3%f0%9f%8d%b3/
how not to be a mathematician by Fatima A. '25,on taking time & not running away,by Fatima A. '25,"September 15, 2024","By the end of my freshman year, I was convinced that I had not learned anything in my classes at MIT. By the end of my sophomore year, the belief cemented. If anything, I felt like I had gotten less smarter than before. I felt lost and unhappy, wondering if I truly did not belong here, if I would have been better off someplace else. In classes, I thoroughly believed that I just could not learn the content deeply, no matter how hard I tried. Although for many people, MIT convinces them that nothing is impossible (and in some ways, it did that for me), for the most part in terms of math academics, I had fallen to believe something completely different. I was running away from any true interactions with math peers and professors, people I respected and admired, solely because I thought they would find out how little I know and how stupid I was and I didn’t want that to happen.!#@p!#@The question of whether I wanted to do math began to nudge me more often. I wondered if I was doing it purely out of ego and stubbornness and not because I actually wanted to. I didn’t do a math UROP for the first 2.5 years of MIT, I went to office hours less often than I should’ve for my math classes, I did not participate actively in any of the math clubs, and barely made any friends in my math classes. Yes, I knew people who did math, but I knew them despite it and not because of it, and for the most part, our conversations were sanitized of math.!#@p!#@I accepted the lack of belonging I felt towards the math department. I didn’t think it was a big deal; I had friends and other communities I cared about. In my head, I had divided my math vs. HASS classes, classes where I will never talk to anyone new and classes where I could have deep, meaningful conversations just as a consequence of the structure. But, taking a physics class my sophomore spring, I realized that even science classrooms don’t have to be quite as cold. There would be many people in office hours working together and although I didn’t do too well in the class, there was a sense in which I didn’t feel utterly hopeless.!#@p!#@Eventually, I decided to study abroad. I was going to be at Imperial, meaning that I could only take math classes. It felt like a bit of a graduate school preview in many ways and I wanted to find out whether I would like that at all. I also wanted to see what the math community looked like there, somewhere that wasn’t MIT. Overall, this experience impacted my graduate school decision positively. The more time I had to learn math, I just wanted to learn more. I knew I wasn’t done.!#@p!#@I reached out to two of my old mentors, Paige B. ’24 and Pam S. ’23, both of whom have helped me with classes and who I admired a lot but never had the courage to really reach out. It turned out, they did not hate me (inconceivable). In fact, they were unbelievably kind and we chatted about math and physics and general anxiety regarding life after MIT. Frankly, the only thing that helped me be less afraid to reach out in the first place is realizing that my time at MIT is so limited and I valued the people around me a lot more than I value any perception they have of me.!#@p!#@During this time, I began to strongly feel my lack of participation in the math department. Though I had complained about it far too much, I had never done anything to cause the change I had hoped to see. In hopes to remedy that and in hopes of feeling more like a part of the math department, I signed up to help with Discover Mathematics, the math pre-orientation program.!#@p!#@In the summer, I went back to Chicago, where I had been for the summer after my freshman year. Two years ago, I was one of the youngest people there and the most lost. I had no algebra background (first isomorphism theorem who) and generally felt confused talking to one of my mentors. My main goal for this summer was to become slightly more fluent in my mentor’s language, that is to say, learn a little bit about the terms he uses quite often. As I went through this exercise of jumping from topic to topic, I realized how far I had come. Although some of the concepts still made little sense, I could follow a lot of what I was learning. That weird phrase people throw about, mathematical maturity, I had some of that! As the summer proceeded, I got to meet some of my friends from the REU two years ago. We had fun, socialized and talked about math. They told me about opportunities that might be interesting to me and gave me advice about graduate school. In addition to that, I derived a lot of motivation from our conversations. I began to wonder how differently things would have turned out if I had talked to more people who did math, if I had been less afraid.!#@p!#@I don’t think I have a lot to show for this summer, mostly because I hopped around so many different topics I couldn’t do one in depth, but I came out feeling a lot more hopeful for the future. I learned a lot and got a lot better at reaching out to people. And, although I never felt this before, ever in my MIT career, I finally feel like I have learned stuff from my classes at MIT. I may not remember every proof and every statement, but it is easier to learn now than it used to be. Most importantly, the deep curiosity lives on.!#@p!#@It is still scary to think about the future, if I will survive graduate school, but I feel more excited about how the next years unfold. I am optimistic about learning math and finding people who will support me. How bad can it be.!#@p!#@It really took me three full years to even begin to feel like I could be a math undergraduate, even though that had always been my major. I had hoped to get here by the end of my freshman year but I am here now. If you are a current underclassman in the same boat as I was, feeling lost and confused and out of place, I am sending lots of hugs and care. It does get better, learning math takes time and wells of patience. Each person has their own place in math and you will find a weird niche topic you care about and a weird community that cares about that weird niche topic and suddenly, everything will not feel so scary anymore. My only advice to you would be to let yourself take that time, do not look at what others are doing, be unbearably patient with yourself, talk to many, many people, simply never be afraid, and most importantly, fuck around and find out.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-not-to-be-a-mathematician/
"learning how to drive by Mel N. '24, MEng '25",and other matters of identification,"by Mel N. '24, MEng '25","September 12, 2024","STEP 1: FAIL TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL.!#@p!#@This requires some luck based on your circumstances. It’s going to be a bit harder if you live in a more suburban or rural area and local bus routes don’t pass by your house. However, if you live in a big city or within walking distance to your high school, DING DING DING! You’re in a prime position to complete the first step.!#@p!#@Take driver’s ed, that’s fine — it’s a rite of passage to sit in a classroom after school with a dozen other kids and watch a bunch of scary car crash videos. This will heighten your anxiety and make you even less certain about learning how to drive, especially if you don’t need to.!#@p!#@If you have to get around, hitch a ride with your friends who do know how to drive. Impress them on aux with your highly curated playlists, and realize on the highway that there’s a little piece of paper stuck to the windshield. Is that a ticket??? Time to panic. Oh my god is it going to fall off??? Time to panic some more. Get off the highway with the paper still secured and pull over. Realize that it’s a handwritten note:!#@p!#@Have your friends drop you off at your home at the end of the night, but don’t get out of the car immediately. Instead, drive around your block slowly while you talk about being sixteen-seventeen-eighteen, confused and hopelessly romantic and angry at the world. Cherish these nights while you still have them.!#@p!#@STEP 2: FAIL TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IN COLLEGE.!#@p!#@This is a little easier than step one, because if you didn’t learn how to drive in high school, you’re probably not going to learn how to drive in college. That’s okay. It’s likely that the public transport around your college is pretty good, especially if you go to MIT.!#@p!#@React with some alarm when you hear that you have to submit an ID photo, because you’ve just graduated high school and you’re still shy about pictures of yourself. Spend half an hour in the backyard trying to take a head-on selfie in direct sunlight because it’s 2020 and golden hour selfies have been all over Instagram these past couple of years. End up with a result you’re mostly okay with except for the fact that you’re squinting because you were staring into the sun. That’s okay. Blink away the sunspots and manually edit the picture to have a white background. Now it looks like a passport photo.!#@p!#@Obtain an MIT ID upon landing at freshman orientation with that awkward photo printed on it, and be told by very nice people that it also serves as a public transit card — a CharlieCard. You catch glimpses of other people’s ID photos and realize that 1) it was fine to submit a picture that wasn’t strictly front-facing, you could have had your head at a 3/4 angle, and 2) it didn’t even need a white background.!#@p!#@You will now spend four years swiping your CharlieCard in and out of MBTA stations. Visit New York City and be impressed by their credit card tap systems, and wish for that to happen in Boston so that you’re not screwed if your card isn’t charged and the entrance you went through doesn’t have a fare machine. Your wish will be granted eventually.!#@p!#@You’ll turn 21 and realize you don’t have a license for getting into 21+ spaces, only your passport, which you bring along a couple times before everyone convinces you that it’s a BAD IDEA. So you apply for a Massachusetts resident ID card instead. Even if you spend a lot of time doing your makeup, you will somehow end up with a half-frowning expression on your ID photo. That’s okay. At least you won’t lose the ability to travel to other countries at bars now.!#@p!#@Your mother will likely nag you to learn how to drive the summer between your junior and senior years, but you will not do anything about it. You just joined a research lab where almost no one drives, or they just learned how to drive very recently — including the PI. This makes sense in your head because it is a marine ecology lab.!#@p!#@Talk to one of your supervisors and hear that she’s learning how to drive from a driving school in Boston. You ask about which school it is, and try to get in contact to schedule lessons, but you’re told that you need to get your learner’s permit first. You’ll register for an appointment at the RMV to take the permit test, but forget to study for it because you were so immersed in your research, and figure that you’ll learn how to drive some other time.!#@p!#@STEP 3: REALIZE THAT DRIVING IS PROBABLY A GOOD SKILL TO HAVE.!#@p!#@A year will go by, and you’ll get a crazy idea to do a cross-country road trip the summer after graduation. Tell everyone about this, but also, you don’t know how to drive, and chances are, that’s an important part of going on a road trip.!#@p!#@It’s time to lock in. Register for another appointment at the RMV. Study the Massachusetts driver’s manual furiously. Graduate. Give your final research presentation to your group and cry because you loved everyone in your lab so much.!#@p!#@Take your permit test a couple days after graduation and shock the RMV worker because you went into the testing room and came back less than five minutes later. Receive your paper permit and call up a local driving school, but you will quickly realize that it’s summer and the population of people wanting to take driving lessons includes you and all the high schoolers in the area. Schedule your lessons a month out and decide that maybe you’ll fly for most of for your trip instead.!#@p!#@Your lab supervisors give you a copy of the Mechanic Shop Femme’s Guide to Car Ownership as a graduation gift. You cry a little more.!#@p!#@STEP 4: GET BEHIND THE WHEEL AND DON’T CRASH.!#@p!#@It’s July. It’s the day of your first driving lesson. It’s raining. On the way to where you’ll be picked up, you watch a motorcyclist slide and crash into the curb at a stoplight. People check on him and he’s fine, he gets up and drives away, but you wonder if that’s a bad omen.!#@p!#@Arrive at the pickup location. You will probably end up on the wrong side of the street at first. That’s okay. You’ll spot the car with the giant STUDENT DRIVER sign on top eventually. Emanate nervous energy when you get into the car, but listen attentively when the very nice and patient driving instructor tells you all the things you need to do. Shift gears and press the gas pedal (nice and easy) and…you’re driving. You’re going to be so intensely focused on trying to pay attention to everything that you won’t notice how tightly you’re gripping the steering wheel until you get to a red light and your entire body sags a bit when you finally let yourself breathe.!#@p!#@Leave that first lesson a little more confident in yourself, and very grateful to your instructor.!#@p!#@It’s the day of your second driving lesson. You get in the car, still nervous, but you think you understand the basics now. It’s a different instructor this time, and he doesn’t say much, but he seems a little annoyed at you. You’re being kind of slow while you make sure everything’s in order.!#@p!#@“DRIVE!”!#@p!#@You drive. You make a lot of mistakes, which your instructor does not hesitate to point out. You tear up a little as you wind through residential routes but you don’t want to seem weak. You leave feeling kind of deflated. Maybe it was beginner’s luck on the first day?!#@p!#@It’s the day of your third driving lesson. It’s the instructor from yesterday. You’re a little wary when you get in the car, but you know what to do now, and you’re making fewer mistakes, and you’re even cracking a few jokes. By the end of it, you think you’ve won him over.!#@p!#@More lessons fly past, and eventually, it’s time to take your road test. It is at 9 AM. You have an international flight later that evening. It’s now or never.!#@p!#@It’s raining again, just like the first day. You line up next to a group of other people and wait. You chat with the high school kid in front of you for a little bit, and then it’s your turn. You think you’re doing pretty good, until you almost forget to put the car in park when you’re asked what to do when you park downhill with a curb because your brain goes blank, but you remember at the last minute. When you circle back to the starting point, the examiner is so expressionless that you’re not even sure if you passed or not, but you see the cursive letters on your permit.!#@p!#@You get on the Green Line to head home and you are SO HAPPY.!#@p!#@STEP 5: BECOME A LICENSE-CARRYING MEMBER OF SOCIETY.!#@p!#@You get back from your trip and your shiny new driver’s license is in the mail. Unfortunately, it’s the same half-frowning photo as your Massachusetts ID, but it’s fine. You’ll have the chance to retake it eventually…right?!#@p!#@Summer ends and it’s time to start your MEng. You feel so old now. The halls feel different — they’re alive with an energy that no longer belongs to you. A new chapter in the institutional memory book.!#@p!#@You’ll probably want to print a new MIT ID because your old one is pretty beat up and it doesn’t really look like you anymore. You uploaded a new picture a while ago, so it’s all updated in Atlas. You go to a printing station in Stata and wait a couple minutes for it to print.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@You do a double take.!#@p!#@IT LOOKS SO DIFFERENT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3456.jpg]!#@There’s no longer a holographic MIT logo flashing on your card. Instead, it’s a simple flat white background.

The dust is just now settling from the whirlwind of graduation, and so many of your friends are scattered all over the country.!#@p!#@You miss the way things were. But you’ve come so far.!#@p!#@And now you know how to drive.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3456.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2733-1000x786.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/learning-how-to-drive/
From First Visit to First Week by Richard O. '28,A Reflection on Independence and Making Decisions,by Richard O. '28,"September 12, 2024","Last week I started classes at MIT. A simple 7-part sentence that would’ve meant the world to freshman me back in high school. But as I prepare for my 4-year journey that will probably include a lot of late nights and interesting experiences, I want to reflect a little on my first trip to this campus which I think really changed the way I’ve viewed my preparedness for this next stage of my life. More specifically, the independence that came from visiting MIT the first time.!#@p!#@Looking back, there’s something about traveling that I think can be fulfilling and scary at the same time – especially traveling alone. On one hand, I think it’s really cool that in today’s world, you can press a few buttons on a screen, and in a few months a large cylinder with wings can take you halfway across the east coast to a state you’ve never set foot in. But on the other hand, traveling alone is also an experience that I think can change the way you see yourself – at least it did for me.!#@p!#@Probably like most of my peers, I don’t live near Cambridge. And the last time I was on a plane was when my family went to Ghana back in 2017. So visiting MIT last April for the first time for CPW ⁠01 was something completely new to me – not just because I had never been on the campus before but also because I don’t travel that much. And this time, I was traveling by myself. No parents. No Siblings. No friends. Just a backpack, a carry-on suitcase, and a newly purchased MIT sweatshirt that I probably wore to school a few too many times prior.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6659-1-400x300.jpg]!#@But I very vividly remember the moment I said bye to my dad at the airport after he helped me check my ticket before leaving. In that moment as I was waving and watching him walk back towards the entrance after dropping me off, I began to realize that I was really on my own – not just in the fact that I was flying by myself, but more importantly in the fact that I had reached a point in my life where I truly had a sense of autonomy in my life decisions. Neither of my parents had made me go on this trip. The flight had no credit requirement that would show up on my high school transcript or worksheet that had to be submitted for a grade. Applying to MIT wasn’t even an expected activity for a club or anything like that. The whole thing was the culmination of decisions I made about my life – for myself. And that for me was…different. I was so used to living with frameworks and expectations from school and the people around me that the realization of me having this much responsibility over my life decisions was a weird thing that hung in my mind the whole time I waited for my flight.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6726-2-400x300.jpg]!#@But after the short 90-minute trip (filled with regret after finding out that cellular plans don’t actually work on planes and I should’ve downloaded my music playlists before taking off) I realized that this independence, as weird as it was, could also be empowering. In the next 3.14 days, I had the chance to meet people who came from all over the world (literally) and were amazing in their own way – some of which were people I had met on Instagram and it was really great to finally meet them in person.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/View-recent-photos.jpeg-400x222.png]!#@Some photos with said amazing people:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_9836-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7067-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7029-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6970-800x1067.jpg]!#@But looking back I now notice that it’s okay to feel lost and alone sometimes. It’s okay to feel nervous about being independent and making decisions. Because at the end of the day, you aren’t alone. Yes, I took a flight by myself to somewhere completely new in the middle of exam reviews. But I wasn’t the only one experiencing this – I was among 1,000+ other students also leaving their homes to come somewhere that may have been completely foreign to some of them – and that’s okay. Because making these decisions is what life is all about – regardless of whether or not things go the way you plan.!#@p!#@And just like the several thousand people here on campus as well as the millions of students on other college campuses have found their way up to the start of classes for this semester, I’ve somehow managed to navigate my own journey up to where I am now and hope that as I continue through MIT I’ll be able to embrace this independence and learn more about myself and what I want to do and be after college.!#@p!#@Because after all, thanks to this independence, I got to experience MIT and all its unique aspects from its underground tunnels to its famous Great Dome…by myself, in the middle of Cambridge, almost 500 miles away from home.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6850-400x300.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6659-1-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6726-2-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/View-recent-photos.jpeg-400x222.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_9836-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7067-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7029-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6970-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6850-400x300.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/from-first-visit-to-first-week/
a year of counting fish by Kai V. '25,the shape of real work,by Kai V. '25,"September 11, 2024","When I was a freshman I joined a plasma physics lab. Plasma physics is beautiful stuff, magnetic flux tubes and reconnection and turbulence, which I came to appreciate over the two years that I did this research. But I first became interested because if you figure out those beautiful things, then you can write down equations to plug into a simulation, and that simulation can give you a better idea of how plasma behaves in a fusion reactor. Then, of course, you build the perfect fusion reactor and you save the world.!#@p!#@That isn’t how it turned out, though. I started the project—and college—thinking there were just a few big problems in the world, and I would pick one and work on it. With the endless opportunities and resources that MIT promised, I was excited to start doing “real work”, and the straightforward pipeline from equations to simulations to nuclear fusion seemed as real as anything I knew at that time.!#@p!#@Two years later I felt pulled apart in every direction. I quit the plasma physics research: to get any good at theoretical plasma physics you have to know a lot of things that I didn’t, or else be willing to put in time that I didn’t. And we’re a long way off from fusion power, even farther from commercial-scale fusion. The remaining challenges mostly lie in engineering, not esoteric plasma physics phenomena. 01!#@p!#@Nothing else I tried was any better. Twiddling with dimensions in SolidWorks for engineering teams felt even bleaker than reading opaque plasma physics papers. One policy class and then another showed me that I liked learning about policy, but politics felt depressing and unproductive. The more I explored, the more the very notion of “real work” became confused. In clubs I designed machines and built things with my hands, but then I ached for the process of research, of venturing into the unknown. In math and physics classes I made pretty discoveries about functional analysis and quantum mechanics in my psets, but then I felt a resistance to truly hunkering down and getting good at it, as if I was holding out for a better goal.!#@p!#@In my mind theory and impact existed on two sides of an impenetrable divide, what had once been a hairline crack before college but which now yawned wider by the day. In every field I turned to, the same question reared its head: in industry, how do you incorporate scientific discoveries into your work? Or in academia, how do you make sure your research will eventually benefit people? How does anyone ever get anything done?!#@p!#@When I asked the adults I knew who were scientists and engineers and policymakers, they all said that’s a really good question! and not one of them answered it. Would I not find, at MIT, a single anecdote from a single person who felt deep down that they could do not only good work, but real work for the world? 02!#@p!#@It’s been a bit over a year since that spring. Now, I have an anecdote.!#@p!#@By a strange twist of fate, in my junior year I found myself working on a project to count salmon. Here’s the idea. Salmon spawn in rivers and swim out to the ocean to spend their adult lives before returning to their home rivers to spawn the next generation of salmon. This is really important to the ecosystems surrounding their home rivers: spawning salmon provide food, and their bodies fertilize the rivers when they die. But their populations have waned with habitat loss and warming waters.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BIGSALMON-1-400x210.jpeg]!#@To see if a certain conservation measure (like taking down a dam, or releasing juvenile salmon into the wild) is working, we need an accurate method for measuring population. Currently people put sonar cameras in rivers and count the number of salmon swimming upstream or downstream when they return to spawn. This is very time- and labor-intensive, and it costs a lot to hire the technicians who do this counting, meaning that only a few rivers employ this sonar technology. Six years ago, some scientists including my PI asked, what if we apply computer vision to this problem? That’s the project I joined.!#@p!#@I thought a computer vision lab would focus on theoretical ML, but in fact, most of the work looks like this: given a problem, what data do you need to solve it, and how do you construct that dataset? How do you account for—a big problem in ecology—long-tailed distributions, where many classes of interest are sighted rarely, where 40% of your dataset is gazelles and 40% is zebras and the other 20% are a gazillion other species you want to identify correctly? How do you take a model which works well on data from one domain and develop some way of preprocessing or fine-tuning or unsupervised learning to help generalize the model to a new domain?!#@p!#@In group meetings for this salmon project we get even more concrete. Four dams are being removed on a big river this fall and they want to use our model to help count fish populations, before and after. Each Zoom call is a frenzy of discussion: we could give them our model as a web tool, but cloud GPU time is expensive; we could send it to them packaged in a Jetson (a little Linux box with NVIDIA GPUs), but it would be difficult to debug if anything went wrong during, say, a software update; we could buy them iPads and have them download an app, but then we’re getting into iOS app development. “Maybe Apple would sponsor us,” one professor muses. “They could have this slogan, ‘Apple saves the fish!’”!#@p!#@They’re not being facetious; iOS app development isn’t outside of the realm of possibility! My grad students are thinking of building a raytracer to generate synthetic fish data and modifying open-source annotation software. They build web apps to display multimodal data in sync, to query our database and collect clips more easily. I thought I might feel out of place as a physics and math student who, at the start of the project, had only used programming for plasma physics research before and barely knew what a class was—but everyone in the lab was picking up skills on the fly to cobble together applications, and I was no exception.!#@p!#@At the end of June, I flew to Seattle for a conference our group had organized. The idea was to aggregate all the people who were involved in this salmon counting project—my mentors at MIT, the other half of the group at Caltech, and for the first time, the people actually sitting watching the sonar video feed while fish swam by.!#@p!#@In the conference hall, we set up our model on a desktop and tested it on people’s hard drives of sonar clips. One guy had sorted his clips into Easy, Medium, and Hard. Our model failed miserably on the Hard ones, somehow predicting over a thousand fish swimming by because the water was so turbid that the same twenty fish kept flashing in and out.!#@p!#@My head felt fuzzy—my flight had been delayed by 12 hours overnight, and in the end I got just three hours of sleep—so I drifted out of conversations to refill my paper cup with coffee, conversations with an eclectic mix of ecologists and computer scientists, a short girl with dark hair and sure eyes who simulated fish populations in rivers, a tall skinny guy who’d pulled our code from GitHub and run it beforehand and was waving around a see-through red water bottle with an I Love Fish! sticker on it, a stocky man in a baseball cap who complained about how the NOAA wouldn’t fund the digitization of the decades of salmon counts they had yellowing in drawers.!#@p!#@The next morning we drove to a nearby river and stooped over inside an RV to watch sonar clips of fish swimming by while technicians explained how they found these clips in the video feed. In one clip, a beaver swam by and caught a fish, its great shadow bulging over the conical surface of the sonar field of view.!#@p!#@I could go on and on about how beautiful and green everything was and how the whole place felt alive and how everyone cared about it being alive. The more people I met in Seattle who were deeply invested in the wellbeing of the river and ocean ecosystems, the less I cared for my previous standards for “real work”.!#@p!#@Because there is care and beauty and impact in all different kinds of work. As a freshman wholly unused to the problems I’d encounter in the real world, my mistake had been to conflate “real” work with physical, engineering-type work, neatly quantified as increases in efficiency or quality of life; then, as a sophomore affected by the intellectual prestige climb, I conflated “real” work with whichever type of work felt hardest and most technical. But you can feel dissatisfied whether you’re building a solar farm or reading math papers. What matters is finding something to bridge the crevasse you can’t help but see.!#@p!#@Just like other people can’t help but want to code or make music or, I guess, think about topology, there’s this gaping chasm between theory and impact that I know I would be sneaking desperate glances at for years if I don’t try to bridge it now. In Seattle I peered into the chasm once more and, for the first time, caught a glimpse of the bottom. Learning from different people, collaborating with my mentors, driving a project from start to finish to the hands of people who will use its results—to me that’s the real work: real not as in physical or technical or even legitimate, but as in the work that makes my life feel richer for each moment I spend on it.!#@p!#@It felt fitting that my first-ever visit to Seattle was in the context of this salmon project. Wherever we walked, salmon iconography appeared in sculpted totem poles and colorful shop faces. By the time I left my heart felt very full. My mentor and another PhD student waved us goodbye as I stepped into the bus back to the airport with a member of my group who was flying out that night. “I’m glad you’ll be working here full-time this summer,” he said, sitting next to me. The air outside filled with orange as the sun sank below the skyline. “There is so much for us to do.”!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BIGSALMON-1-400x210.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-year-of-counting-fish/

[joint post] a guide to mit gyms by Kanokwan T. '25,see Gloria's post,by Kanokwan T. '25,"September 4, 2024",,,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joint-post-a-guide-to-dorm-gyms-2/
[joint post] a guide to mit gyms by Gloria Z. '26,"big brains, big gains 😤",by Gloria Z. '26,"September 4, 2024","Gloria: Contrary to popular belief, MIT students actually do exercise! We lift, run, dance and generally touch grass. One feature of MIT student life is that every dorm comes equipped with its own gym, which residents can tap into 24/7. Since the Zesiger Center⁠01 and Wang Fitness Center⁠02 have limited hours, those looking to squeeze in a quick 2AM lift often turn to their in-building fitness facilities instead. Each dorm gym has its own pros, cons, and personal quirks, and there’s something there to suit any and every workout routine. We’ve visited and lifted in (almost) all of them and chronicled/tier-listed them below for your convenience :).!#@p!#@Kano: Boston is an active city, and the gyms reflect it. Students get complimentary access to campus gyms, so it’s easier to take part. In addition to the confinement of hours like Gloria noted, campus gyms can also get quite busy. As someone who has worked the front desk for them, I’ve seen that space can be limited. So, dorm gyms come quite in handy!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gymtierlist-01-42-800x762.jpg]!#@We didn’t write detailed reviews of the institute gyms because they are just objectively the best. They have the most equipment, are thoroughly cleaned daily, and are huge.!#@p!#@Located in west campus, where most student dorms are, so the Z’s facilities are by far the most used.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Zcenter-800x445.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Zcenter2-800x529.jpg]!#@Located in east campus,⁠03 attached to Stata, so very convenient for those living in East Campus⁠04 and grad housing.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wangalumni.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wang2-1.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wang3-1-3.jpg]!#@the Equinox of MIT dorm gyms!#@p!#@GOOD: The BC gym is new and clean (post-remodel!), with everything you could want for your workout: three squat racks, an assisted pull up machine, a cable station, various leg and arm machines, and a good amount of cardio equipment (treadmills, erging machines, bike). It also has a large dance/yoga room attached, with wraparound mirrors.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: If we have to nitpick, the gym doesn’t have mirrors in front of the squat racks, which could be useful for checking form.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BC-2-1000x750.jpg]!#@small but mighty!#@p!#@GOOD: The New House gym is smaller in surface area but highly functional. It has one rack, some benches and free weights, a cable station, and some miscellaneous other machines and cardio equipment. It also has a speaker system you can connect your phone to to blast your music overhead, and a water fountain with nice cold water.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: There isn’t a huge variety of targeted machines, so this gym is better suited for free weight workouts. Because of the small surface area, it feels quite full when more than 3 or 4 people are using it at a time. And–the gym has floor-to-ceiling windows facing the street down dorm row, meaning everyone walking by has a crystal-clear view into it at night.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/newhouse-1000x750.jpg]!#@channeling dungeon chic!#@p!#@GOOD: This is one of the largest dorm gyms in terms of pure surface area. It comes equipped with a rack, plenty of free weights, and various machines.!#@p!#@CONS: As the subtitle suggests, the gym is a little… scrappy in terms of its equipment. Not all of the plates match, and many of them are the raw metal kind, not the rubber-coated ones. But this isn’t necessarily a con–I feel like the gym’s vibes are very conducive to locking in and pretending that you’re battling demons in order to get a better pump.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/macg-gym.jpg]!#@two glorious floors, many windows!#@p!#@GOOD: The Simmons gym has the essentials. It’s split across 2 floors: bottom for cardio and top for weightlifting, connected via a metal spiral staircase. For cardio, there are 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, and 3 stationary bikes. For weightlifting, there are 2 power cages, 1 cable station, 1 bench press, and an array of dumbbells. There are miscellaneous items like a punching bag, bosu ball, and foam roller. The windows tie the gym together well because you always get bright, natural lighting, unlike most dorms that have theirs located in the basement.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: It’s located on the 8th and 9th floors, so it can only be used in certain hours due to noise to nearby rooms. Additionally, the high floor makes it so that we can’t drop weights. There are no targeted machines, so weightlifting focus here is mostly on free weights.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons4-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons3-800x600.jpg]!#@neat and clean!#@p!#@GOOD: This gym is clean, has pretty nice and new equipment, and has a water fountain inside. It also has huge windows and nice natural light.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: The dorm is not that big and could definitely use some more machines. It also faces right onto the road, so you can make eye contact with everyone walking past.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/new_vassar-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/new_vassar2-800x600.jpg]!#@a tiny baby in the sky!#@p!#@GOOD: The view is AWESOME, perhaps the best, because it is on the rooftop. You get a panoramic view of the city, with, of course, great lighting. It’s mostly cardio and has some light weights: ellipticals, stationary bikes, treadmills, yoga balls, and some weights.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: Because it is on the top floor, the gym doesn’t have a power rack or any other “heavy” forms of lifting equipment. The location also make it such that it can get really loud on windy days.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mccormick-1000x667.jpg]!#@new house if it was aged like 5 years!#@p!#@GOOD: The Next House gym has a pretty good suite of equipment, including a couple benches, a rack, and some machines. It’s also got one of those climbing grip training boards, which is kinda fun, and enough mirrors.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: This gym is pretty small, so everything’s quite close together. It also feels a little musty, though maybe that’s just me (Gloria).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nexthouse1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nexthouse2-800x1067.jpg]!#@modest brick gym!#@p!#@GOOD: It has great upper lighting. There are a few essential machines: treadmills, ellipticals, stairmaster, calf press, cable machines, and an array of dumbbells.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: It’s small and cramped. While it has several good machines, the lack of space makes it hard to do much beyond them.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/baker1-1-800x445.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/baker2-800x397.png]!#@channeling dungeon grunge (grungeon)!#@p!#@GOOD: If you’re looking for a dystopia survivor-core gym, this is it. Located in the basement, filled with old pipes and loose weights, this gym elicits a particular “bunker” vibe. It’s under renovation right now, so I (Kano) can only tell you what I recall: there’s a calf press machine, power rack, leg press machine, bench press, stationary bike, and an array of dumbbells.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: There isn’t much stuff. The gym musty, rusty smell is real. The pipes were also low, so I couldn’t do jumping exercises without hitting them or standing in particular sections of the room (ex. jumping jacks). Feels like a sauna—not much ventilation.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec2-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec3-3-800x1071.jpg]!#@technically a gym!#@p!#@GOOD: The Maseeh gym is almost always empty, so you can sit on your phone as long as you want between sets without feeling embarrassed.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: This gym is equipped with exactly one rack, one bench, and one set of free weights, along with a few cardio machines. It’s also located right next to the ping pong and pool tables, so sometimes your workout or run is punctuated by the click and conversation of gameplay.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/maseeh.jpg]!#@four pieces of equipment!#@p!#@GOOD: The gym is set up with free weights, a weight machine, a treadmill, and an exercise bike. There’s also a mini trampoline! So, two weightlifting machines and two cardio machines. This gym meets the bare minimum, but it at least meets it.!#@p!#@LESS GOOD: It is very small and crowded. Good for when you want to work out in the dorm in a jiffy, but worth going out to larger, campus gyms if you’re looking for more specialty equipment.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/random-1000x750.jpg]!#@Gloria: As for our personal gym preferences, my top choice is almost always the Z. I really like having a slew of specialized machines to choose from, and I like working out in an environment with lots of other people focused on their own lifts. I find that when I work out in more secluded environments (like the Maseeh gym), it’s so easy to just sit on my phone or get distracted; being around others in a dedicated gym vibe keeps me locked in. The Z is also extremely close to Maseeh, where I live (it’s literally a straight line across the field). The one downside is that it can get extremely crowded at peak hours, so I generally try to go either between 10AM-1PM or from 10-11PM. If the Z is closed, I’ll either ask one of my BC friends to tap me into their gym or make do with what we have in Maseeh.!#@p!#@In the summer after my freshman year, however, I was working a UROP at the Media Lab, so I mainly used the nearby Wang Fitness Center instead. Since it was summer, it was mainly populated by grad students, and I did enjoy that the Wang center had a really large and generally empty dance/yoga room, where I could stretch or (attempt to) do calisthenics.!#@p!#@Kano: My gym location has depended on where I’ve lived. Though my routine has remained pretty constant: I prefer to go in the mornings, like 7-8am, because the machines are always available, and it’s harder for me to make excuses to not go. At night, when caught up with problem sets or projects or something, I found myself deprioritizing my workouts. I guess it also helps that I’m more of a morning person. I also get an energy burst after gym time, so it’s nice to start off rather than end my day with that. I lift most days. But, if I really didn’t feel like thinking about my workout, then I would let myself do a 30 min run instead.!#@p!#@For a few years, I did power rack and cardio stuff, so most gyms were fine for me. In freshman and sophomore year, I lived at East Campus, so I defaulted to the Wang Fitness Center and used the dorm gym when I was in a time crunch or when we were snowed in. During summer after freshman year, I lived at pika and frequented the Z by biking over. In junior year, I lived at Simmons and defaulted to the dorm gym.!#@p!#@These days, I’m using more targeted machines, so I’ll be headed to the institute gyms more often. I’m still at Simmons for my senior year, so I’ll continue using the dorm gym with some visits to the Z/Wang for specialty machines, as needed.!#@p!#@—!#@p!#@We wished a guide like this existed when we were starting off at MIT, so we hope you found this guide useful! Happy gymming. 💪!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gymtierlist-01-42-800x762.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Zcenter-800x445.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Zcenter2-800x529.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wangalumni.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wang2-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/wang3-1-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BC-2-1000x750.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/newhouse-1000x750.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/macg-gym.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons4-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/simmons3-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/new_vassar-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/new_vassar2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mccormick-1000x667.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nexthouse1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nexthouse2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/baker1-1-800x445.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/baker2-800x397.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec2-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ec3-3-800x1071.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/maseeh.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/random-1000x750.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/joint-post-a-guide-to-dorm-gyms/
"What I’m taking this semester! by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",senior fall,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","September 4, 2024","Classes start tomorrow! today! I started writing this at 11:55PM and now it’s 12:45AM.!#@p!#@I haven’t done a “what am I taking this semester” post in a while, because I think I jinxed sophomore fall last time. I shudder every time I look back on 6.3700.⁠01 Although 6.1200⁠02 was fun! But I digress.!#@p!#@This is the first upcoming semester that I haven’t felt so apprehensive about. It’s mostly because I have a lot more freedom to choose what classes I want to take now that I’m close to finishing my major (which is surreal), but it’s also a mindset change that’s come with becoming a senior, I think. I haven’t necessarily become “smarter”, I’ve just become used to working on assignments for longer periods of time. I’ve also grown an “idgaf if you think I’m stupid, I’m just here to learn” vibe to cope with imposter syndrome, and that’s generally improved my state of mind.!#@p!#@And honestly, there isn’t a single class that I’m not looking forward to! Which is also a first for me. There was always at least one class that I was reluctant to take.!#@p!#@CI-M (Communication Intensive in Major)⁠03!#@p!#@I have to take one more CI-M, and I’ve really wanted to take a robotics class. Robotics team was one of my favorite parts of high school, and robotics is the main reason why I ever got interested in AI in the first place. I’ll be lying if I say I’m not a little apprehensive, but I don’t have anything else to say other than that I’m quite excited for this class.!#@p!#@Plus, I could end up becoming a cool super villain or something.!#@p!#@EECS elective!#@p!#@I picked this class on the basis of “I have no idea what this is going to look like but it sounds dope” + good class rating.!#@p!#@There’s an alternate universe out there where I kept following my 6th grade interests and majored in brain stuff instead. Think about it, I’m writing this blog post because a meat blob full of electricity and chemicals is telling me to do it. That’s neat. Since the class is going into probabilistic and statistical modeling, I won’t be straying too far from what I’ve already learned.!#@p!#@AI+D_AUS (Advanced Undergraduate Subjects in AI + Decision Making)!#@p!#@I’m going to be honest, I just picked this class because its rating was really good. The more I think about it though, the more I’m looking forward to it.!#@p!#@I begrudgingly took Advances in Computer Vision [6.8301] last spring because I had to complete a CI-M by the end of junior year. Despite the issues that came from the unprecedented number of students who enrolled in the course, I ended up liking CV so much that I’m considering it as a possible field to delve into. 6.8371 is going to be a neat addition to that knowledge.!#@p!#@HASS⁠04!#@p!#@I’M SO SO SO SO SO EXCITED. I’ve wanted to publish a comic longer than I’ve wanted to do anything science and engineering-related, but I’d intimidate myself out of it every time. The longest comic I’ve worked on is this Harvard x MIT fanfic my friends and I made in freshman year, but I would like to create things that won’t get me sued by the Ivy League.!#@p!#@I had no idea 21W.744 was even offered this fall until a friend told me that she was taking it. Since it’s a limited enrollment class and I didn’t pre-register for it, I was nervous that I wasn’t going to get in, but I did!!#@p!#@HASS (CI-H)⁠05!#@p!#@I’m taking a second HASS to nurture my arts-loving soul. 1/4 of my YouTube recommendations are video essays made by film students, and there was a period in elementary school where I thought I wanted to become a movie director. We also get to watch a movie every Monday night!!#@p!#@Although, this is probably the class that I’ll drop if the semester gets too hectic. Every CI-H is built different, but they typically involve a good amount of writing.

We’re So Back by Emiko P. '25,a collage of preseason,by Emiko P. '25,"September 2, 2024","Preseason for fall sports is a span of two weeks in the summer before the semester starts, where women’s and men’s soccer, football, women’s volleyball, cross country, field hockey, and all the other fall sports come back to campus to prepare for the fall season. This period of time is when the hyphenated word of student-athlete flips and you become the mystical other thing: an athlete-student.

Painting by number by David duKor-Jackson,The anti-formula,by David duKor-Jackson,"September 2, 2024","!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PBN-Dome-400x225.png]!#@In a rant post many years ago, I referenced the concept of students completing elaborate “paint by number” applications that could often be appealing at first glance, but ultimately turn out to be woefully short on substance.  I want to revisit and elaborate on that notion because it remains apropos today as students continue to seek ways to unlock the secret formula to secure admission.!#@p!#@For starters, I can not argue with the logic of trying to discover the formula for admission, (even though there isn’t one).  This is MIT after all.  We love formulas.  When you combine the idea of creating an image based upon numbers, surely this is kismet.  Because the only thing we love more than formulas is numbers, or at least that is what people think.!#@p!#@There are actually quite a lot of things that we love.  We love learning.  We love solving hard problems.  We love to collaborate.  We love to express ourselves creatively, and perhaps most importantly, we love to do all of these things, and many more, simultaneously.!#@p!#@As such, the very idea that one can somehow orchestrate and compile a specific sequence of events, activities and accolades that will guarantee admission is completely antithetical to everything that we are about.!#@p!#@Let me go back to the concept of painting by number.  While the finished product could resemble a masterpiece, generally the best that it can aspire to be is a convincing counterfeit, which is typically not what we are going for when selecting students for our class.  It is also worth noting that many may take inspiration from the same idealized portrait of excellence, which frequently delivers a collection of submissions that are virtually indistinguishable from one another.  In those situations, a new interpretation, spawned either by creative license or necessity, given the available resources, may stand out from the crowd.!#@p!#@I know that this is difficult to reconcile for many students (and their parents) who have carefully curated portfolios designed to impress.  On the surface, they have done everything “right,” but the “how” and “why” are just as important as the “what.”  So when the fundamental response to “how” is that it was facilitated by parents and their connections rather than through individual initiative on the part of the student, or the “why” is because it will look good rather than because students are pursuing an area of genuine interest, the “what,” regardless of how impressive it may seem, loses a lot of its luster.!#@p!#@Institutionally, we aspire to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind, working with others to bring knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. None of that is achievable by simply following a path that has been blazed by others. It is essential, therefore, that students who aspire to be the creators and innovators of tomorrow engage in pursuits today that lay the groundwork for the challenges ahead.!#@p!#@A few things that I would suggest:!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PBN-Dome-400x225.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/painting-by-number/
Pre-Sophomore Year by Jessica Z. '27,in anticipation of the sophomore slump,by Jessica Z. '27,"September 1, 2024","Today was my first full day back on campus! This summer was a whirlwind of finishing finals, flying to DC, driving home to Pennsylvania, visiting family in Delaware and New York, and traveling to Cape Cod with some MIT friends before officially arriving back to my very-not-unpacked dorm room. We had a fire alarm go off in BC⁠01 this afternoon, and it truly felt like home <3!#@p!#@Despite the bulk of my traveling for this summer being done, I haven’t quite settled in yet. In fact, as I’m typing this now, I should be packing for my Chicago flight that leaves in a few hours. Instead, though, I’ve spent the past few hours thinking about this upcoming year.!#@p!#@It feels brighter on campus with a new class year⁠02 , and their excitement is infectious. It’s made me realize how excited I am for sophomore year.!#@p!#@I’m trying to be more conscious about the time between my drafts and actually posting, and part of that requires not thinking so heavily on each word, so bare with me as I’m trying to get back into the comfort of writing :’) That being said, here’s a quick ~brain dump~ of all the things I’m excited for this year!!#@p!#@Brass Rat & RingComm!#@p!#@We’re getting our class rings⁠03 this year!!!!!!! It almost feels wrong if I didn’t list this somewhere near the top of my list. I am so, so, so, so excited. I remember being in high school reading the blogs about the brass rat, and I feel an infinite amount of excitement about getting one this year. Equally as important to me, this year marks the more conscious journey to being halfway through my undergraduate education, and that is something I’m really proud of.!#@p!#@I’m also part of RingComm this year! We’ve been working together over the summer, and it’s quickly become one of my favorite experiences. When I applied to be a blogger, I partially wrote about how I enjoy capturing memories in creative ways and am learning to better understand different communities. To me, being on RingComm really helps fulfill both of those desires in a new way. I can confidently say it’s one of the most unique experiences I’ve been able to be part of :’)!#@p!#@20.110 & 17.307!#@p!#@Excited for a class is a… strong term… but I choose to have optimism! I’m taking 20.110: Thermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems this semester. Thermodynamics isn’t necessarily the field that I’m most interested in, BUT it will be my first Course 20 class since declaring my major! In an all-too-optimistic state, I tried studying for 20.110 over the summer but quickly stopped once my internship started picking up. I vaguely remember something about isothermal systems, gas expansion, and heat capacity? Regardless, I’m hoping that taking a Course 20 class will help me better understand what I want to study in the future.!#@p!#@I’m also taking 17.307: Public Policy for Washington Interns, which is a small class in coordination with the other MIT Washington DC Summer Internship Program interns. The class involves writing a policy paper, which I’ve barely read many of, let alone written one. I’m excited to see what the paper-writing process looks like—sans biological materials, laboratory methods, and yield percentages—from a public policy perspective.!#@p!#@Declaring Course 20!!#@p!#@Speaking of 20.110…I declared Course 20! I have a not-yet-posted blog⁠04 about how I’m still feeling slightly ~conflicted~ about this but submitted my Choice of Major Form to the office happily last Spring regardless.!#@p!#@I recently went through some journal entries from my freshman year, and I wrote about several moments where I felt academically inferiorer or not smart enough to confidently declare a major. I can’t say I’m 100% confident in declaring Course 20 now, but I can for sure say that I feel the most confident I’ve been, which is a huge step from last year.!#@p!#@I recently got my Course 20 advisor, too! She focuses on studying biomaterials for medical therapeutics and devices. I have admittedly spent too much time learning about her interests in biological engineering, and I’m really excited to learn more from her. I’m not a huge fan of straight molecular and cellular biology, which is largely why I chose Course 20 over Course 7. I also had loosely considered Course 3, but ultimately decided that Course 20 better suited my interests. I feel a lot more relieved entering my second year knowing my advisor is also interested in biomaterials, and I’m excited to meet her in September!!#@p!#@Writing, Journaling, & Blogging!#@p!#@At some point last Spring, I threw all my blog drafts into a massive Google Doc that I’ve been slowly⁠05 chugging through to post in hopes of catching up to my current life. For example, I have a good chunk of almost-done, backlogged blog posts from the end of Spring semester that never surfaced after school ended.!#@p!#@I mentioned briefly above that I’m trying to be more confident in my writing to reduce the amount of time I spend between drafting and posting. I’ve spent more time this Summer casually journaling, which has helped me become a bit more comfortable with writing. I’d like to think I’ve gotten through the first-year-posting jitters⁠06 and the fear of being perceived; I’m hoping to be on my way to posting more thoughtful posts like I originally wanted.!#@p!#@Balancing Friends & Clubs!#@p!#@I think during your first-year there’s a lot of pressure to talk to everyone at any chance you get⁠07 simply because you want to tackle the school year with as many friends as possible. This was nice to meet new people but also definitely exhausting for me. Some of that pressure has finally worn off, which makes going out with friends to events and around Boston feel a lot more natural.!#@p!#@I’m also finding myself enjoying the activities and their communities I’m involved in this year more. It’s nice to be able to take a more active role in certain clubs once learning what really interested me about them. For example, I joined Student Events Board Exec this year, and it’s been nice to feel more comfortable with the team and help plan bonding activities!!#@p!#@Arts & Crafty Things!#@p!#@When my senior year of high school kicked in, my brain began to register that I would be going to school out-of-state with limited storage capacity. I spent most of that year with friends before leaving for college, and some of my art-related hobbies slipped to the side. I ended up giving away a lot of my art supplies since I knew I wouldn’t bring them with me to college, but I started painting again this Summer.!#@p!#@I’m hoping to stay in Boston this Summer, so I’m feeling a bit more optimistic in my ability to keep up with painting, especially since I’m having a lot more fun with it now than ever before. My roommate has also recently gotten into scrapbooking, and I was quickly sucked into the world of stationery yet again. I also want to try crocheting, pottery, and embroidery at least once during this semester!!#@p!#@I know the sophomore slump™ may be inevitable, and that this whole blog has been incredibly optimistic. To be clear, I’m still ~very scared~ of college, classes, and psets, but those are just a couple of things I’m looking forward to this year :’)!#@p!#@I talked mainly about school and my own interests, but I’m also excited for my friends and family. My brother is in his final year of undergrad, and my family will be attending our first college graduation ceremony! It feels poetic that I’ll hit the half-way mark when he’s walking across the stage graduating, and I can’t wait.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/pre-sophomore-year-2/
“What the hell is water?” by David duKor-Jackson,Thinking about and understanding your own context…,by David duKor-Jackson,"August 27, 2024","In his 2005 commencement address to the graduates and assembled guests at Kenyon College, noted author David Foster Wallace began… “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’”!#@p!#@(DFW went on to deliver a timeless and celebrated address that is well worth checking out when you have the chance. )!#@p!#@I find that I am frequently referencing that story as I think about the challenges we have getting applicants to share information and insights about their lives in ways that help us to contextualize their achievements.  We have struggled in the admissions office to craft questions and prompts that elicit substantive and meaningful responses. While I accept the possibility that we just haven’t gotten the prompts quite right, I think it is more likely that a) applicants simply don’t understand what information we are looking for, and b) even if they understand what we are looking for, most people, including those who apply to MIT, have a difficult time thinking about and articulating what is most meaningful about their own lived experiences.!#@p!#@Within our large and exceptionally talented pool of applicants, students routinely produce impressive academic portfolios of achievement and distinction.  There are, however, important qualitative considerations in how we assess and evaluate what we determine to be exceptional,  and it is partially up to applicants to help us to identify the true trail blazers. As I have said repeatedly over the years, “the factor that is both most salient, and most likely to swing an admission decision in a highly selective process, is what an applicant makes of the opportunities that are available to them.”  A corollary is that “…we may look just as favorably on the trajectory and distance traveled as we do on the heights achieved.”!#@p!#@This is all to say that in order to best evaluate applicants it is helpful to have an understanding of the “water” in which they are swimming, or context as it is more commonly referred to.  DFW explains “The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.”!#@p!#@Ultimately though, we are dependent upon what applicants choose to tell us, and if they choose not to share anything of substance, we have a lot less to base our decisions on.  So while I wish that I could leave you with something more concrete along the lines of “do this” or “don’t do that.”  Instead, I have to hope that making you aware of our interest in the water in which you are swimming gives you sufficient inspiration to think more deeply and share more readily, the contextual insights that help us to better understand you and your achievements.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/what-the-hell-is-water/

Social Engineering by Allison E. '27,no no wait not like that–,by Allison E. '27,"August 24, 2024","Alternatively, how to build a cult! Only it’s not a cult, it’s just a group of friends, I swear!!#@p!#@Alternatively, mansplain manipulate man…ufacture mischief? In which I mansplain how my friends manipulate each other manufacture mischief opportunities to spend time together.!#@p!#@So many ways to title this blog, so many ways to sound truly, deeply weird.!#@p!#@But the urge to yap has taken hold, and I shall oblige it, because orientation is beginning on campus right now!⁠01 As this post goes up, prefrosh are jumping right into Residence Exploration (REX!!), where they’ll explore MIT’s many different residential communities and make their final choices about where to live.!#@p!#@REX is fun, and REX is exciting, but REX can also be a bit of a stressful time. People talk a lot about how important your living group is to your “college experience,” whether it’s becoming best friends with your roommates or being super involved with your dorm. And they’re not wrong about how great residential community can be–it’s a big part of many MIT students’ lives, and living with your friends means you see them organically every day. This is particularly useful when the rest of college is… not super conducive to that. There’s no single cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and no shared bell schedule that determines when everyone is free, so if you don’t literally live with your friends, it takes effort to organize time with them.!#@p!#@Residential communities are the cheat code, so finding a good fit for yourself can feel high-stakes. I was super nervous about this during REX, and even more so after I realized that my dorm floor wasn’t the best fit for me⁠02 . Some people have zero problem with this, whether they’re just great at planning things with friends or don’t really need to be around people all the time. Unfortunately, though, that’s not me, and I was really worried that I would miss out on the closeness of those residential friendships.!#@p!#@But fear not! As I’ve learned over the last year, residential communities are absolutely not your only option. There are so many ways to find your people in college, and I want to talk about one specific option: friend groups.!#@p!#@As middle school as that phrase feels, my “friend group” has been the best part of my MIT experience. Of course, 99% of the reason for this is that MY FRIENDS ARE AWESOME AND I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. But I’ve already talked about this, and also you’re not allowed to steal my friends, so I want to focus on something much smaller but still pretty cool: When it comes to finding consistent opportunities to spend time with friends, the “group” part of “friend group” can be great at mirroring the dynamic of residential friendships. If of my friends didn’t know each other, I’d have to constantly coordinate disjoint times with each of them independently just to hang out, and with the way our schedules interlock, that’s tough. Sith a group, we still coordinate stuff one-on-one like this when we can, but since we all do know each other, we can unlock so much more hangout time just by gathering whoever is free at any given time.!#@p!#@Again, since we’re focusing on the “group” part of “friend group,” you’re on your own when it comes to finding the friends⁠03 . What I’m more interested in is how that nebulous initial cluster of half-strangers becomes an actual, solid friend group that replicates the closeness of residential friendships. The social engineering! The cult formation! The manipulation!!#@p!#@RE: social engineering: I was very annoyed to discover that this term is usually used to describe advanced phishing techniques, which is… not what I’m talking about. The more relevant definition is this: “the use of centralized planning in an attempt to manage social change and regulate the future development and behavior of a society.” Which… does sound very manipulative, and I swear I’m not trying to promote manipulating your friends 😭. Or at least, not unless you’re all doing it to each other. To spend more time together! So it’s really just… persuasion. For an excellent cause.!#@p!#@Anyways. That’s what I really want to talk about (although you’d never guess from how it took me 700 words to get to the point…). You have a group of people who like each other, but you all live in different places, and there’s no organic impetus for you to assemble. How do you fix this?!#@p!#@First of all, group chat. I mean, you don’t need me to tell you that, but let’s go deeper.!#@p!#@I feel like group chats are such a defining feature of our generation’s social structure–and by structure I mean structure. There’s nothing as cut-and-dry as being in the group chat or not being in it. That really, really sucks sometimes, and I imagine that people pre-internet had much less rigidly defined⁠04 friend groups than we do now.!#@p!#@As exclusionary as group chats can be, though, they’re also one of the best resources for facilitating opportunities to hang out. Without a group chat, the only way⁠05 you’ll all end up in the same place again is by pure chance. Even if it’s awkward to start one, I suggest making group chats early, and often.!#@p!#@While we’re on the topic of making group chats, though, I want spread some personal propaganda: I really believe that group chats should be constructed with the same attention you’d give to crafting a physical living space!! Most people make group chats on Instagram, or Whatsapp, or Facebook Messenger⁠06 . This is perfectly fine for smaller groups, but once you start getting more than [insert arbitrary number… 7??] people, you might have more conversation than a single thread can handle.!#@p!#@Say you’re in the middle of planning an outing to Boston Commons, and you have to confirm that Person A is free on Saturday at 12:00. In the meantime, though, person B has a funny story from class, and person C wants to know where everyone is eating dinner. Boston Commons gets buried, person A doesn’t see the message, and on Saturday you find out that person A can’t make it, and now everyone is sad :(!#@p!#@This is why I’m a pretty big fan of Discord, because with a Discord server, you basically have one group chat with many different “channels”, or threads of conversation. You can have one for announcements, so people don’t miss that Boston Commons is happening on Saturday at 12:00. You can have one to post group dinner receipts, one to collect quotes, or even one for extremely scientific polls⁠07 . Then you can go further and make sub-group chats–for example, a temporary “thread” that everyone going to Boston Commons can add themselves to⁠08 . Discord servers also allow for concrete manifestations of inside jokes, whether it’s through custom emojis, channel names, wonky bots, or stupid nicknames. Just like how you’d decorate a physical living space!!#@p!#@Thinking about group chats as living spaces isn’t just an infrastructure thing, though–it’s even more relevant when you’re actually using them to gather people. With residential communities and their physical living spaces, one of the best things is that you can just pop into the hallway or floor lounge to find dinner companions. But with a non-residential friend group, there’s nowhere you can reliably find everyone.!#@p!#@That is, except for the group chat!!!#@p!#@Looking for a lunch buddy? Text the group chat. Need some homework help? Text the group chat. Want someone to do something very stupid but very funny with you? Text the group chat. The group chat can function just like a physical floor lounge or hallway in terms of gathering people together, and in fact, in some ways a group chat is even more useful, because you lift the need for physical & temporal alignment in organic interactions. If you have a random thought, or see something funny in the hallway, or just feel like talking, you can message the group chat at any time. More importantly, you unlock the ability to plan group activities without having to gather everyone in person. I seriously have NO IDEA how people did this before smartphones…!#@p!#@Even with a group chat, though, it can still be a bit tricky to plan things. (After all, residential communities have funding and social chairs whose job is planning activities.) We’re all still figuring this out, but here’s a few observations from last year: First, MIT has so many free student events going on all the time! Look at posters, keep an ear open, and most importantly, check your dormspam⁠09 . It’s a lot easier to gather folks to go to a pre-established event. Also! Make sure you know what times people wake up. We never did anything on a weekend before noon⁠10 , because all of us were asleep. Even when we said we’d wake up for something, we did not 😭. Finally, proposing shenaniganery in person has been slightly more successful, even if the details are worked out online. You get a better gauge of people’s interest, and humans are very bandwagon-y, so if we see each other interested in an activity, we’re more likely to go.!#@p!#@Ok, so shenanigans are awesome, but people are busy allll the time, and consistently planning things still takes effort. This is where routines come in! Every day, as classes wind down, my friends and I always gather in the same space⁠11 to study together. From there, we grab dinner together around 6:00, and after that a subset of us will even branch off to study in one of the dorms. We try to send location updates to the group chat so that even more people can join, but at any point in this journey, someone might send a variant of the “where (are) people/ppl?” text (>100 of these show up in our chat). More ways to leverage the group chat! Hooray!!#@p!#@It genuinely makes such a difference to have this routine, and to know that I can find people to hang out with if I need. I might have club meetings every Tuesday afternoon, and others may have classes or rehearsals or very necessary naptime, but if I’ve had a rough day of classes, I know for sure that at least one person will be in our study space to goof off with between 2:00 and 6:00 pm. We don’t need to plan days in advance every time we want to study or grab dinner together, we just do. Like clockwork. And that consistency means a lot during the chaos of the school year, so if you’re able to create some group routines, they can be great.!#@p!#@Or, well, maybe you’re 10% of the way there. Kinda.!#@p!#@Jokes aside, these structures really have helped me feel just as close with my friends as if they all slept two doors down the hall. I’m actually glad that my residential community didn’t quite work out, because that’s partly what lead me to the friends I have now. They really are absolutely the best part of MIT, and getting to see them almost every day means the world ☺️.!#@p!#@Then again, everything I’ve described here is very anecdotal and specific to my friends and I. The structures that work for you could be completely different, and besides, structures can only do so much. It’s really just about finding your people, which you can do through your dorm, but also so many other ways that aren’t right here, right now. You will find your people! You will find your people, and you will find whatever dynamics work for you, and you will make plenty of mischief together :D!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/social-engineering/
MIT after SFFA by Stu Schmill '86,"technology and the dream, deferred",by Stu Schmill '86,"August 21, 2024","Today I spoke with MIT News about the impact the Supreme Court’s decision in the SFFA case had on the composition of the Class of 2028, why it matters, and what we plan to do next. You should read that interview, as well as an accompanying message from President Sally Kornbluth.!#@p!#@Here, on the blogs, I want to share some personal reflections on what this means to me, both because I am ultimately responsible for the makeup of our undergraduate student body, and also because MIT has been my home for more than forty years.!#@p!#@One hot summer day, many years ago now, I packed a green Army surplus duffle bag full of all my clothes and boarded a Greyhound bus to Boston. I arrived at South Station, took the Red Line to Kendall Square, and walked along Memorial Drive until I got to Killian Court. I remember standing there, seeing the Great Dome for the first time, all on my own⁠01 and feeling just enormously intimidated by the place.⁠02 It was freshman orientation in August 1982, and I — a skinny seventeen year old Jewish kid from a public high school in Queens — was about to begin my college education at the most famous institution of science and technology on the planet.!#@p!#@I moved into New House — a dorm known even in the eighties for its multicultural community —  where I shared a forced triple⁠03 with Scott from New Jersey and Victor from Lynn, two guys I met by chance in the barbecue line and with whom I became fast friends.⁠04 In those days, Paul Gray was the President of MIT,⁠05 and could often be seen trundling across campus making spirited conversation with freshmen and faculty alike. Because I was small, but loud, I was recruited to be a coxswain of the crew team.⁠06 I figured out pretty quickly that I was practical and liked working on projects with my hands, so I declared Course 2, where I took 2.03 with Jim Williams,⁠07 2.70 with Woodie Flowers,⁠08 and 2.72 with Ernesto Blanco,⁠09 among others.!#@p!#@Jim, Woodie, Ernesto, and the rest of my professors taught me a lot, but like most college students, I learned even more from my friends. Like many MIT students before and since, I could not believe my good fortune to be surrounded by such incredible company. When I think back, most of what I learned at MIT and its value wasn’t even really in the classroom itself. The laws of physics are the same everywhere, and I could have picked up the basic principles of engineering from a textbook at the New York Public Library.⁠10 It was my fellow students — who hailed from Georgia to Guyana and everywhere in between — that made being at MIT so special.!#@p!#@I found myself surrounded by smart, kind, creative people, who came from around the country and the world to attend MIT because we all wanted to solve hard problems in the company of brilliant peers.⁠11 What we didn’t realize, but soon learned, is that what enabled us to actually teach and learn from each other was that we had such different ideas and experiences,⁠12 but were united by a shared standard of academic excellence,⁠13 a collective interest in science and technology,⁠14 and a sense of mission to use our interests and aptitudes to serve the nation and the world.⁠15!#@p!#@I wasn’t all on my own after all. I had all of them, from every walk of life, with me every step of the way down the Infinite Corridor.!#@p!#@My classmates and I benefited from the fact that, even back in 1982, MIT already had a long history⁠16 of advancing equal opportunity and racial integration in STEM education. Seventy years ago, in May 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education; a few months later, MIT hosted what is believed to be the first national conference on the topic of anti-discrimination in higher education. During the early days of the Civil Rights Era, the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid (CUAFA) directed more recruitment at predominantly minority high schools, and the student-run MIT Science Day Camp⁠17 evolved into the federally-funded national program Upward Bound.!#@p!#@Then, in 1968, MIT launched the Task Force on Educational Opportunity, chaired by then-Professor Paul Gray and including faculty, staff, and student leaders.⁠18 The Task Force had a clear sense of purpose⁠19 and moved rapidly to greatly expand MIT’s recruitment⁠20 and financial aid,⁠21 incubate the student-led programs that became MITES and Interphase, and undertake other bold initiatives,⁠22 including student-run tutoring programs for Cambridge youth that exist to this day. In a report reflecting on the early years of these initiatives, Paul described the vision and values that guided these initiatives in his plainspoken manner:!#@p!#@Decades later, long after his presidency and subsequent chairmanship of the MIT Corporation, Paul led the search committee that hired me as the Dean of Admissions in 2008; he also served on CUAFA. In my first few years in this role, he and I got lunch several times a semester, and I have always been grateful for his mentorship, guided as it was by both his mind and his heart. Paul never stopped being an MIT professor, first and foremost; he helped teach me everything I learned about the important work with which I had been entrusted.!#@p!#@What sticks with me most from those invaluable conversations was Paul’s personal conviction that his initiatives to diversify MIT⁠23 constituted the most important work he had done in all of his time in our leadership. Paul knew, as well as anyone ever has, that the key lesson an MIT education teaches is the skillful self-confidence that no problem is too hard to tackle, and he thought it was crucial that this lesson be made more broadly available.⁠24 He impressed upon me that carrying on this legacy of meritocratic pluralism — the synthesis of diversity and excellence — was an essential responsibility for the Dean of Admissions at a place like MIT.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GCP-00008711.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/INTERPHASE_Jim-Gates_1975.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fred-Johnson-Lynda-Sharpe-Charles-Kidwell-and-Peter-Richardson-Director-of-Admissions-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/John-Mack-with-files-800x562.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HS-student-visitors-to-MIT_1972-800x552.jpg]!#@This responsibility looms large in my mind, and weighs heavily in my heart, as I contemplate the change to MIT brought about by the Supreme Court’s decision in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (SFFA) case last year. In an interview with MIT News today, I discussed the impact of the Court’s decision, why it matters, and what we plan to do next. I encourage you to read the full interview, but here are the five key things you really need to know:!#@p!#@For a very long time, there has been no topic in college admissions more controversial than the consideration of race. In my sixteen years as Dean of Admissions, I have heard every complaint and critique you can imagine from every political, professional, and personal perspective. There are those who believe that MIT has cared too much about diversity, and there are those who believe we have never cared enough. There are those who believe we have been racist by using race-conscious admissions to enroll diverse classes, and those who believe we have been racist by reinstating our testing requirement. These viewpoints are so diametrically opposed, and so deeply held, that it can feel impossible to reconcile them and persuade people to find common ground.⁠38!#@p!#@So I’m not going to attempt that in this post.!#@p!#@Instead, I want to tell you what I believe.!#@p!#@I believe that every student we have admitted on my watch was admitted because they were demonstrably well-qualified for, and well-matched to, the MIT education, and because we saw how their presence in the class would improve the collective experience for everyone. We have long valued potential over pedigree,⁠39 and our egalitarian approach⁠40 to evaluating excellence across contexts⁠41 has enabled us to select students whose potential might have been otherwise masked or limited⁠42 without compromising the quality of the class. I believe this not only because I have read applications, seen what we demand for academic standards,⁠43 and advised generations of first-year students, but also because as MIT has become more broadly diverse, academic outcomes have improved for all students⁠44 and we have simultaneously become more attractive to the most talented students from all backgrounds.⁠45 As in metals and magnets, the strongest materials are alloys, where many different materials are mixed together to achieve composite strength that can collectively withstand the greatest challenges. The same is true of our student body.!#@p!#@I believe that MIT’s longtime strategy of using standardized tests to recruit students and validate academic preparation,⁠46 combined with the narrow consideration of race before SFFA to draw from the full breadth of human talent,⁠47 had long helped diversify and strengthen MIT, as well as the industries and institutions downstream of the Institute. I believe this because according to the American Society for Engineering Education, over the last decade⁠48 MIT has graduated more engineers from historically under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds⁠49 than any other private college or university (and the vast majority of public universities) in the United States.⁠50 These students have gone on to thrive as leaders in academia,⁠51 industry, government, and many other fields. We should be proud of this legacy and the alumni who constitute it, and we must find ways to continue to educate future generations of diverse STEM leaders in this new legal landscape.!#@p!#@I believe that the answer to the question of “how much diversity is necessary to benefit the MIT education?” is fundamentally qualitative, not quantitative.⁠52 However, I also believe that when there are now fewer African-American first-years enrolling at MIT than when I was a freshman more than forty years ago, that cannot possibly be the right outcome for our community; not in a country as large and increasingly diverse as ours, and not at an institution with our history and our values. While we must comply with the law, we also must also find a way to hold our pathways to leadership open,⁠53 or we may all experience long-term downstream consequences concentrated in the already-unequal area of STEM,⁠54 where we most need the creativity and insight generated by broadly diverse teams⁠55 inventing the future of the nation and the world.!#@p!#@These convictions underpin our recommitment to the institutional mission — articulated in the message that President Sally Kornbluth sent the MIT community today — that Paul defined for the Task Force⁠56 more than half a century ago:!#@p!#@As I told MIT News, throughout the last year, my team and I have been meeting with student leaders, faculty committees, and President Kornbluth and her team to explore what we can do to uphold this mission while complying with the law. In addition to the expanded recruitment and financial aid initiatives we launched last year with their support, we have also created new pathways for students to demonstrate their math and science preparation beyond what is locally available. These initiatives proved necessary, but not sufficient; we are dismayed, but not discouraged. We believe, as generations of MIT’s leaders have, that no problem is too hard for us to tackle as a team.!#@p!#@We do not know, yet, where these initiatives will take us. When navigating unknown territory, we must often rely on compasses over maps: guided not by a well-trodden path to a certain destination, but instead oriented by the powerful magnetism of our longstanding institutional conviction that MIT becomes, as Paul put it, a stronger, more effective place as it draws on the full range of human talent and experience.!#@p!#@This compass point remains, as I wrote last year, “the North Star by which we will steer through uncertain waters ahead.” Like any long, hard voyage, we will need favorable winds, an able crew, and a steady hand at the tiller to make the passage together. My four decades at MIT give me confidence that no matter what else is happening in the world, on this matter, we will all be rowing together, hard against the current, until we reach the shore.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GCP-00008711.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/INTERPHASE_Jim-Gates_1975.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fred-Johnson-Lynda-Sharpe-Charles-Kidwell-and-Peter-Richardson-Director-of-Admissions-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/John-Mack-with-files-800x562.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HS-student-visitors-to-MIT_1972-800x552.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-after-sffa/
Home Under the Dome by Emiko P. '25,"sorority recruitment, tips, and my experience",by Emiko P. '25,"August 14, 2024","Now that it’s August, the fall semester is right around the corner – which also means sorority recruitment will be here before we know it. Because sorority recruitment inevitably has some confusing aspects – What is a sorority? How do I sign up? When is recruitment? What’s the commitment? – I thought I’d explain what Greek life at MIT is like, especially as someone who was at first hesitant to the idea. Despite the initial hesitancy,⁠01 joining my sorority has ended up being one of the one of the best and most impactful decisions I’ve made regarding my MIT experience.!#@p!#@Whether you are interested in joining a sorority or are just curious, I encourage you to read and learn more about the process!!#@p!#@What is Panhel? MIT has six sororities, and the MIT Panhellenic Council (Panhel) is the umbrella organization overseeing these sororities. It is basically an organization that encompasses the sorority side of Greek life at MIT. Panhel is the largest women and non-binary community on campus (making up ⅓ of all undergraduate women at MIT!), and it helps cultivate, support, and guide the sorority experience.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor9-7-400x533.jpg]!#@Overall, recruitment is a huge organized effort.

I had my doubts at times, and nothing is ever perfect, but I’m truly happy with how this decision of joining a sorority has turned out for me. I am in no way saying that everyone needs to join a sorority, but I am saying that finding a living group and a community has enriched my MIT experience. If you find something at college – a club, a dorm, an athletic team, a friend in one of your classes, a UROP team – that evokes a similar feeling to what I just talked about, then nurture those relationships and hold on tight.!#@p!#@I can’t wait to see so many new faces on campus this year, and I hope everyone has a fun last month of summer before we’re back on campus in August!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor2-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor1-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor5-800x1030.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor6-800x532.jpg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor9-7-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/recruitment-400x568.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor2-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor1-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor5-800x1030.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sor6-800x532.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/home-under-the-dome/

[Guest Post] a space for women at mit by Kanokwan T. '25,by Nandini Choudhury (WXGS Assistant Director),by Kanokwan T. '25,"August 12, 2024","The history of women at MIT is long and rich.⁠02 Originally, women were not allowed to enroll—which was normal of universities back in the day— but much has changed since then.⁠03 One thing that’s changed is dedicated physical space. I’m thankful that there’s a lounge carved out on campus for us: the Margaret Cheney Room.!#@p!#@I’ve studied at a lot of lounges around campus; few have impressed me as much as this one. It feels cozy yet spacious. There are rooms for both the quiet and the conversational. In this space, you can do most anything: I’ve taken naps on the couches, grabbed coffee from the Keurig, and had good work sessions at the river-facing tables. To top it all off, it’s located in the heart of main campus. I thought to highlight this space, so I asked Nandini, one of the main staff members who runs the lounge 04 , to tell you more about it.!#@p!#@Hello!

The Cheney Room is a lovely space, and if you want to learn about the Cheney Room and the WXGS Office, check us out at studentlife.mit.edu/womenmit!!#@p!#@In 1884, recognizing the importance of providing a space dedicated to women’s needs, especially in the context of the STEM fields, MIT founded the Margaret Cheney Room. In light of its founding mission, the Cheney Room underwent a large renovation that was started in 2021 and was completed in February 2023.!#@p!#@Before the renovation, the Margaret Cheney was smaller and many repairs needed to be managed. WXGS received the Margaret Cheney endowment that allowed the renovation to occur, and working with MIT leadership, allowed the space to be expanded to women and non-binary individuals.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Before-2-800x618.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Before-3-800x618.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Before-1-800x618.jpg]!#@The space now exists to promote community and empower all students at MIT who experience gender-based systems of oppression as it relates to being a woman, the experiences of womanhood, and/or the complexities of gender diversity.

"TESS Science Conference III by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26",My first science conference!,"by Jenny B. '25, MEng '26","August 7, 2024","This summer, I started a new UROP⁠01 with the MIT Kavli Institute of Astrophysics and Space Research, and it’s one of the coolest things I’ve gotten to do at MIT so far.!#@p!#@The project is involved with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which is a NASA/MIT-led satellite that monitors and sends pictures of the sky for signs of exoplanets.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-7.14.37-PM-400x216.png]!#@One of the methods that scientists use to detect exoplanets is the transit method. When an exoplanet orbits a star and passes in front, it causes the light coming from the star to the Earth to dip, which is a possible sign that there could be an exoplanet in that area.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/656348main_ToV_transit_diag-400x171.webp]!#@Sometimes, stray light from the Earth and Moon and reflects off of the lens hood and camera lenses. This is called scattered light, and it can cover up possible signs of exoplanets and other cool space phenomena in TESS’s images.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/download-1-e1723064696615-400x401.png]!#@The project that I joined aims to remove these scattered light effects from the images with the power of machine learning. The ML model is given information about the actual image, as well as TESS’s relative position and orientation to the Earth and Moon, and then gives a prediction of what it thinks the image would look like if the scattered light wasn’t there. Researchers already have ways to remove unwanted noise from light curves, but hopefully this project can show how ML can help preserve the quality of the image data before light curves are generated from them.!#@p!#@Joey, who built up this project for a whole year under the supervision of Dr. Roland Vanderspek and Dr. Daniel Muthukrishna, just graduated and is off to get his PhD. He helped catch me up to speed with the code this summer, from pre-processing data to generating predictions. Luckily the third TESS Science Conference was being held this year, so we got to present a poster! Considering that this was my first conference, and that I got my registration fee waived, I was stoked to go.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240807_182025-400x578.jpg]!#@The TESS Science Conference is held every three years, where researchers involved with all aspects of the TESS mission gather and share their research. I met all sorts of people, from undergrads to post-docs, from astronomers to data scientists. I got to talk with people who came from places all over the world, such as Hawaii and Switzerland.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-3.10.54-PM-800x983.png]!#@Each day, there were presentation sessions grouped by topic that were hosted in Kresge Auditorium. It was my first introduction to the world of astrophysics. Coming from an EECS background, I had to Google some of the astro-related terms—concepts like hot Jupiters, sub-Neptunes, and asteroseismology, as well as missions like CHEOPS and ARIEL.⁠02 Whenever someone who’s well-known in their field came up on stage, Joey leaned over and whispered to me, “That person is a BEAST.”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-6.40.39-PM-800x519.png]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-4.49.47-PM-400x290.png]!#@Either coffee breaks or poster sessions, both of which were hosted in Sala de Puerto Rico of Stud 2, were interspersed throughout the week. Other than how long they were held, they were pretty similar. Posters were displayed throughout the room, and people would grab whatever snacks or coffee were being offered while chatting with people, either explaining their own poster or asking others what their poster is about.!#@p!#@I was intimidated at first to be in a room full of super-smart people. But these sessions soon became one of my most favorite parts of the conference. First of all, the food? Delectable. I definitely took too many lemon-icing pastries.!#@p!#@Joey did almost all of the talking because he’s been with this project for a year, and I’d alternate between standing by the poster and checking out other people’s research, occasionally grabbing an extra raspberry-lime seltzer. When I asked him how he’s so good at public speaking, he said 6.UAT⁠03 helped him improve, which I’m going to try to take before I graduate.!#@p!#@I also got to talk with people who I never imagined I’d get to interact with. When a NASA researcher came up and asked us about our poster, I got so excited when I saw “SETI Institute” on his badge (“Like from Contact!”) and asked him about what it’s like to work there. I chatted with several astrophysics researchers and asked them questions that have been bouncing around in my head since the start of the conference (“Why do people keep talking about hot Jupiters?”).⁠04 I even met two other rising seniors who are majoring in physics and astronomy at Dartmouth, and I got to learn about what their coursework looks like (“Linear algebra also kicked my butt so hard that I had to take it again.”).!#@p!#@This week, it’s back to work. My new model just finished training after an eon as I write this sentence, so I need to add some code to the evaluation/prediction process tonight. But it was really inspiring to hear astro researchers talk about how they could see this UROP project being integrated into exoplanet research.!#@p!#@You could say that this whole experience has been a sweet memory.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-6.38.45-PM-400x379.png]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-7.14.37-PM-400x216.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/656348main_ToV_transit_diag-400x171.webp;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/download-1-e1723064696615-400x401.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240807_182025-400x578.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-3.10.54-PM-800x983.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-6.40.39-PM-800x519.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-4.49.47-PM-400x290.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-07-at-6.38.45-PM-400x379.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/tess-science-conference-iii/
Christianity at MIT by Kayode D. '27,An intro to Cru!,by Kayode D. '27,"August 7, 2024","I’ve been trying to write a blog about Christianity and Cru at MIT for literal months now. Every time I start writing it I feel like I’m not doing it right, and then push it to the backburner. But now this just feels TOO IMPORTANT to NOT share with incoming freshmen that might be interested!!#@p!#@Before I came to MIT, I was often asked by my parents about the Christian groups on campus and churches in the area. I knew next to nothing and would have LOVED a blog about that sort of thing when I was coming in. I knew Cru existed but not much about it, and after coming to after spending a year with the group I would 1000% recommend it to anyone interested in God and staying connected to Christian community.!#@p!#@What IS Cru?!#@p!#@Cru is a caring community of individuals committed to sharing the love of Jesus Christ with people on campus. We do tons of events throughout the year to connect students and grow together. We do our weekly meeting on Tuesdays (called Cruesdays) in the student center, and it’s a highlight of my week. It’s a time that I carve out of the chaos of MIT to do no work and hang out with believers and friends. We have speakers come and talk about different topics, and I get to play drums on the worship team. We also do Life Groups, which are small groups outside of Cruesdays where you can grow with a group of people. The people are amazing, the lessons are great, and it has definitely been one of the best things I’ve participated in since coming to MIT.!#@p!#@Christianity and Boston!#@p!#@One of the really cool things we’ve done in the last year has been connecting with other colleges in Boston and their Cru groups. In the fall, we hosted an event called Cru Boston Citywide where we invited students from across Boston to meet up and connect. People from Harvard, Wellesley, Babson, Tufts, (and a bunch of others that I’m probably forgetting) came and hung out at MIT, and we shared testimonies from each school and how the Lord was working on our campuses. I played on the worship team for this event and practiced for like 20 hours leading up to this.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/blurry-cru-kids-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/clear-cru-kids-800x534.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/drummer-kayode-800x1198.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/me-and-lil-bro-mide-800x534.jpg]!#@In the fall we also went to a retreat with these students to New Hampshire, and that was ALSO great! A lot more students came to this, and it was here that I found out that MIT has one of the biggest Cru groups of any school in Boston. We had speakers come to talk about Shalom, or the peace of God.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mit-at-fall-retreat-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Boston-Fall-Retreat-2023-50-1-800x533.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fall-Retreat-800x571.jpg]!#@We do lots of events across Boston is what I’m trying to say. Some students even come from their college to MIT regularly to join us for Cru!!#@p!#@Life Groups!#@p!#@While doing things with the large group of Cru has been great, one of my favorite things has been life groups. People describe life groups as the people that you do life with. You meet up once a week to read the Bible together, ask questions, and learn more about life. It’s usually made up of people from your own or surrounding dorms, but you can really go to any group you want. It’s a great way to get connected to people and grow together. I initially thought that it just sounded like extra work, but it is genuinely so rewarding and fulfilling when you pour into it. It’s great to have that smaller support network, and there’s plenty of groups to attend. A (non-comprehensive) list of life groups includes Athletes in Action, Ignis (focused on the Afro-Caribbean student community but legit anyone’s more than welcome to join), New Vassar, BANANAS (Believers at New and Next and Simmons), and even one dedicated for freshmen!!#@p!#@The freshmen life group has already started doing online meetings on Wednesdays to get to know one another (led by someone you might know 👀), and you can get involved through: cruservants@mit.edu!#@p!#@Cru is also very flexible about creating new or different life groups depending on the need or interest (e.g. we’ve had Big Questions-type groups in the past, where people of any or no faith can gather to talk about the big questions of life and the universe). One of the great things about this fellowship is that it is very student-led, so if there is something you want to start or join then you can definitely take the initiative to do so!!#@p!#@For example, I forget what the motivator was, but me and a few friends who all live in Simmons Hall wanted to start meeting in the mornings to pray and read the Bible together. I’ll admit that I’ve never been good about consistently setting aside time to read my Bible and in the beginning this was a struggle. We wanted to meet at 8 AM (which is earlier than you think) and I had to start going to bed earlier and committing to waking up when I really didn’t want to. I learned so much during these times (Matthew 8:18-22? Crazy!), and it has been a game changer to have people I can grow in faith with.!#@p!#@Reason for God!#@p!#@During IAP we do a series called Reason For God. During this event (and also at various points throughout the year), we have speakers come to MIT and give talks open to the entire community. Anyone who is interested in the topic or has questions can come listen and it’s one of my favorite parts of the year. These people aren’t just random people either. They are professors and scholars and astrophysicists – people who can relate to the thoughts and questions that an MIT student might have. We’ve heard talks on finding proof for the Bible, and the credibility of the Gospels and the Christmas Story, and on the question of whether Christianity is delusional or dangerous. It’s led to some great discussions, and I’ve always looked forward to these talks.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Reason-for-God-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cruesday-open-mic-night-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/david-and-runako-at-free-hot-choc-800x600.jpg]!#@Churches, because I know I wondered!#@p!#@Students in Cru attend a number of churches in the Cambridge and Boston area, and most are either a walk or train/bus ride away. Thankfully, most have multiple services so you don’t have to wake up at the crack of dawn. Groups leave together on Sunday mornings, too, so it’s not as daunting as I initially thought.!#@p!#@To summarize, there is a strong Christian community at MIT and Cru has been my favorite part of it. I am SO ECSTATICALLY PUMPED for this coming semester and to get to meet all of the incoming freshmen if you choose to visit Cru! We’ll have events throughout REX week and the start of the year, and if anyone has any questions about Cru or something relating to MIT, you can feel free to message cruservants@mit.edu or reach me through dada@mit.edu!!#@p!#@More information at mitcru.com or @mitcru on instagram!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/blurry-cru-kids-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/clear-cru-kids-800x534.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/drummer-kayode-800x1198.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/me-and-lil-bro-mide-800x534.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mit-at-fall-retreat-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Boston-Fall-Retreat-2023-50-1-800x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fall-Retreat-800x571.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Reason-for-God-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cruesday-open-mic-night-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/david-and-runako-at-free-hot-choc-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/christianity-at-mit/
"feelings from the summer I wish I could describe more accurately by Alan Z. '23, MEng '24","partially inspired by ducks, newburyport","by Alan Z. '23, MEng '24","August 5, 2024","I’ve been living on campus, working on finishing my MEng thesis this summer. It’s been an interesting summer; I’ve really enjoyed being able to put my head down and sort of dig into the work, and although there have been ups and downs, I think it has been, on the whole, a pretty good summer. One thing I’ve noticed this summer is the presence of what I will call Big Feelings™, in the sense that I feel like many of the experiences and emotions I’ve had are actually broken down into these fractally spiraling, smaller thoughts and feelings. Here is my best attempt to describe some of them:!#@p!#@a satisfaction in being able to play decently well, surprisingly, after years of not having practiced; a continuous panic to try and reduce the impossibly difficult scores that they give players on Broadway to something you can actually play while still allowing the actors to follow you; the satisfaction of executing that reduction live; the enjoyment of letting the singer lead while you follow them through whatever tempo changes they’d like; the frustration of trying to help read difficult rhythms out to the singer, which is somehow impossible despite your best efforts and years of musical training; the challenge of (or failure to) playing six different vocal lines at once in different octaves; the nice and simple joy of learning new tricks for running rehearsals while being a useful and minimal part of a fun process!#@p!#@a surprisingly common feeling; one that feels like riding a stationary bike, which is, you know, not fun unless you’re into that kind of thing; an increasing sense of desperation as you get closer and closer to the end of the day; a relapse into bad code management, that despite knowing you should individually commit and test each change you make, you just want to get something working and you can unravel it later (you can’t); a questioning about whether you know anything, actually, about what you’re doing; the toxic cocktail of knowing you should step away from your computer and take a walk and try something else later and yet not being able to put things down until you’ve actually made progress; checking the time on your computer and realizing it’s three hours later than you thought it was and you should probably be asleep, but the laptop is so tempting…!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240719_224022270-EDIT-1-1000x750.jpg]!#@a fear from self-knowledge that you’ve never successfully exercised regularly, despite your best efforts; the wondering if you’ve somehow been psychologically scammed by the discount; the calculation about how many times you have to go for it to pay off; the calculation of how many weeks, exactly, you have left in this town; the tentativeness of watching the bill hit your credit card; the excitement of heading to the gym for the first time afterwards and getting a little key tag with a barcode on it!#@p!#@the nostalgia of spending the Fourth of July in Boston again, of all the memories you’ve had there in years past; the fact that, driving up I-95, you somehow spot all the places you went on during The Long Walk from Maine to Boston, and you also kind of miss that walk despite all the pain it caused you; the fact that you’ve been to Portland three times with friends and have done so few things beyond the art museum and Peaks Island; the knowledge that that art museum is one of your favorites, and, yes, having a “favorite art museum” is incredibly pretentious but the first time you went to Portland you had just discovered you liked art museums at all, and how much we have changed in the past three or four or five years, but the places we visit look the same!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240706_193207786-800x602.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1830-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1787-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240615_223326509-800x602.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240706_163029226.MP_-800x1063.jpg]!#@a simple feeling: the comfort of being warm in the cold, like cuddling up in a blanket in the winter, but also the annoyance of it being way too cold in the buildings, all the time, when you wish you could just wear a T-shirt and shorts instead!#@p!#@the excitement at finally making progress; the frustration that the seven other things you spent twelve hours yesterday on only gave you at most a 10% benefit, but here you are; the forgetting that sometimes you need to take the seven other paths to learn enough to get the progress from that eighth path; the satisfaction of watching runtimes go down; the acceptance that sometimes this is how progress is, plateaus followed by cliffs, and at least the cliffs go up instead of down in this metaphor; the questioning of what amount of improvement will finally be enough for me to feel satisfied with all this work!#@p!#@the enjoyment of looking through the things on the shelves, some of which you actually recognize and have a context for; the weird joy of being a poetry snob; the irredeemable desire to own more things that you might not finish reading (though you have finished the last three plays and poetry collections you bought); the wonderment about how people actually find books they didn’t already know about; the adventurous feeling of buying a book you have no context on because it sounds cool, even though you are about as far from adventure as a person can physically be (i.e., the book store), if you subscribe to the conventional definition of adventure; the just sheer joy of walking out into the night, holding three books in your hand like a student; the knowledge that each of these books was individually cheap but together they cost way more than you would have liked; the smell of all the paper, the feel of the texture as you thumb through the side of each book, the sound of the words as you read the first poem aloud: “To the Fig Tree on 9th and Christian…”!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240724_010734686-1000x753.jpg]!#@the satisfaction of having that discounted membership pay off, for some sense of the word; the feeling that this might actually be the one tolerable form of exercise to you, because 1) you’re tall and that’s a “loophole I’m gonna exploit the hell out of” and 2) it’s kind of fun to treat it like puzzle solving; the wondering hesitance of whether this habit is going to last once you move; the knowledge that you should probably also be working on other things as well (cardio); the observation of the incredible things that other people can do with their body that you will still probably never be able to do; the excitement of having a friend to go with who can point out things to do or try and who you can do your best to help as well; the weird social environment of people at so many different skill levels and whether or not to offer/receive unsolicited advice from them; the immense satisfaction of being able to do things you weren’t able to do last time; the feeling of having your forearms puffed up at the end of a session, barely able to hold on to anything anymore; the fear of falling off the wall and the elation in the conquering of that fear!#@p!#@the instant question of “why is this document over sixty pages long”; the fear of missing something in those sixty pages and knowing that this is probably the most important Terms and Conditions that you’ve ever signed; the comfort of knowing that you’re going to have a place to live when you move; the bittersweetness of leaving town, and semi-permanently, knowing how much you’ve grown to love the whole New England vibe, the way the towns and parks and streets have a certain poetry to them; the excitement of starting a new chapter with a friend; the gratitude towards your roommate for managing the whole process and the shame in not contributing as much as you ought to have; the worry that you now have to start actually cleaning your room so that you can move across the country; the wonder about exactly how long you can survive without buying a bed if you already own a couch!#@p!#@the unsettling calculation about how much money, exactly, you’ve spent at this place; the shame and pride that the waitress now recognizes you and doesn’t even wait for you to sit down before she’s placed your order (which is always the same); the awareness that you only have one more Wednesday left before you’ll have to wait months to go to this place again; the overwhelming love you have for their food because it just brings you comfort in a way that food has scarcely ever done; the fact that it almost made you cry once; the freedom of having a schedule where you can, in fact, take the train three stops to eat at a restaurant on a weekday; the fact that no matter how many times you have the pork cutlet curry, it always reminds you of your freshman year, making curry with strangers in an East Campus kitchen, feeling truly at home and welcome at MIT for the first or second time!#@p!#@the disappointment in yourself for actually knowing things about this game, now; the unsolicited opinions about the gameplay that you now have and which try to keep to yourself; the elation of watching your friends win and the uncertainty of the in-between moments where it feels like it’s inevitable that one team will lose, but it takes another twenty or thirty minutes for that to happen or sometimes they mount a comeback; the weird feeling that you could never really commit that much time to playing games but you spend just as much time on YouTube if not more; the mild shame that right now the only video game you’re playing is Minecraft, where all you’re doing is digging out a 16×16 hole and then filling it with dirt, which is surely even less productive; the joy in just getting to spend time with friends, even if it’s online, watching them play a game, because they still play the game in subtle ways that match their personality, which is what made you friends with them in the first place!#@p!#@the feeling of looking at a problem in your head like mentally visualizing all the nooks and crannies of your own room; the satisfaction of being able to spin that system around in your head despite that phrase not really having semantic meaning; the shame of knowing there are still corners of this algorithm you have treated as a kind of “black box” even though you have already unraveled so many layers of this particular onion; the calmness that you imagine from someone meditating at the bottom of the pool, the heavy and fruitful waters of knowledge gently splashing above you!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240711_011606622-1-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/climbing-800x1067.jpeg]!#@the joy of following a conductor again; the comfort in knowing that, no matter how lost you are, you can always find the downbeat at the podium; the re-invigorated section leader instincts to breathe in and lift your head before entrances despite the fact that you are playing piano, not violin, and there is nobody else in your section; the uncomfortable fact that you aren’t watching the conductor quite as much as you would like a player to be watching the conductor if you were conducting; the feeling that music is so much more collaborative than you remember it being, and that somehow you know things now, funnily enough, between helping with sound equipment and knowing what the parts of a drum kit are and baton management; the thought that maybe you should start a band some time, because this is just plain fun, making music with friends, but that is perhaps a dream for a later you with more time and practice!#@p!#@the mortifying ordeal of being known; the excitement that “somebody actually reads all this junk I make”; the genuine heart-warming of people liking it, especially people who you know (through virtue of the context) are much more intelligent than you; the wonder about what writing you’re going to do next and who will see it, and whether you need to live more to be able to write more, and “what does that even mean, anyways?”; the reminder that your writing is important and impactful, writing is important and impactful (it is important and impactful)!#@p!#@(but also not knowing many more things); the feeling that “I’m so lucky to have all this,” to be decent or maybe good or at least okay at computer systems/architecture, and writing, and music, to varying levels, but certainly to love doing all of them so much; the fear that I will let the desire to be good overtake the enjoyment of it; the sadness about all the things I could’ve learned more about but never got the chance or time to, like chemistry and biology, all the branches pruned off the tree of possible paths; but, man, I am so happy to be who I am and to have learned so much and to have so much more to learn, and so soon (but I do have to finish this thesis)!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240719_224022270-EDIT-1-1000x750.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240706_193207786-800x602.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1830-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1787-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240615_223326509-800x602.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240706_163029226.MP_-800x1063.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240724_010734686-1000x753.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240711_011606622-1-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/climbing-800x1067.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/feelings-from-the-summer-i-wish-i-could-describe-more-accurately/
Home is where the Heart is by Anika H. '26,visiting my grandparents,by Anika H. '26,"August 4, 2024","Featuring my sister’s drawings cuz she’s awesome.!#@p!#@I went to China for the first time in 6 years this summer. Although 9th grade of high school didn’t feel all that long ago, I could only remember a few blurry memories of restaurants, relatives, and a zoo.!#@p!#@I flew over to California a Monday afternoon and stayed there with my family for a day before heading out together for China the next morning. While I packed pretty light, bringing just a few clothes for the week, we brought 8 suitcases in total, many filled to the brim with gifts for our relatives. When mom couldn’t fit everything, my suitcase was eventually used as overflow. We hauled ourselves and our bags onto the 14 hour flight. The best part was that not many people took this flight, and nearly everyone on the plane got an entire 3 or 4 seat row to themselves. My sister, parents, and I all took turns entertaining my little brother, and somehow, I managed to get him to sleep for an hour or so. Exhausted and jetlagged, we then caught a train, and got picked up by an auntie to go to my grandparents’ house in Fuxin, a small city in the Liaoning Province of China.!#@p!#@My grandparents have gotten visibly older and weaker, and it sucks seeing them like this, knowing that they’re only gonna get older. Grandpa’s gone deaf, and grandma needs help walking now. They raised me since I was born and stayed in the US with us until I was 14. The last time I visited them was in the 9th grade of high school, so I was super excited to see them again.!#@p!#@We got visits from relatives, many many many relatives. So many relatives I don’t even remember how they’re related to us anymore. I’m just going to refer to them as uncles, aunties, and cousins for the rest of this blog.!#@p!#@The first few days, it felt a little awkward getting back into the habit of speaking Mandarin. My vocabulary was more lacking since the last time I last went, and I had a very slight, albeit audible American accent. Despite being guests ourselves, we spent a lot of time entertaining the other relatives that all decided to meet up at the same time.!#@p!#@One of the aunties that lived in the area tried to take us clothes shopping, and with my sister and I being socially awkward nerds in another country, we just ended up trying on weird outfits at the behest of the employees. I caught my sister throwing them some bombastic side eyes for their tastes in fashion, and I had to briefly excuse myself to snicker off to the side where they couldn’t hear.!#@p!#@The next few times we went shopping were a lot more casual. I ended up learning *fashion* from my sister and getting styled up in clothing stores. She thinks I look better in oversize clothes. Everything is ridiculously cheap. For maybe the price of a weeks worth of groceries, we got two massive bags of clothes and shoes, totaling around 60 items. I think we did an entire year’s worth of clothes-shopping that day. Besides that, I found it really funny that the stores had NKTE and NZEK shoes. They stocked Daidsa instead of Adidas, and ENT RONEH TACE instead of THE NORTH FACE. I had a ton of fun snapping photos of off-brand names.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-2-e1722795340601.png]!#@While I could engage in polite conversation with our relatives and my sister was hiding from human interaction, my little brother was having a blast, making friends left and right. It was quite the scene watching my little brother harass a distant cousin and playfight him until the poor guy was out of breath. Between our cousin threatening to toss him off a bridge and simultaneously begging for mercy, I had to intervene at times for the sake of my brother’s safety and our cousin’s sanity.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-17-scaled.jpg]!#@Every morning, grandpa and I would get up early to go to the breakfast market. There were people selling fish and fresh meats, steamed corn and tofu soup, fresh fruit, steamed buns and desserts galore. In other words, all the flavorful food and groceries you can’t find in the US for dirt cheap. Then again, I’m biased towards Asian cuisine. The cost of a batch of tofu soup for 5 people is less than that of a bag of chips in a Boston vending machine.!#@p!#@For 3 days in a row, I helped my grandpa haul a giant watermelon across the entire market and up 6 flights of stairs because there’s no elevator. Grandpa’s quite fit for his age, but he’s 90 and his age is catching up to him, and his legs aren’t getting him anywhere with that watermelon. When we got back, he told my parents that I was pretty much as reliable as a son, which made me very happy because that’s high high praise coming from an Asian grandpa.!#@p!#@We ate out at restaurants with family style meals and spinning center tables. Unlike the US, where everyone orders their own dish, people order a bunch of food to taste and share together. The entrees were mouthwatering to say the least. The two times we went, I ate until I had no space left for dessert.!#@p!#@As we were living there, I helped bring grandma food, trim her fingernails, carry things up the stairs for my grandpa, and do other little things around the house. It felt nice to be depended on. Whenever they told me that I’ve grown, I became more acutely aware of my future responsibility to my family.!#@p!#@I didn’t know enough engineering vocabulary to tell grandpa in detail what I was learning in school or tell grandma about the fun community I found, but I knew enough to let them know I was doing an internship, excited about learning, and generally doing pretty well. Grandpa looked really proud every time a neighbor asked if I was his grandkid, gloating about how I just came back from the US. He kept trying to buy us more popsicles.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-15-800x450.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-16-800x600.jpg]!#@Grandma can’t go down the stairs, but we were more than happy to hang out with each other inside the house. I showed her my fire spinning videos, and she kept asking me whether I had a boyfriend yet. Then I hear grandma’s cousin tell my 9 year old little brother that he should find four wives when he grows up. There’s a bit of a cultural disconnect, but I see they care for us all the same.!#@p!#@by the way, my sister’s actually really good at art.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-1.jpeg]!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-2-e1722795340601.png;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-17-scaled.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-15-800x450.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-16-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/China-1.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/home-is-where-the-heart-is-2/
my STORY of helping Wyoming students shoot for the STARS by Nicole Cooper,get it? do u get it??,by Nicole Cooper,"July 31, 2024","!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2601-scaled-e1722433744529-1000x621.jpg]!#@This spring, I had the chance to reconnect with my rural Wyoming roots through my work at MIT. As someone who has made the journey from a rural upbringing to working at selective institutions, I often wondered how to give back.!#@p!#@In Fall 2023, I joined the inaugural STORY (Small Town Outreach Recruitment and Yield) Trip, which took us through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1492-400x533.jpeg]!#@This spring, we traveled to New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and my home state of Wyoming. I was thrilled to join the planning team and attend the second trip, especially after enjoying the first one so much. As the lead planner for the Wyoming stop, I was excited to bring the college fair experience back home to students who might never get the chance to visit institutions outside of their home state.!#@p!#@Planning the 5 stop college fair was a whirlwind but so satisfying. Teaming up with folks from Rice, Yale, USC, Barnard, and Case Western, we dove into every detail together. From reserving space to host students, sending out invites, and developing content to present, to even renting cars and purchasing plane tickets—we had so much to do! This was especially challenging during the busiest time of the year, when each of us had many competing priorities. Coordinating across different institutions and time zones wasn’t easy, but it was totally worth it. We connected with the STARS (Small Town and Rural Students) College Network and managed to both plan and execute a five-state/25+ institution traveling college fair through rural America!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3497-400x631.jpg]!#@Traveling in a van with reps from Harvard, UChicago, and Rice, we shared laughs, explored new places, and tried local cuisine. Beyond the college fairs, the hours spent on the highway turned out to be quite a highlight; one of the best parts of road tripping through small-town America is learning about the culture and eating at local restaurants. We ate some of the best New Mexican Food at Jerry’s Cafe in Gallup, drove through Navajo National Monument and were awed by its vast landscape and rock formations, learned about the history of potatoes at the Potato Museum in Idaho, and finished out with the breathtaking (and cloudy) views of Grand Teton National Park.!#@p!#@While we appreciated the beauty of the rural American West, the real magic happened in the connections we made—with each other, with students, with counselors, and with local communities. We aimed to show them that they can seek amazing opportunities outside their hometowns and return with fresh perspectives. Seeing the students’ excitement in realizing their potential, which is beyond what they had when they first walked through the doors, and receiving heartfelt thanks from high school counselors, inspires us all to continue the work that we do.!#@p!#@Ending the trip in Wyoming was particularly special for me. Jackson Hole High School was gracious to host us, and as the school counselor handed me the microphone after her warm welcome I was in awe seeing the room was packed—filled with over 300 students and guests from over 200 miles all across Wyoming, here for what they called “a once in a lifetime opportunity to speak with so many institutions.” Thanks to the efforts of the planning team, the University of Wyoming (Go Pokes!) and Jackson Hole High School, we put on what (we think!) was the largest college fair in Wyoming history, and the highest attended event of the trip—no small feat for the least-populated state!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2633-e1722434165597-800x484.jpg]!#@Speaking to all of these incredible rural students from my home state was both nerve-wracking and incredibly fulfilling. The students’ reactions to having 25 institutions visit their state reminded me just how personal and significant my job is. The students were beyond grateful for the chance to connect with universities from all over the country and felt that this event opened doors they hadn’t even imagined existed. I totally understand where they’re coming from. Growing up on a farm in rural Wyoming, college felt like a distant dream, and every step of the process was a daunting challenge that consistently felt unreachable.!#@p!#@Rural students still face significant access barriers to higher education. After all, it’s easy to feel discouraged when the nearest institution is a four-hour drive from home (through the mountains, I might add), and the closest Ivy+ institution is a ten-hour journey away—if not more! Seeing their excitement and hope for the future reminds me why this work is so important. It’s about making dreams feel attainable and helping students discover a world of possibilities and opportunities they didn’t know existed. We will continue to highlight their unique talents and bring knowledge of opportunities to rural America with trips to small towns every fall and spring.!#@p!#@After the event, I reunited with an old teacher of mine who had driven five students from my old high school three hours through a snowstorm just to attend the college fair. In his words, ‘An opportunity like this doesn’t happen in Wyoming.’ Thanks to STORY and STARS, now it does.!#@p!#@Students visiting from Wind River High School (3 hours away) and catching up with my old teacher!!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2601-scaled-e1722433744529-1000x621.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1492-400x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3497-400x631.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2633-e1722434165597-800x484.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-story-of-helping-wyoming-students-shoot-for-the-stars/
A Summer in DC by Jessica Z. '27,what i've been up to this summer!,by Jessica Z. '27,"July 30, 2024","Happy middle of⁠01 July! I haven’t blogged in a long time, and I have quite a few posts from the end of the school year that I still need to revisit. As Kano mentioned in her blog post, I’m also trying to make a more conscious effort to catch up with blogging to my current life, but words are hard. Nothing’s quite surfaced yet :’)!#@p!#@That being said, I’m working in Washington, DC this summer through the MIT-Washington Summer Internship Program! I’ve been to DC three times before this summer: once on a middle school field trip, for three days last summer, and for a week during spring break as part of MIT-Washington’s orientation.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0522-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0485-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0383-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0368-800x533.jpeg]!#@I took my last final in the Spring and was soon whisked away on an airplane to land in DC. I’m working at a biomedical and public health organization this summer, which has definitely been a unique experience that calls for its own blog post. Outside of work, though, the MIT-Washington Program and all the interesting spots in DC have given me a good chance to explore the DMV area!!#@p!#@Here’s some things I’ve been up to:!#@p!#@Congressional Baseball Game!#@p!#@The Congressional Baseball Game is held in Nationals Park every summer in mid-June! If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a bipartisan baseball game played by members of the United States Congress. I’ve never been to a baseball game before, but it was a very chill day :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4435-800x533.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4453-800x533.jpeg]!#@Georgetown Flea Market!#@p!#@Every Sunday, Georgetown has a Flea Market with vendors selling a mix of vintage, modern, hand-made, and revamped goods. It reminds me of the Fenway Flea in Boston but with a bit more jewelry and artistic goods. I went nearly every Sunday just because each week brought something new. I ended up buying a few pieces of jewelry, one of which was from a local seller who I ended up talking to for a bit about how he became interested in jewelry making. It was very wholesome, and he gave me a few tips on how to get started with jewelry making!!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4760-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4749-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4764-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4778-800x1000.jpeg]!#@Site Visits!#@p!#@The MIT-Washington program organizes weekly visits to policy-related organizations in DC, ranging from smaller think tanks, to non-profits, to large government organizations. Oftentimes, the speakers are MIT alumni, and it’s been interesting to talk to past students about their winding paths into policy.⁠02!#@p!#@We’ve been able to learn about a lot of different fields: AI ethics, biotechnology, agricultural policy, international relations, foreign affairs, economics, etc. I admittedly came in pretty solely interested in healthcare or public health policy, but I’ve left every event with a little bit more knowledge about just how vast the policy world is. Here’s some of my favorite sites:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5245-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5266-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4EB9E327-E132-420E-9206-4AAD3B83C0F7-800x1000.jpeg]!#@MIT Community Dinner Party!#@p!#@I’ve been going to a lot of food places, both with the MIT-Washington program and with other friends staying in DC this Summer. My favorite food experience, though, was when we were invited to Kat Jiang’s house for a dinner party!!#@p!#@Kat (@chefkatdc) is an MIT alum⁠03 and one of the coolest people I’ve been able to meet. She was super involved in the UA⁠04 and East Campus, and she pivoted to culinary school a few years after graduating. She’s a pastry cook at Seylou Bakery, chef instructor at Cookology Culinary School, and has made it a hobby to host amazing themed dinner parties :)!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2873-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2872-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2871-800x1000.jpeg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2870-800x1000.jpeg]!#@Lightning round of some other fun DC things: museums,⁠05 4th of July fireworks,⁠06 Smithsonian Zoo,lots of bakeries, botanical gardens, DC food festival, water lily festival, and visiting new & old friends.!#@p!#@I’m not usually a fan of the summer,⁠07 but this summer has passed by so quickly.⁠08 I came into this summer quite stressed, so it’s been a kind reminder to me on how important it is to rest.!#@p!#@It’s a nice change of environment and pace—I’m not at school, I’m not at home, and it’s strangely comforting to try new things this summer. I’m also trying a new type of work⁠09 this summer, which has helped bring back more of my spark for learning.!#@p!#@I’ve been thinking a lot more about growing up since I primarily work with people who are many years older than me in education and life experience. Nearly every time I’ve talked to someone, they always wistfully mention that I should really savor my time in undergrad. I’ve heard this before, of course, but I think it really started to sink in this summer.!#@p!#@After my housing ends in early August, I’m heading home for two weeks before flying back to Boston to see friends and get ready for the next school year. A lot of first-year-like jitters have crept into my head, despite finishing my first-year, and I have a feeling it will feel like a new beginning again. I’m not usually a fan of change, but I’m excited, and I’m grateful that I’ve been able to spend this summer in DC <3!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0522-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0485-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0383-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0368-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4435-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4453-800x533.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4760-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4749-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4764-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4778-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5245-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5266-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4EB9E327-E132-420E-9206-4AAD3B83C0F7-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2873-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2872-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2871-800x1000.jpeg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2870-800x1000.jpeg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-summer-in-dc/
My Product Design Internship in Austin by Emiko P. '25,how to build things: both externally and internally,by Emiko P. '25,"July 26, 2024","Boy oh boy, what a summer it’s been so far. For the first time in my college career, I’m spending my summer working in the United States⁠01 – and where better to breathe in that sweet, American, summer air than in Austin, Texas? The land of cowboy boots, sweltering heat, and a city that took me no less than a week to fall in love with.!#@p!#@Austin is on top of an aquifer, meaning that it has a ton of rivers, lakes, and springs dotted all around the city. The one I frequent the most is called Barton Springs. It’s a sloping grassy hill that bottoms out into a narrow, deep river. It has an amazing view of Downtown Austin’s silver skyline, which looms beyond the dense trees crowding the river and parks. The spring is cold enough that I have to hype myself up to jump in. The initial plunge is an icy shock, like your eyes flying open and your body bolting awake after an all-too-realistic dream, but once you get used to it, the cool water washes the Austin heat away, and it becomes pretty soothing.!#@p!#@My roommate for the summer, Ottavia P. ‘25⁠02 , and I often go together. We bob around in the water for a bit, clamber up the slopes to read a book⁠03 , get all overheated in the UV that is surely at least 13, then jump in all over again.!#@p!#@One thing is always certain after spending an afternoon at the springs: you’re gonna be starving. Good thing Austin knows how to satisfy! I’ve tried juicy birria style tacos, thick Tex-Mex queso, and a burger from a Michelin star rated food truck that only sells one thing: Not A Damn Chance (NADC) Burger. I’ve eaten pizza slices the size of my face after a comedy show, tacos upon tacos after a night out on 6th street with the other MIT kids working in Austin this summer, and Vietnamese rice bowls with my coworkers. But not only have I been upping my foodie game this summer, I’ve also been upping my chef game.!#@p!#@Armed with some Airbnb-provided pots and pans, an air fryer, a trusty Zojirushi rice cooker, and an addiction to HEB⁠04 , I have transformed from a helpless, microwave-dependent college student to a burgeoning rival to Gordon Ramsay. My easy go-to’s are the following, in case anyone needs some inspo:!#@p!#@I’ve been playing with a WPSL team this summer called Austin Rise, which is a semi-pro team. I have practice three times a week, so I always come home ravenous. There’s nothing better than scarfing down a home-made dinner while watching an episode of Ted Lasso with my roommate. We started the first season at the beginning of the summer and are about to finish season three soon⁠08 .!#@p!#@And that’s life so far in Austin! It’s full of parks, rivers, new friends, cowboy boots (yes, of course I got some), wide open spaces, smiling strangers, and a good amount of traffic.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aus_2-400x205.png]!#@But that’s not all. I may be frolicking about Austin quite a bit, but I’m also working!!#@p!#@This summer, I’m doing an internship with a company called M3 Design, a product design and development consultancy. It’s a team of about 30 people that houses an industrial design team and a mechanical engineering team, as well as business and marketing teams. I’m on the mechanical engineering team as an intern! This company helps clients with any step of the product design process, which could be concept development, prototyping, strategy, user research, mechanical and electrical architecture, or design for manufacturing.!#@p!#@Usually focusing on medical, lifestyle, and commercial products, their clients range from medical giants to visionary startups. This means that some projects can take anywhere from five months to five years to complete. Since I started in early June, I’ve been put on six different projects. One of them is my intern project, where I am building a small, portable light that bridges the gap between convenience and luxury. This project has been a sprint from the beginning, and I have learned so much.!#@p!#@Don’t get me wrong, though, the start of a road to learning something new is always bumpy. Learning SolidWorks as a beginner from one of my mentors had me feeling like a kid learning to ride a bike for the first time. I was wobbling, even toppling over at times (Press this button here… No, not that one, the other one!). But over the course of my first week or so, I found my balance, settled my feet on the pedals – right foot, left foot – and slowly started to bike. Now, eight weeks later, I can hop on the bike, and it takes me most places I want. I still swerve a bit at times (Why aren’t these two parts connecting the way I want?), or I make some wrong turns (Uh… I think I forgot to save that part before I closed out), but I’ve learned how to right myself, to backtrack, to solve problems, and to continue on my way.!#@p!#@I’ve learned other skills, too, like how to do proper user need analysis to figure out what features a customer actually cares about. I’ve made little prototypes out of foam, then later 3D printed them. I’ve learned how to incorporate electronics, how to work with manufacturers, and how to make sure the thing I’m designing on my screen can actually be manufactured in real-life. My time at M3 Design has nurtured that little kernel in my brain that’s always asking why.!#@p!#@For example:!#@p!#@Why do I have to squeeze my detergent bottle cap like this to twist it off?!#@p!#@Hm, probably so the cap isn’t easily removed by little kids.!#@p!#@Why is my car key shaped so funky?!#@p!#@Oh, look, when you curl your hand around it, it fits perfectly.!#@p!#@How does this battery cover stay locked in without screws?!#@p!#@Aha! Because a little part of it hooks and wedges itself in. You know… I may incorporate that into my own project.!#@p!#@There’s something powerful in self-sufficiency and confidence – in knowing that you have the skills, or at least the knowledge of how to acquire them, to give a project a shot. M3 Design has gifted me a taste of that feeling. It’s like they’ve given me the materials, the wood, to start building a house.!#@p!#@And what’s funny is that, if M3 Design has given me the wood, then MIT has given me the screws, or the fasteners, to put it all together.!#@p!#@For example:!#@p!#@I need to see if this pin will be able to handle this much force on it.!#@p!#@Go back to your 2.001⁠09 notes and find the beam bending equations.!#@p!#@How can we try and make the lights dim?!#@p!#@Maybe we can use PWM. I learned that in 2.004⁠10 . I also can use what I remember from 6.0001⁠11  to code that.!#@p!#@How many hours is this battery going to last us?!#@p!#@I took 2.678⁠12 , I can figure that out.!#@p!#@With the real-life experience of M3 Design (along with all my past internships), and the theoretical knowledge of MIT filling in the gaps, I’ve built something incredible: a foundation. I can say that I have a solid foundation as an engineer, a steady base that I can continue to build on and grow as I pursue what I want in the future.!#@p!#@Upon this foundation, I may add the creativity of a product designer, the tenacity of a flight operations engineer, the guidance of a leader, the dreams of a writer, the logic of a researcher, and who knows what else. Sky’s the limit.!#@p!#@What’s important for you to remember is that this foundation was built from scratch, starting my freshman year at MIT. I did not come into college knowing what I wanted to major in or what skills I wanted to gain. All I had was my ferocious desire to learn – and it’s incredible what that and a healthy dose of determination can amount to.!#@p!#@So, don’t be afraid to dive into an unknown world, because before you know it, you will have built the foundation that a million different futures can rest upon.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/aus_2-400x205.png,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-product-design-internship-in-austin/
I Hate Superman. by Kayode D. '27,(I Love Superman.),by Kayode D. '27,"July 16, 2024","I never liked Superman.!#@p!#@I thought he was too idyllic.!#@p!#@If you asked someone what superpower they’d want, they’d probably say strength, or speed, or flying, or something like that. Someone might come up with a more unique power, like density control, or to control friction, or to forget things. But if someone told you that they’d have flight AND strength AND invulnerability AND heat vision AND frost breath AND … AND … AND… You’d call them crazy! Oh, they have no weakness, except for a rock that you can’t find on earth. I’d laugh if someone told me this is the power they’d want. He’s much too powerful, it’s like he’s cheating! He could beat almost any other superhero just by looking at them. I thought he was stupid.!#@p!#@During the Great Depression, he was born out of a need for a hero. But I can’t help but feel like he became a propaganda tool. Used to support the U.S., yes, but ultimately an unbeatable character that was over commercialized and pumped into by big corporations. I thought he seemed like a Boomer’s superhero, where they needed an underdog in someone like Superman, but now he is this behemoth titan hanging over all the weaker, new heroes of today. Think about it: for the last nearly 100 years Superman has been THE superhero. How many new heroes and stories have missed their chance to flourish because of Superman’s control of comic and superhero media? What about Speedball⁠01 ? I bet you don’t know who that is. Or Dennis Sykes⁠02 ? What about Detective Chimp⁠03 ? Why haven’t we seen more stuff about these characters with equally interesting stories? If Superman wasn’t so over milked then maybe other lesser known heroes could get a shot.!#@p!#@The only comic I had read of Superman that I remember actually enjoying was the Superman Doomsday: Death of Superman comics. It’s ironic: I liked him best when he could actually die.!#@p!#@I never liked Superman.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@I started running recently.!#@p!#@I came home from college having all these plans for how I would grow so much during these months at home. I’d have a job, I’d make lots of music, and I’d blog all the time, I thought. But this is hard. It’s hard to create a coherent thought for an entire blog post. Especially with the never ending, ever expanding existence of social media. I could go on (another) ten page rant about social media and the Erosion of Deep Literacy and my opinion on it all. It’s only getting more and more difficult to get out of it. We are literally fighting an algorithm designed to keep a chokehold on our attention, and it’s an uphill, losing battle. Day by day it only gets harder and harder to focus and ignore the distraction. It’s so easy to take the path of least resistance to get entertainment, and avoid monotony or boredom with music or scrolling or anything. I don’t think I’ve driven more than 2 hours in my entire life without listening to music. Is that bad? I don’t know. I just know that I’d rather not be alone with my own thoughts, so I listen to music to avoid it. I feel trapped.!#@p!#@My brother is jacked. Coming home and seeing him made me want to improve myself so I wouldn’t look so pale in comparison to him. At first I hated running, but I enjoy it now. I’ve created a habit⁠04 of running every night when it gets cooler, and I always borrow my brother’s airpods⁠05 to listen to music. One day, I was sick of feeling like I had to have a distraction to exist, and I was tired of being afraid of being bored. I didn’t take the airpods and ran without them.!#@p!#@I had been tossing around the idea of hating superman for a few days at this point. I thought about the way he looked in the justice league movie – a movie i haven’t watched except in passing. He was beating the Justice League on his own. He was one wrong move away from being a villain. He felt too powerful, too upright and just, too much.!#@p!#@As I thought about this, I ran over the hill in my neighborhood, and saw the sky above. It was awe inspiring⁠06 . I don’t know if the sky had ever looked like that at MIT, or if I’ve just never cared enough to look.  I was always too busy distracting myself from being bored by work or the lack of it. At that moment, I wished that I could just jump over all the houses and see above the clouds. I wished that I wasn’t so tired from running. I wished that I was Superman.!#@p!#@It was at that moment that I realized that I don’t hate Superman; I was jealous. I am jealous. I wish that I was Superman. I wish that I was as strong as him and I had a purpose and I didn’t feel pain or weakness. I wish I could do what he does and fly up into the sky and see the earth from his point of view.  wish I was Superman.!#@p!#@…!#@p!#@I started watching My Adventures with Superman. This show is awesome! It portrays Superman not as the hundred-year-old behemoth I had pictured in my mind, but as a young adult who was unsure of himself, and is still figuring out how to be not only Superman, but also Clark Kent. He is actually a person that struggles with things like everyone else: With his powers and his relationships, and with becoming the person that he wants to be. He’s not too strong or a boomer’s superhero. He’s awesome.!#@p!#@I didn’t like Superman, but I never really got to know him. My opinion was based on the little bit that I had seen, and the image I had made in my mind. And even the one thing I actually dug into, the Death of Superman comic, I thought was incredible! I didn’t even give him a chance, and I never went back to learn the life of Superman. He came from a small town in Kansas, living on a farm with a humble beginning. He had a weight on his shoulders, the weight of the literal world. Sure, he’s a titan, but he’s also Clark Kent, reporter for the daily planet. And I didn’t take the time to learn who Clark was.!#@p!#@Now when I think about Superman, I don’t think of the titan or the behemoth or the monster, I think of this panel.!#@p!#@There really are a lot of super things about Superman.!#@p!#@",,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-hate-superman/

Becoming a Mad Scientist by Emiko P. '25,a required class for all meches!,by Emiko P. '25,"June 24, 2024","Have you ever wanted to see how accurate you can make a GPS? Have you ever wanted to see just how hot your PC can get before it starts messing with its performance? What about designing your own heat sink? Or maybe figuring out the optimal scoop-ability of your favorite ice cream⁠01 ? What about the power of nerf gun bullets? Or maybe the power of a single footstep? Want to know the correlation between music and your lifting workouts?!#@p!#@These questions that bounce around our brain are fun to think about – but imagine if you had an entire semester to pursue that question by designing an experiment, collecting and analyzing data, and uncovering a conclusion. Sounds nerdy, but… also weirdly exciting?!#@p!#@This is 2.671, Measurements and Instrumentation, a communication-intensive class I took this past spring where we have a semester to pursue any research question we can imagine. This is a particularly special class because it is required for everyone majoring in Mechanical Engineering – which means that, after going our separate ways and taking different MechE classes the past two years, my classmates and I all converged again for this one class. Walking into lecture the first day was an Avengers Endgame moment, seeing the large group of familiar faces all assembled and ready to take on one of the most notoriously demanding classes.!#@p!#@We got right into it, and by the first week, we were brainstorming the research projects we would be working on for the rest of the semester. It didn’t take me very long to figure out what my project would be. When I got concussed my sophomore season and was returning to play soccer, I asked the doctor if I should wear a concussion prevention headband. It’s basically a foam headband that a lot of soccer players wear after getting concussed to prevent a reinjury. He told me, “Up to you, I’m not entirely sure if they work.” And thus, my 2.671 project was born!!#@p!#@I wanted to see if these headbands would actually absorb the impact of soccer balls as advertised and if they were to be trusted with a soccer player’s brain safety. I ended up simulating a concussion⁠02  and testing the headbands to see if the impact on your head changed at all compared to wearing no headband. Turns out: it did! The headbands absorbed 70-80% more of the impact than without the headband! WOW! I created a poster based off of my conclusions, then wrote a final research paper on the topic. It was kinda fun to know my topic inside and out and to produce scientific documents explaining my work.!#@p!#@This class always culminates in a presentation that looks like a big research convention, where all of us present our poster to the greater MIT community at the end of the semester. The event is held in Pappalardo Lab, where the sun shines brightly through the big open windows and sunlight hits our towering, gleaming posters set up in neat rows. Colorful graphs and arrows jump out at me, and each title snags my attention.!#@p!#@It’s so fun to go up to each student’s project and pepper them with questions – I take about 18 laps around the room in an effort to talk to everyone. Everyone is excited to talk about their work, and I am blown away by how deeply they know about their projects. Also, everyone’s projects are so creative and unique – like, how do you even come up with a project about the effect of alcohol on Mario Kart driving ability?!#@p!#@Here are some other super cool ones:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0003-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0012-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0004-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0005-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0001-800x600.jpg]!#@Looking at all these cool projects, I get a pretty surreal feeling, and time and space warps so that I see all of my classmates’ faces, a few years younger. I see us all as freshmen, new to MIT. We are uncertain of many things – of how we will fit into this new place, of who we are and who we may become. I see all of our aspirations, and I see the great hope that MIT will provide us with the answers.!#@p!#@Those younger faces morph back into the older versions of themselves. The ones who have, over the course of a semester, become mini-experts in everything from 3D printing to bowling mechanics. If only our freshman selves could see us now. If only they could see the research we’ve crafted, the passions we’ve discovered, the skills we’ve gained, and the people we’ve become.!#@p!#@I know that freshman year Emi would be so astonished by all that I have accomplished. I know that she would love to read my research and that she would look at the graphs on my poster with awe. And in that moment, as the culmination of all my classmates and I’s hard work hits me all at once, the feeling of pride plants itself firmly in my stomach.!#@p!#@Heading into senior year is an interesting time of reflection. It’s easy to become lost in the fact that we only have one more year. A year of lasts, of mourning, of clawing at time wishing for it to slow down.!#@p!#@Or…!#@p!#@Or it could be one more year to grow as we have grown the last three. Because if this is how far we have come in three years, just imagine what we can do in one more.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0003-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0012-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0004-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0005-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240516-WA0001-800x600.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/becoming-a-mad-scientist/

italy by Anika H. '26,research in pompeii,by Anika H. '26,"June 18, 2024","Hi! this is going to be a sorta long blog so here’s a tldr:!#@p!#@I went to Italy to do some light research and travelling, stayed in a castle, analyzed samples of roman concrete, learned how to mosaic and fresco, visited the colosseum, pantheon, and several archeological sites, did research on metal and mortars at Pompeii, set Tetazoo loose upon society, annoyed the frosh and local wildlife, and generally had a good time.!#@p!#@Last semester, I took (3.094) Materials In the Human Experience. It was one of the most interesting classes I’ve ever had, getting to learn about concrete and iron through a practical portion that involved building an arch and a smelting furnace. When they told us there would be a two-week research trip to Italy, I naturally jumped at the chance.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-1.jpg]!#@The two desginated adults of the trip were Admir and Mike, who each taught the concrete and metals portions of the class.!#@p!#@castle!#@p!#@“so anyway, we’re staying in a castle—”!#@p!#@wild cheering ensues!#@p!#@After landing in Italy, we took a bus ride down to Sermoneta, where we stayed in Caetani Castle for a week. We hauled our luggage up the cobblestone steps, smoothed by centuries of people walking through. I packed light though, managing to shove everything I could into a single backpack. The castle itself was beautiful. It had a moat filled with plants, a drawbridge, a well, secret tunnels, and hole above the gate to pour hot oil down on your enemies.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-24-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-22-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-45-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-32-800x1067.jpg]!#@When we got there, we spent a good while frolicking around the courtyard and running around on the castle walls. I tried to get into every nook and cranny I could as soon as I got there, but most of the doors that went to the interesting places were locked, and it took me two days of begging Admir for him to promise to open the doors over the weekend.!#@p!#@The tour of the castle was lead by the groundskeeper, Luca. He took us around the paintings and frescoes and showed us to the top of the little tower. While I would have liked to go to the top of the keep, the rickety stairs probably wouldn’t hold the weight of 13 people. We were shown around the stables as well and were told it held up to 50 horses at one point.!#@p!#@The small prisons held captured French soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars, and there were doodles all over the walls from them going on hunts and wanting to be freed. While we were there, I took this chance to briefly lock the frosh up in one of the prisons.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-9-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-30-800x600.jpg]!#@At night, I would often run up the stairs and spend a little while on the roof stargazing. Look up, and you’ll see stars and passing satellites. Look past the castle walls, and the town glimmers with light. Look in, and the frosh will be catching fireflies in the courtyard and standing on the edge of the well. The ground is warm and the air refreshing. I’ve caught myself falling asleep there.!#@p!#@exploring sermoneta!#@p!#@Sermoneta was a wonderful little town. One day during our free time, I took all the side roads I possibly can. It felt like a maze that was impossible to get lost in. No matter where I went, taking a flight of cobblestone stairs down lead to either of the main roads, and taking them up would eventually lead to the castle. The businesses and apartments were medieval style brick houses, often covered in lichen and flower vines.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-3.jpg]!#@For lunch and dinner, we would go down to a little restaurant called Antico Emporio. Despite the size of the kitchen, it made mouthwatering two-part meals. The pasta and meat were exquisite, and I don’t think I’ve had better potatoes in my life. The language barrier was initially a bit of a struggle, but we picked up some basic vocabulary from our professors and were able to communicate preferences and dietary restrictions. Whenever the owner asked how the food was, I’d give her a double thumbs up. We got breakfast at the place next door. Despite our usual timeliness (lack thereof), we were mostly on time for breakfast and our other daily activities, and soon learned that Tetazoo time, which is 15 minutes to an hour late, was just Italian time.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-27-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-26-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-25-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-46-800x1067.jpg]!#@There were a looooot of cats here. We saw stray cats about as often as we see squirrels around Boston. Most of them were quite shy, but I met an orange cat and a calico cat that learned how to beg for food quite effectively. The mama cat has four black kittens that were all a little skittish, and we’d find them scattering into planters and drain pipes whenever we walked by.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-28-1-400x533.jpg]!#@locations!!#@p!#@Terracina was the first of the archeological sites we went to. On the hike up, Admir asked us to point out everything Roman until we got far enough that there were entire sites full of Roman ruins. We were lead inside the base of an old temple, where restored mosaics were displayed and got toured around the ruins of the Capitolum. We took a few samples of mortar from the building (with permits of course) and wrapped them up to bring back. As Mike ran off to fuel his coffee addiction, the rest of us settled down for lunch, only to find half the lunch bags absolutely covered in oil from the rice. We spent the rest of the day at the beach. I was initially whining about the freezing cold water, but ended up spending the most time in the water collecting shells.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-21-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-43-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-44-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-42-800x1067.jpg]!#@In the afternoon, we visited the Ninfa Botanical Garden, created by the last remaining members of the Caetani Family. The gardeners there have the unique job of preserving both the ruins of the town as well as the overgrowth of the garden. Its trees grow extremely fast in its unique microclimate, towering at just 150 years old. It stays cool during the summer and warm during the winter. The guide also seemed really excited showing us around. Every other spot was “the most beautiful corner of the garden”, and for good reason I think. There were fish in the river, clear springs in the bamboo forest, and wild climbing roses enveloping tall trees. The Caetani who planted the garden was also a painter, making it so the garden changes color every two weeks throughout the year. Back on the bus, we joked about leaving Mike behind since he was the last one on, and he said he would be happy to stay.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-19-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-38-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-39-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-40-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-41-800x600.jpg]!#@Back in the castle, we put the samples of the mortar in an instrument called an FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). By loading on a small sample of a material, it produces an infrared spectrum of its absorption or emission, which can then be used to identify it from an online database.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-37-scaled.jpg]!#@The next two days, we learned how to mosaic and fresco from restorers and artists. We learned how to cut marble, mix mortar, use quicklime, and operate a thermal camera. We made two different styles of mosaics and a fresco of Caetani Castle, adorned with waves and eagles, the two symbols of its family crest.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-5-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-18-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-17-800x601.jpg]!#@We couldn’t stay in Italy without visiting Rome, so we took two days to go sightseeing. We were skipping lines at both the Pantheon and the Colosseum and getting tours with real archeologists that have done excavation work there. It felt like everywhere we went, Admir “knew a guy”. Though I know it must have taken an incredible amount of work to plan the trip and make reservations, it still felt like magic every time we were let in through the staff entrance or led around a sea of people in line. I tried my best to stick near the front and ask questions. I remembered seeing pictures of these places in my middle school history textbooks, but seeing the breathtaking Roman architecture in person was an experience on another level. There was definitely theme of “medieval folk recycling Roman architecture”, which I found amusing. The Colosseum was covered in holes from where the metal supports were stolen, and the bronze overhead support beams in the Pantheon were melted to make cannons and replaced with wood. There were still a lot of the sites left to preserve and uncover. When we stopped for lunch at a local park, I would see bits of arches sticking out of the grass.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-34-800x1066.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-11-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-13-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-15-800x351.webp]!#@In the second half of these two days, the lot of us were set loose in Rome to wander. We got gelato at a place with 150 flavors, and indecision paralysis took me for 10 minutes trying to figure out how to select only two. In line, I discussed the volumetric difference between getting a cup or a cone, and couldn’t visually discern the better option. Mike got several more expressos, half of us went Pokemon chasing, and the other half (Tetazoo) ended up at the Tomb of the Unknown soldier. The full cohort visited the Trevi Fountain as well and made wishes upon a coin toss.!#@p!#@Over the weekend, we hit Priverno, an archeological site where Admir conducted much of his research on Roman concrete. Intermittently swatting each other with millet grass, we walked the broken mosaics through the ruins of a Domus, a traditional Roman house. While the content was really interesting, I couldn’t help but get distracted by the ridiculous number of snails covering the fenceposts and signs. We went up to the archeological museum for lunch and sat down at a small restaurant. There was one guy. He was the cook, the server, and the cleaner, and it was the best artisanal pasta I’ve ever had in my life.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-14-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-10-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-35-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-33-800x600.jpg]!#@pompeii research!#@p!#@Aside from Caetani Castle, I think my favorite experience was doing research in Pompeii. It was the largest archeological site I’ve been to by a massive margin since it used to be an entire city. We stayed at a hotel very close to site and took a back entrance into the lab every day.!#@p!#@I’m not allowed the share pictures of the lab, but they had mountains and mountains of bones and artifacts. Chiara, one of the researchers there, showed us around. On one shelf were the skulls and 3D facial reconstructions of a family found in the remains. They found animal bones from dinners past and fruit offerings at temples. There were turtle shells, carbonized remains of fabrics, and jars upon jars of pigments. All of us came out of there bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready for the next three days of research.!#@p!#@I thought walking the slippery cobblestone streets of Sermoneta were bad, but Pompeii was worse. With exception for a few sections of main road with wide sidewalks, we walked on horse-drawn cart roads. With the unevenness of the stones, I’m sure the horses must’ve had really strong ankles. We split up into groups based on research topics. In the first half of our first day there, I didn’t really do much, and out of boredom, I went to check on all the others. I spent most of my time with Admir and the mortar group. They were in Larario de Achille, examining piles of gypsum and the content of the different layers of a half finished fresco. In another room, Marco and the Egyptian Blue group were taking and processing pictures of frescoes with modified night vision goggles to observe the florescence of the unique pigment. A few feet further, Gianni and the photogrammetry group were watching a loading bar, waiting for their scans of the room to render. Right before lunch, I ran over to George and Pablo, who were using the FTIR on samples from the lab. They were originally supposed to look over a paper from the 1800s regarding a mortar mix with lime, charcoal, and urine, but nothing much came of that.!#@p!#@In the afternoon, I started my research in the metals group with Edwin and Mike. We used another instrument called an XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) gun to analyze a bunch of metal artifacts. It measures the emissions of a material that’s been excited with an x-ray beam and then determines its elemental composition. We did most of our work in a huge warehouse full of larger artifacts with shelves filled floor to ceiling. I made quick doodles of the objects as Edwin took pictures with Mike’s camera, which has an incredible microscopic zoom mode that lets it take detail shots. When the gun beeps after 90 seconds, Mike reads me the values he got and I jot them down in my notebook. Rinse and repeat for the next 40ish artifacts. We ran through lead pipes, ceramic fountains, and bronze vessels of all sorts.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-6-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6051772-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-29-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-8-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-7-800x600.jpg]!#@We took a particular interest in the lead pipes. Since they were rolled up lead sheets, we XRFed the seams to see if the Pompeiians used a solder (they did). It was a lead-tin solder. The joints between pipes and valves had a different solder with an even lower melting temperature. When Mike went to get data in a slightly less structural area, I begged and bargained to go along, and got to see part of the hot water distribution system. On Friday, we presented our findings from the past three days.!#@p!#@Finally free from work, some of us decided to browse the Pompeii gift shops. I knew the Romans were like this but I was still unprepared for how many dicks I would see. There were rows and rows of bronze, wooden, and plastic dicks, dick can-openers, dick key-chains, and so on. Despite trying to walk along, the shopkeeper kept trying to show me more. I ended up going to the supermarket instead.!#@p!#@shenanigans!#@p!#@Since many of Tetazoo’s frosh joined 3.094 thanks to Anhad’s recommendation, a good portion of the trip was consisted of our shenanigans. Admir was constantly looking out for us like a concerned father, telling us not to stand on the edge of the well or get too far deep into the water. He nearly screamed when I tried to sit on the second floor railing at the hotel in Pompeii we stayed at, and seemed very worried about our steak knife sword fights at the dinner table. Like last year’s cohort, we started calling him Dadmir. Mike, in contrast, was relatively chill about us poking around. At the beginning of the trip, I got designated as town crier for addressing the two kings of the castle (Mike and Admir), imploring their majesties to graciously open the castle gate. In other words, I was being a pain in the ass and yelling from the courtyard to the third story window to get Mike. The lot of us would hang out together during free time and meal times. These were the times Roxxie collected a pile of cutlery at the dinner table, George curled up from getting teased, and Mike learned of me and Pablo’s pet leeches.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-4-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-12-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-16-800x600.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-23-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-31-800x1067.jpg]!#@For dinner at Pompeii, there was this weird hallucination of a restaurant we went to. It wasn’t that bad, it was just everything was ever so slightly off. They served Pepsi in glass bottles with plastic caps, they had a DJ playing remixed US pop songs(the set wasn’t even working half the time), it was supposed to be middle-eastern themed but only served Italian food, and had an odd way of serving food. As one of the others described, it felt like an alien trying to run a restaurant like a human and not getting it quite right. Roxxie was always super excited to eat here and would not stop laughing once we sat down.!#@p!#@As much as I enjoyed terrorizing the frosh, I also thoroughly enjoyed poking at the new wildlife around me. Aside from petting the stray cats, I kept trying to catch lizards and pigeons. There were orange beetles and fireflies at Sermoneta, I found two rhinoceros beetles in Pompeii. On the way to lab, I scooped up a dead Giant Asian Hornet and put it in a plastic jar that Chiara gave me. I plan to either CT scan it or take pictures of it under a scanning electron microscope.!#@p!#@This trip was solidly the most fun I’ve had the entire year.!#@p!#@Thank you Mike, Admir, and everyone who made this experience possible.!#@p!#@Special shoutout to Ellie for being an awesome TA <3!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-1.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-24-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-22-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-45-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-32-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-9-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-30-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-3.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-27-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-26-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-25-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-46-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-28-1-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-21-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-43-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-44-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-42-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-19-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-38-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-39-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-40-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-41-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-37-scaled.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-5-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-18-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-17-800x601.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-34-800x1066.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-11-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-13-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-15-800x351.webp;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-14-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-10-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-35-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-33-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-6-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6051772-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-29-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-8-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-7-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-4-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-12-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-16-800x600.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-23-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/italy-31-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/italy/
the world is blooming! by Allison E. '27,and so am i?,by Allison E. '27,"June 17, 2024","You know those “four seasons” posters that elementary school teachers put up on classroom walls? They always summer, fall, winter, and spring with the colors of a tree: from green, to orange, to white, to pink, and back to green. Even past elementary school, in fact–my high school’s orchestra room door had a textbook version of these posters for their concert (Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons”).!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20210715_110504_Original-Copy-400x300.jpg]!#@The last time I lived somewhere with four seasons (as opposed to constant summer) was in elementary school, so this is more or less the image of seasons that exists in my head. When it comes to summer, fall, and winter, I feel like these depictions do a pretty good job capturing what’s iconic about the season, whether that’s the sun shining on a sandy beach, or scarlet leaves caught in their moment of descent, or the sparkling blanket of freshly fallen snow. Even if motion is important to these moments–a breeze blowing, leaves falling, or snow drifting downwards–a single, static image is enough to capture at least the heart of those seasons’ joy.!#@p!#@But spring⁠01 ? Spring is something different.!#@p!#@I used to think the problem with these classroom posters was that trees filled with pink flowers aren’t even realistic, but I’ve learned the last few months that it’s not a lie. I thought it was just the cherry blossoms, because they’re all anyone talks about. And sure, there’s a good reason: cherry blossoms absolutely gorgeous. Trees with dark, delicate branches fully covered in soft pink petals–it’s flowers straight through, and they’re magical.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240403_162855-400x533.jpg]!#@The thing is, I thought it was just the cherry blossoms. I thought they were a hyperbolic archetype of pink-flowered trees–an exaggeration of a spring where some trees might grow a handful of flowers (speckled against a backdrop of green), and most do little more than sprout leaves and continue on their merry way. But it’s not just the cherry blossoms.!#@p!#@It started when I noticed the massive flowers emerging from a tree near Lobby 7, MIT’s main entrance to the central academic buildings. There weren’t a ton of them, and most of them were still tucked into their fuzzy little pods, but it only took them a couple of days to fully emerge.!#@p!#@About a week later, as I walked down dorm row to class, I noticed two trees with some buds emerging as well. They were pale green and fuzzy, large and… oh. They were definitely the same as the ones near Lobby 7. Except there were a lot more of them.!#@p!#@And then, day by day, the buds started opening up. I could see hints of pink. Then white. Then the petals started separating, and THEY BLOOMED!!!! I’ve never seen this many massive flowers bloom all at once and all in one place. It’s truly one of the most magical experiences I’ve had in nature–all these enormous petals gazing up at the sun with dark pink veins reaching up towards the white tips–and they were right along my daily walk from dorm to classes.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124759-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124817-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124806-800x1067.jpg]!#@Over the next few weeks, I quickly learned that the magnolia trees are far from the only things blooming on campus in April and May. I guess spring really does live up to the image of flower-covered trees (at least in Boston)! I have more than a hundred photos⁠02 in my camera roll of flowers all across campus, so I’ll put a handful below if you’re curious:!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240430_125027-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240510_124853-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240501_160306-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240521_1233302-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240513_1301462-800x1067.jpg]!#@But as beautiful and photogenic as all the flowers are, they’re not what I loved most about springtime. Certainly not the way that fresh snow is the most powerful moment of winter for me (I LOVE SNOW), or the way that a picture of auburn leaves falling captures the spirit of fall. For me, the defining experience of spring was not the flowers, but watching them grow.!#@p!#@I love walking down dorm row each morning to see the bushes just the slightest bit denser with green, or the daffodil petals spread out just a bit more beneath the sun. Every once in a while, I’ll notice a new color for the first time–the vibrant red of a not-quite-tulip(?) emerging from the ground, or tiny specks of green dotting a tree that was once bare. Then there’s the transitions past spring and towards summer–when the neon green⁠03 of freshly-budded leaves darkens to a deeper shade, or the flowers fall petal by petal⁠04 in what practically looks like snowfall.!#@p!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_125524-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240501_160418-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240320_165808-1-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240404_114922-800x1067.jpg]!#@!#@img[https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240508_1903092-800x1067.jpg]!#@Nature is changing at all times of the year, of course, but it’s so much easier to notice the little bursts of green appearing on the blank canvas of winter than it is to notice the patches fading to yellow against an already vibrant summer. There’s also just… the joy of watching things grow. Seeing the leaves emerge over the course of many days makes me feel like I’m a part of it all. I like to imagine that I’m the one turning the clock hands round and round, coaxing the flower buds open and unfurling leaves and slowly darkening the colors of springtime. It’s a grandiose little delusion⁠05 , but a fun one nonetheless!!#@p!#@Because of all this, the defining experience of my first springtime in Boston really has been watching all these slow and incremental changes around me.!#@p!#@Aaand maybe inside me as well, because now that I’m looking back on my first year at MIT, I’m realizing how many similarly slow ways I myself have grown.!#@p!#@In the day-to-day chaos of the semester, I always looked to “Things I Did 💪🏼” as my touchpoints of pride and growth–cooking a massive meal with friends, helping run an ESP program or Science Olympiad tournament, or traveling alone. But I didn’t really notice or appreciate the more gradual changes. With scores of new people met and new friends made, I’ve learned how to make conversation more easily. In meeting after meeting with my UROP⁠06 supervisor or lab, I’ve learned to speak with confidence about my work. From new club position to new club position, I’ve learned how to navigate new responsibilities (without the crutch of an experienced person directly beside me). I’ve learned how to take notes in lectures, I’ve learned how to shop for groceries (kinda), how to live with roommates, how to work with less sleep, and so much more.!#@p!#@There’s nothing photogenic about the process of learning how to shop for groceries⁠07 , even if the end product is rather nice. But it’s that slow progression–that transition from the tiny bud of a skill to a fully bloomed ability–that’s the experience that’s been the most fulfilling. And in this case, it’s not a delusion to imagine that I’m the one turning the clock hands round to make it all happen :D!#@p!#@P.S. As hard as I tried to capture the joy of watching everything grow with my deluge of photos, there was only one way I could do it a little bit of justice. So… here’s forty-five⁠08 pictures of the same tree along dorm row from March through May.!#@p!#@",https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20210715_110504_Original-Copy-400x300.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240403_162855-400x533.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124759-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124817-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_124806-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240430_125027-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240510_124853-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240501_160306-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240521_1233302-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240513_1301462-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240416_125524-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240501_160418-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240320_165808-1-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240404_114922-800x1067.jpg;https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240508_1903092-800x1067.jpg,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-world-is-blooming/
